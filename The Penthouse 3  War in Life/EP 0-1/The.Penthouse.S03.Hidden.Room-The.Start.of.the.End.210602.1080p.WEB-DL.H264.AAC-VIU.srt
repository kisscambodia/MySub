1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,645
(The start of the end of
The Penthouse 3 by keymen)

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,645
(It's my first time.)

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,814
(The unpredictable world of The Penthouse)

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,555
(It's crazy.)

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,884
(The three secretaries are appearing.)

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,655
(Just enough spoiler)

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,954
(Just enough suspense)

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,524
(Just enough push and pull)

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,934
(Revealing all the charms)

10
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,268
(New type of talk show...)

11
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:37,035
(by the kids of The Penthouse continues.)

12
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:42,974
(Revealing their real singing skill)

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,845
(And)

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,885
(The whole story of The
Penthouse 3 slowly reveals.)

15
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:53,785
(The footage of The Penthouse
3 is revealed for the first time.)

16
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,885
(Please send us lots of love.)

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,875
(The Penthouse 3 Hidden Room,
The Start of the End begins now.)

18
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,829
The Penthouse 3 Hidden
Room, The Start of the End.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,738
I'm your host, Jang Do Yeon.

20
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:04,834
(Jang Do Yeon)

21
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,765
- I'm Jo Jung Sik. - Hello.

22
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,268
In The Penthouse 3 Hidden Room today,

23
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,139
we're going to talk about...

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,609
the start and the end...

25
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,979
of The Penthouse.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,208
The Penthouse 3 Hidden
Room, The Start of the End.

27
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,049
First, it's "Back to the Beginning".

28
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,449
There were flashbacks throughout the drama.

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,118
We collected all the flashbacks...

30
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,919
and created new footage.

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,829
It is The Penthouse Youth Theater.

32
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,854
- Youth Theater. - Let's watch.

33
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,729
(The Penthouse Youth Theater)

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,035
(The story of their
youth through flashbacks)

35
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,708
- Back in high school. - Yes.

36
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,439
(Seoul, 1996)

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,575
- It goes back to 1996. - Stop! Stop!

38
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,348
You need to project!

39
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,349
(One father and daughter had an
extraordinary passion for music.)

40
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,345
Don't you know how
important this audition is?

41
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,485
It's an opportunity to sing with
the best opera company in Italy.

42
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,518
They only wanted to see Yoon
Hee, the top student in the school,

43
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,285
but I forced your way in.

44
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,299
I'll practice more, Father.

45
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,458
I can do it.

46
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,669
Are you weeping because I nagged a little?

47
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,998
You know I can't stand seeing chicks cry.

48
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,169
Do it again!

49
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,639
(Everything her father said was
absolute law to Cheon Seo Jin.)

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,069
The trauma to be the top.

51
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,135
(After the audition)

52
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,874
How did it go?

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,045
- Who made it? - This music is playing.

54
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,714
Loser.

55
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,684
You can't beat her even once?

56
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,515
Then...

57
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:33,188
is Yoon Hee going to Italy?

58
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,928
- My. - I can't allow that.

59
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,699
(Yoon Hee with the skill
and Seo Jin with power)

60
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,124
We arranged it to say
Yoon Hee turned them down.

61
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,468
After what I did to get
you in, you almost lost it.

62
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:43,994
What a disgrace.

63
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,738
- I'm sorry. - Let's go.

64
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,109
(Seo Jin couldn't meet
her father's expectations.)

65
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,509
She wants her father
to approve her the most.

66
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,609
(The big day)

67
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,075
(The day of Cheong A Art Festival
to get into Seoul National University)

68
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,778
(Yoon Hee, the top student
shows off what she's capable of.)

69
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,714
- She never makes a mistake. - Yes.

70
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,789
She's the center of S.E.S.

71
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,859
(She finishes her performance
with cheer and applause.)

72
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,558
The highlight of the 25th
Cheong A Art Festival.

73
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,659
The grand prize winner
for the best classical singer.

74
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,094
The Bella Voce Award goes to...

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,494
- Cheon Seo Jin! - My.

76
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,695
(An incomprehensible result is announced.)

77
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,139
What? The grand prize?

78
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,009
- How could you win when you were...
- It's the prelude to war.

79
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,079
Unstable and your voice cracked?

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,148
Did you think you'd always win first place?

81
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,475
This is mine.

82
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,079
- Give it to me. - Let go!

83
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,915
(No one can yield.)

84
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,618
This is where the whole story begins.

85
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:36,648
That's right.

86
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,684
(There's an intense fight over the trophy.)

87
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,425
When I first watched this
drama, this scene was shocking.

88
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,964
(Yoon Hee can barely
get close to the trophy.)

89
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:55,005
No!

90
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,379
The trophy looks so dangerous.

91
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,938
Yes. It's got a pointy end.

92
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,748
I will never let you take this.

93
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:03,049
(That's how their worst
ill-fated relationship begins.)

94
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,645
You pitiful brat.

95
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,214
- What? - The fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin.

96
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,154
You're just a darned thief.

97
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,128
It's scary to watch it again.

98
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,995
(Seo Jin whose pride is hurt ends
up wounding Yoon Hee's neck.)

99
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,664
Look at her face.

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,805
- That reminds me of Eun Byeol. - Right.

101
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,635
It keeps reminding me
of Eun Byeol and Ro Na.

102
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,779
(Only if they had met in an environment...)

103
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,488
(where the competition wasn't so fierce.)

104
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,584
- Seo Jin! - Seo Jin!

105
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,555
- What happened? - Seo Jin!

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,724
The lyrics sound different.

107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,505
(They could've been good friends.)

108
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,308
You can get up now.

109
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,609
(The investigation shows
that Seo Jin fabricated it.)

110
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,245
Fathers all know if they're
sleeping or just pretending.

111
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,284
Fathers always say they're not sleeping.

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,919
Yoon Hee bled a lot from her neck.

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,089
I'm sorry, Father.

114
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,584
- My. - Boy.

115
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,328
Father.

116
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,265
Do you know why I slapped you?

117
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,395
Not because you hurt a brat like her.

118
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,769
It's because you lost to her.

119
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,135
Your father is the director
of the Cheong A Foundation.

120
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,445
And yet, you lost to
a girl with no father...

121
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,748
and made me go and beg the judges...

122
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,049
to give you the Grand Prize.

123
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,188
Her father is turning her into a monster.

124
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,519
I'm sorry, Father. It's my fault.

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,089
This can never happen again.

126
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,659
You must be the best.

127
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,354
Or you don't deserve to take
over Cheong A Foundation.

128
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,325
Okay.

129
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,024
I will be the best.

130
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,469
She ended up hurting her neck...

131
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,698
I can't believe this music is playing.

132
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,534
I feel so bad for her.

133
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,269
She won't be able to sing anymore.

134
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,868
She was the top student
for three years straight.

135
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,078
But now, she's hit rock bottom.

136
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,539
It's Chelsia Chan's song.

137
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,479
Does that mean she won't
be able to go to college?

138
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,645
(They end up walking different paths.)

139
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,849
(Meanwhile in Japan)

140
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,245
Is it Japan?

141
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,484
(Na Ae Gyo, Joo Dan Tae's girlfriend)

142
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,354
(Joo Dan Tae, Na Ae Gyo's boyfriend)

143
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,169
Joo Dan Tae doesn't have much yet.

144
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,769
I'll make sure that you
live like Shim Su Ryeon.

145
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,068
For how much longer do I have to wait?

146
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,969
It won't be long.

147
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,109
If I use Shim Su Ryeon's name right,

148
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,578
we'll become so rich that we could
suffocate under our piles of money.

149
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:47,849
He talks about such a scary plan...

150
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,078
- with such a naive face.
- I'll buy a house in Gangnam,

151
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,019
and build a Joo Dan Tae Village...

152
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,019
on the land where my
mother has passed away on,

153
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,385
and make the whole world kneel before me.

154
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,888
And we'll have children?

155
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,484
Of course.

156
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,959
Just thinking about it makes me so happy.

157
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,265
(They plan to steal other's
life for their happiness.)

158
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:12,195
(Should they be thankful?)

159
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,805
(Is this what love is?)

160
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,409
It's Oh Yoon Hee's song.

161
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,779
(As the first step of his plan, )

162
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,174
- When she was a k-pop singer. - I like it.

163
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,419
(Joo Dan Tae plans a
marriage with Shim Su Ryeon.)

164
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,118
- I'll get this gift-wrapped. - Okay.

165
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,214
(Joo Dan Tae plans a
marriage with Shim Su Ryeon.)

166
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,659
He's marrying Shim Su Ryeon, not Na Ae Gyo.

167
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,115
You're right.

168
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,495
Su Ryeon, what is it? I'm
surprised you called me first.

169
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,424
I feel happy.

170
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,365
Are you coming back for summer break?

171
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,738
My parents are mentioning
our marriage and...

172
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:45,995
Let's call off the marriage.

173
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,164
That's cruel.

174
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,964
What did you just say?

175
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,938
- These are all great songs. - I'm...

176
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,305
getting married soon in the States.

177
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,748
(Dan Tae got dumped.)

178
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:57,515
I'm sorry, Dan Tae.

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,388
Hello?

180
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,919
(However, the plan goes wrong.)

181
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,289
With the wrong method...

182
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,289
Yes, he comes up with a scary plan.

183
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,459
Who says you can?

184
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,089
(He plans one scary incident to marry her.)

185
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,859
Who says you can call it off?

186
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,675
(He plans one scary incident to marry her.)

187
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,529
Is it possible for a human
to become that wicked?

188
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,995
(Several months later in the USA)

189
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,568
(Su Ryeon's spending a pleasant
time with the man she loves.)

190
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,039
She's pregnant.

191
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,709
(Su Ryeon's spending a pleasant
time with the man she loves.)

192
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,935
It's sad since I know
what's going to happen next.

193
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,885
(There are so many
things I should not love)

194
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:50,294
(Dan Tae decides to punish Su
Ryeon for choosing someone else.)

195
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,865
(What upsets him the most is...)

196
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,678
How cruel.

197
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,174
(You who don't love me)

198
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,944
(I didn't ask you to stay by my side)

199
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,358
(You didn't have to call off our marriage.)

200
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,629
The flashbacks show the reasons...

201
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,659
- why they've become monsters. - Yes.

202
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,159
(And)

203
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,629
There must've been a problem
with her brain due to premature birth.

204
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,934
(Su Ryeon ended up giving
premature birth due to shooting.)

205
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,909
It's my fault.

206
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,239
(The moment Dan Tae had
been waiting for has arrived.)

207
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,135
It's all my fault.

208
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,009
Don't blame yourself.

209
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,948
I'll take care of your child now.

210
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,978
(While Su Ryeon became
weak due to shock and sadness...)

211
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,318
Now that I'm watching in order,

212
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,914
I can see the change in their looks.

213
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,259
- It's fun to watch the compilation. - Yes.

214
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,529
(Meanwhile, after high school, )

215
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,595
(Yoon Hee got a job right away.)

216
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,328
It feels like an archive.

217
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:54,864
(Ha Yoon Chul, Yoon Hee's boyfriend)

218
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,799
(She's in love with a
poor medical student.)

219
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,704
I got my salary.

220
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,105
Pay for your lodgings.

221
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,934
- Oh Yoon Hee and Ha Yoon Chul.
- I don't want to.

222
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,009
Stop giving me money.

223
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,348
- What an adorable couple.
- I'm giving it to you to feel good,

224
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,549
so you don't have to feel bad. It's true.

225
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,914
It's not much anyway. Take it.

226
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,715
I'll become a doctor as soon as I can...

227
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,385
and support you.

228
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,318
They haven't met Cheon
Seo Jin yet, have they?

229
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,958
(Even poverty felt romantic to
them because they were in love.)

230
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,485
Cheon Seo Jin sees them now.

231
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:26,759
She gets jealous.

232
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,068
(Their ill-fated relationship
with Cheon Seo Jin begins again.)

233
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,838
(Seo Jin still feels inferior to Yoon Hee.)

234
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,135
Dad, it's me.

235
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,365
About the next Cheong
A Foundation scholarship.

236
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,645
I want to recommend someone
who is studying medicine.

237
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,749
(Yoon Chul became a scholarship student...)

238
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,279
(with Seo Jin's recommendation.)

239
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,345
Holding onto the end
of the night It's no longer

240
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,225
What's going on? Did you get the
Cheong A Foundation scholarship?

241
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:59,698
(Yoon Hee doesn't like it.)

242
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:01,328
Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:04,198
I couldn't refuse to attend
when they gave me a scholarship.

244
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,794
It doesn't mean anything.

245
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,965
Do you call that an excuse?

246
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,978
You being involved with Cheon Seo Jin...

247
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,779
I hate that more than death!

248
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,115
Will you stop talking about Cheon Seo Jin?

249
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,218
Just stop it.

250
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:23,885
I'm sick of it now!

251
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,159
Their relationship falls
apart as Seo Jin intended.

252
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,799
The conflict deepens.

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,064
- That's what Seo Jin wanted. - Yes.

254
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,968
(Love...)

255
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,005
(and reality)

256
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,838
(The young medical student's woe grows.)

257
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,875
- This scene. - Oh, this scene.

258
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,314
- Cheon Seo Jin's really annoying. - Yes.

259
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,678
Stop drinking.

260
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,749
(Yoon Chul has a drink with
Seo Jin out of frustration.)

261
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,154
He drank a lot.

262
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:02,725
That's the old Jinro soju.

263
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,395
- I got too excited. - Darn it.

264
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:09,294
What else am I to do?

265
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,294
Studying must be hard enough.

266
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,105
Why do you want to live with such a burden?

267
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,279
(Yoon Hee sees Yoon
Chul and Seo Jin together.)

268
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,574
Oh, why on earth?

269
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,249
- Why did she have to pass it?
- Especially at that moment.

270
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,774
I will give you...

271
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:31,074
A pair of wings.

272
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:32,259
(Seo Jin suddenly confesses
her feelings to Yoon Chul.)

273
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,228
That sounds so sweet to
a self-supporting student.

274
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,928
I know. In fact, she's
the director's daughter.

275
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,759
(With rain and drinks in between)

276
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,328
How cruel.

277
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,395
(Seo Jin steals Yoon Hee's life again.)

278
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,739
Oh, this is the moment.

279
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,039
(You've left)

280
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,674
(And the rain is falling)

281
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,145
(To someone, it's an end.)

282
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,889
(To someone, it's a start.)

283
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,255
Oh, gosh. Why would you
wrap your arm around her?

284
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,858
Seriously.

285
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:15,294
(Youth and the start of the end)

286
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,194
(Time goes by)

287
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,404
(Over the years)

288
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,274
(A moment to achieve something arrives.)

289
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,779
Today,

290
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,015
(Seo Jin expects an important decision.)

291
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,549
You waited long enough. The foundation...

292
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,485
is yours, Seo Jin.

293
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,358
(She finally becomes the director
she's long been waiting for.)

294
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,659
- Finally. - He finally approves her.

295
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,159
It's what she's been waiting for.

296
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,294
Father.

297
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,355
It was Cheon Seo Jin's goal in life.

298
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,765
A halo.

299
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:54,284
- And fireworks inside the building. - Yes.

300
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,808
- When you're really happy... - Right.

301
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,379
- You're overwhelmed,
- you can't say anything.

302
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,489
But it's hard to describe it.

303
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,848
(The brightest moment
in her life has arrived.)

304
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,385
- It's hard to believe. - Yes.

305
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,485
Now she feels like eating.

306
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,154
(I'm just happy to think about it.)

307
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,024
Today,

308
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:25,265
the most wonderful thing happened to me.

309
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,534
Seo Jin and my husband
are having an affair.

310
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,505
(Soon, her affair with
Dan Tae is revealed.)

311
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,174
We must get divorced.

312
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:34,975
We can't.

313
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,745
Now, the whole Hera Club members know.

314
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,645
We can't stay together.

315
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,789
Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

316
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,855
(Yoon Hee also tries to threaten Seo Jin.)

317
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:46,914
What are you trying to pull?

318
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,784
Everyone already knows
about me and Dan Tae.

319
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,855
That's right.

320
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:56,365
But there's one person who doesn't.

321
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,645
(I don't know yet)

322
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,174
- "Dad." - Dad.

323
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,345
He wishes to appoint
someone else as the director.

324
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,684
(Seo Jin's father dismisses Seo
Jin from the director position.)

325
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,919
No. Father.

326
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,029
(Seo Jin runs to stop her father.)

327
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,088
What a good choice of a song.

328
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,389
Let go.

329
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,154
(She went out of her way
to take the best position.)

330
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,999
(Seo Jin could never lose it.)

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,434
(She confronts her father
who's become an obstacle.)

332
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,239
(Her father's on the verge
of life after the scuffle.)

333
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,279
- Seo Jin. - Grab him. You must grab him.

334
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,444
(Seo Jin turns her back on her father.)

335
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,914
Greed can be very scary.

336
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,458
(She exchanged her father
for the director position.)

337
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,725
You abandoned me...

338
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,198
first, Father.

339
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,365
(Seo Jin ends up killing her father.)

340
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,005
(Meanwhile, Joo Dan Tae)

341
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,848
She's the one...

342
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,989
he talked about the future with.

343
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,985
(He got this far all for Na Ae Gyo.)

344
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
(He ends up killing Na Ae
Gyo with his own hands.)

345
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:34,524
Who do you think she is?

346
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,399
(She was the goal of Dan Tae's life.)

347
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
(Na)

348
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,068
(Ae)

349
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,674
(Gyo)

350
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,044
(She's gone...)

351
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,578
(out of Dan Tae's life for good.)

352
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,174
It's "She's Gone."

353
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,889
(Dan Tae finally realizes the
person he killed was Na Ae Gyo.)

354
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,414
This is like a music video.

355
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,615
So, Na Ae Gyo...

356
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,284
is really dead?

357
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,924
I...

358
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,964
killed...

359
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,295
Na Ae Gyo?

360
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,065
You jerk.

361
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,128
(He cries for the perfect
future he shattered on his own...)

362
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:44,164
(and the sense of loss.)

363
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,668
(Due to the shadow singer incident, )

364
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,934
(Seo Jin faces voting
to be appointed again.)

365
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,519
(But she barely avoids
losing her position.)

366
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,749
She finally protected it.

367
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,648
- It was hard to believe the result.
- I know.

368
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,088
(What protected Seo Jin
was her father's favour.)

369
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,184
What favour?

370
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,954
My first daughter still
has a long way to go.

371
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,494
She is ambitious but lacks in many ways.

372
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:12,994
Support her.

373
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,065
So that she can keep her place as Director.

374
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,635
Yet, she killed her father.

375
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,395
Gosh. It's breaking my heart.

376
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,075
Father...

377
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,545
Why did you do that?

378
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,514
(Her father has gone to a
place he can never come back.)

379
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,929
(Seo Jin wanted her
father to approve her...)

380
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,964
(by winning the highest and best position.)

381
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,138
(Joo Dan Tae dreamed of a
happy future with Na Ae Gyo.)

382
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:57,838
(They both ended up killing the
most precious person in their lives...)

383
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,305
(for them and their lives.)

384
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,914
(And now...)

385
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,484
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

386
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,918
(They've emptied their offices.)

387
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,214
- Bye, bye. - Bye.

388
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,025
Goodbye, Assemblyman.

389
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,095
Bye.

390
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,924
Goodbye, Kang Ma Ri's bathhouse.

391
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:21,598
Bye, Ms. Cheon.

392
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,729
(People who went to prison, Ha Yoon Chul)

393
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,199
(Lee Kyu Jin)

394
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,668
(Ko Sang A)

395
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,269
It was such an unexpected conclusion.

396
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,479
(Joo Dan Tae)

397
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,108
(Oh Yoon Hee)

398
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,179
(People who went back home, Shim Su Ryeon)

399
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,719
(People who went missing,
Jin Bun Hong and Eun Byeol)

400
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,449
(New appearances, Yoo Dong Pil)

401
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,014
(Baek Jun Ki)

402
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,104
Not many of them were
able to keep their places.

403
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,264
(Logan Lee had an explosion accident.)

404
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:00,539
(Find out what they will do in Season 3.)

405
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,769
Their lives are so ironic.

406
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,805
Both Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin...

407
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:06,608
live for someone,

408
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,549
but they end up killing the
person with their own hands.

409
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,749
Like you said, they both
killed someone with their hands.

410
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,378
But there's another thing
they have in common.

411
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,585
Neither of them can do
anything on their own.

412
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,418
All they do is give orders.

413
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,499
The Penthouse would completely
stop without these three people.

414
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,924
You're right. They're at the beck
and call of the main characters.

415
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,929
It wasn't easy to bring all of them here.

416
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,739
I can't believe it. It feels unreal.

417
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,299
You rarely see them in one place.

418
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,368
Exactly.

419
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,868
The three secretaries are here.

420
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,934
- Nice to see you. - Welcome.

421
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,078
This is so exciting. I've
never met them before.

422
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,179
Didn't you shoot any scene
together in Seasons 1 and 2?

423
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,789
- We've never seen them together.
- This is the first time...

424
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,418
we've been on camera together.

425
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,489
The viewers would also think...

426
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,459
this is such a rare opportunity.

427
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,999
Hello, I play...

428
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,668
Secretary Hong, who works for
Logan. My name is Kim Jae Hong.

429
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,969
Hello, I play Secretary Do,

430
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,068
who works for Director Cheon Seo Jin.

431
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,368
My name is Kim Do Hyun.

432
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,805
Hello, I play Secretary Cho,
Joo Dan Tae's right-hand man.

433
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,635
My name is Kim Dong Kyu.

434
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,709
Your eyes are so sparkly.

435
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,045
Your eyes are really shiny.

436
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,545
You look like a little boy with a beard.

437
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,714
It might sound rude,

438
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:25,019
- but the thing is, - I know.

439
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,158
He looks so different
in real life. I'm shocked.

440
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,729
In real life,

441
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,828
- you look so innocent. - You look so kind.

442
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:34,098
I'm still in my 20s too.

443
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,565
- You are? - Yes.

444
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,365
(Shocked)

445
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,535
- What's that reaction? - Your beard...

446
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,969
It's because you beat older guys a lot.

447
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,035
I'm very polite in real life.

448
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,439
- You are. - That's right.

449
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,009
Who's the oldest then?

450
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,244
I was born in 1983.

451
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,449
- Secretary Cho was born...
- I was born in 1994.

452
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,315
- I was born in 1992. - 1992.

453
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,618
But their age doesn't really matter.

454
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,918
What matters in the Penthouse is
who has more money and power.

455
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,058
- That's right. - That's what matters.

456
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,259
Who has the most power then?

457
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,058
In the show, I used to
be in the special forces.

458
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,368
It's something I've come up with.

459
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,098
- It's a secret? - It's a secret.

460
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,664
I'm the only one who knows it.

461
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,464
These two have more powers than I do.

462
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:19,335
I even lose to Oh Yoon Hee and Bae Ro Na.

463
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,308
I get shoved aside by them.

464
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:24,618
Sometimes, I wonder if Secretary
Do has any muscular strength.

465
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,679
"Muscular strength?"

466
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,279
First things first.

467
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,088
We prepared a video that shows
the different work styles you have.

468
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,754
Let's watch it.

469
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,459
Excuse me! You're Logan
Lee's secretary, right?

470
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,724
I'm Logan Lee's secretary.

471
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,199
(Secretary Hong, User of
cutting-edge technology)

472
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,025
So you really are a special agent.

473
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,029
(Using high-tech devices, )

474
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,539
(he prepares thoroughly in advance.)

475
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,035
Everything is set, sir.

476
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,808
(The one who killed Min Seol A is in here.)

477
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,535
(He successfully threatens the
murder suspects of Min Seol A.)

478
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,049
(He uses even more advanced equipment.)

479
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,519
- That's incredible. - The fingerprint.

480
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,749
- It's your biggest accomplishment.
- It was the decisive move.

481
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,365
(He copied Joo Dan Tae's fingerprint.)

482
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,615
You're very proud of it.

483
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,489
That's just... It still makes me proud.

484
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,888
It's your only accomplishment.

485
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,999
(He always remains quiet.)

486
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,398
Oh Yoon Hee was also there on the night...

487
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,014
when the lighting ceremony took place.

488
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,239
(Secretary Hong relies
on high-tech equipment.)

489
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,464
Send this woman out.

490
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,535
- Secretary Do! - He sent you a bouquet.

491
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,939
- What? - Out of the blue?

492
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,155
The mood changed completely.

493
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,848
- Find out whom he met. - Yes, ma'am.

494
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,209
Find where this person is.

495
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,648
- Any other information? - There's none.

496
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,078
I'll make sure to find her
no matter what it takes.

497
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,345
- Find out by all means. - I will, ma'am.

498
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,555
He's like a sunflower.

499
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,790
My gosh.

500
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,914
Are you okay?

501
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:43,459
Why don't you call it a day?

502
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,754
You don't seem so well.

503
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,529
It's suddenly became a romance.

504
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,269
You were with me today...

505
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,929
and after that, you
were in the lesson room.

506
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,095
He's so cool.

507
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,994
You must pull yourself together.

508
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:54,608
(Because of one woman...)

509
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,939
He looks so cool.

510
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,709
This feels completely different.

511
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,009
(He lives another day.)

512
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,204
It's so romantic.

513
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,504
It's amazing.

514
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,578
(Mental and emotional care provider)

515
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,315
(Secretary Do, the man of loyalty)

516
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,174
My goodness.

517
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,549
Secretary Cho, come in. Come in!

518
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,885
- Secretary Cho. - Yes, sir.

519
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,088
(Secretary Cho, the tough guy)

520
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,385
He's the tough guy.

521
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,055
Move your car.

522
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,729
(From moving his boss's car...)

523
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,625
- That's how it all began. - No.

524
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,365
- Did you take care of it? - Yes, sir.

525
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,898
You stay right next to Joo Dan Tae.

526
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,395
(His specialty is violence.)

527
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,474
(He has beaten every man on
the show except for Dan Tae.)

528
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,444
(He is the strongest
fighter in The Penthouse.)

529
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,878
(When it comes to violence, )

530
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,444
(he never disappoints.)

531
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,719
(But apart from that...)

532
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,418
Why are you telling me that now?

533
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:42,818
She hasn't come back to the cottage.

534
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,289
- What is this? - It's the perfect song.

535
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,358
Are you an idiot?

536
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,555
Our stock plummeted today.

537
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,215
They definitely said it was taken.

538
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,525
You moron.

539
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:57,095
If you have the time to say
that, get out and look for her!

540
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,969
Who have you been following, you moron?

541
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,065
My gosh.

542
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,504
- Get out! - Yes, sir.

543
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,108
That moron.

544
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,535
He's so mean.

545
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:07,904
What is this?

546
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,249
I'm sorry, sir.

547
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,214
(Secretary Cho, the violent fighter)

548
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,585
(The story of the hidden heroes begins.)

549
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,088
Even though all three
of you are secretaries,

550
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,328
- your work styles totally differ.
- Absolutely.

551
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:27,499
It was so interesting to see
them next to one another.

552
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,395
A word that's still
ringing in my ears is...

553
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,964
- a "moron". - A "moron".

554
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,499
What did you think?

555
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,709
It's such a shame.

556
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,039
Why do I always mess up
when he can easily beat me?

557
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,179
- Just when he is about to flip...
- I tell him about my mistake.

558
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,645
You're not so tactful, are you?

559
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,345
It's just that I try to
keep my boss updated.

560
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,674
That's a good interpretation.

561
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,818
It's not easy.

562
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:50,585
- Are you athletic? - I'm pretty athletic.

563
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,019
You've beaten...

564
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,989
almost every man on the show...

565
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,489
except for Joo Dan Tae.

566
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,895
Yes, I have.

567
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,568
Will we get to see Secretary Cho...

568
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:03,994
beat Joo Dan Tae in season three?

569
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,039
(Well...)

570
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,598
If not, I'd get upset.

571
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,535
That would be Secretary Cho's last shoot.

572
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:12,739
But you never know what
will happen in The Penthouse.

573
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,279
Secretary Do's video was
so beautiful and touching.

574
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,045
What did you think?

575
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,848
I'm very satisfied.

576
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,989
- I'd love to get the file. - Really?

577
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,244
If I was Cheon Seo Jin,

578
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,818
I might have developed feelings for him.

579
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,789
In the show,

580
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,029
do you have personal
feelings for Cheon Seo Jin?

581
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,929
Not at all.

582
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,799
I blame the music.

583
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,969
It's not my intention at all.

584
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,368
- It totally gave us the wrong idea.
- Definitely.

585
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,365
- I totally got the wrong idea. - I know.

586
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,138
I'm just fond of Ms. Cheon as a person.

587
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:44,535
- You admire her. - Yes.

588
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,808
In the video, when Secretary Hong...

589
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,209
copied the fingerprint,

590
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,848
he looked so proud.

591
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,345
As if you really copied it yourself.

592
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,749
With the fingerprint aside,

593
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,759
there's a scene the viewers think is...

594
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,459
Secretary Hong's biggest accomplishment.

595
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,888
- Okay. - Can you guess what it is?

596
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,598
I have many accomplishments for sure.

597
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,994
Do you realize you sound very arrogant?

598
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,398
- He doesn't even try to be humble.
- He looks so arrogant.

599
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,368
I'd guess it's...

600
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:16,108
my contribution to the romance
between Logan and Shim Su Ryeon.

601
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,138
(Oh...)

602
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:19,105
- It's something else. - Goodness gracious.

603
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,509
It's when you reported to
Logan about Shim Su Ryeon,

604
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,049
- who was disguised as Na Ae Gyo.
- Oh, I see.

605
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,088
Logan told you you
could stop spying on her.

606
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,259
But then you started showing
him pictures slowly, one by one.

607
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,459
That's right.

608
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,224
One of the pictures was of a
handbag, which seems random.

609
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,924
Some suspected Secretary
Hong is a handbag collector.

610
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,934
But I have something shocking to tell you.

611
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:48,068
This should be in the preview.

612
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,209
Let us decide that.

613
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,335
- You're telling us how to edit?
- When we were shooting,

614
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,504
the pictures I showed him were...

615
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,108
(Are you...)

616
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,249
(ready...)

617
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,174
(for a shock?)

618
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,449
just green sheets of paper.

619
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,489
(Shock loading)

620
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,019
They were just green sheets of paper.

621
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,118
Seriously?

622
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,459
(So this is how variety shows work.)

623
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,224
The pictures I was showing him
one by one were sheets of paper.

624
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,264
The pictures were edited
in by the CG team...

625
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,368
- That's so interesting. - afterwards.

626
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:20,434
I had no idea there was
a picture of a handbag...

627
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,904
until I watched the show.

628
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:25,974
Secretary Hong, do you really
think this will be in the preview?

629
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,975
Almost every character
is in prison right now.

630
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,744
Doesn't that mean the
secretaries have bigger roles now?

631
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:37,418
All our bosses are in prison.

632
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,085
And we don't even know
if Secretary Hong's boss...

633
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,885
- is still alive. - Exactly.

634
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,924
But I'm sure they'll try
to find a way to get out.

635
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,628
Secretary Hong seems restless.

636
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,469
- He can't stop fidgeting. - I know.

637
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,694
In seasons 1 and 2,
Secretary Hong didn't appear...

638
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,164
- as much as the other two. - That's right.

639
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,209
If Logan Lee really disappears...

640
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,934
What are you talking about?

641
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,578
- He's going to cry.
- That's how season two ended.

642
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,174
- Don't make him cry. - That's why...

643
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,878
if Logan Lee leaves the show...

644
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,645
My gosh. That's...

645
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,888
(His reaction seems so real.)

646
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:11,885
His reaction feels so genuine.

647
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,719
Please don't say that.

648
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,189
Of course. I really hope we
can see him in season three too.

649
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,158
There's one important question.

650
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,729
Is Secretary Cho...

651
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,194
on Joo Dan Tae's side or
on Yoo Dong Pil's side?

652
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,168
The reason he stays with Joo Dan Tae...

653
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:29,664
might be related to Yoo Dong Pil.

654
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,838
It seems like many
people are taking guesses...

655
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,974
after the last scene where I greeted
Yoo Dong Pil outside the prison.

656
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,979
I'm very curious too.

657
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,049
I want to know...

658
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,449
Secretary Cho's intention
behind working for Joo Dan Tae...

659
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,714
and if he worked for
him from the beginning.

660
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,989
I'm curious.

661
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,585
There's something going on, right?

662
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,189
That's my guess.

663
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,128
About Joo Dan Tae's
trauma related to blood,

664
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:53,128
not many people seem to know.

665
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:55,229
On top of that,

666
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,499
he can't stand dirty shoes.

667
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,568
That's right.

668
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:00,368
If you pay attention to
that part in season three,

669
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,734
I'd be very happy.

670
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,204
I think it's time to ask this question.

671
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:06,535
Earlier...

672
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,378
- What did you do? - He made a heart.

673
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:09,648
Logan.

674
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,479
Instead of just making a heart,

675
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,148
I'll give you a chance...

676
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:15,418
- to say something properly... - Oh my.

677
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,588
- That sounds good. - to Logan.

678
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:19,214
If I get to say something to him...

679
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,058
"Please survive", for example.

680
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,484
Just the thought of Logan makes me tear up.

681
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,799
Seriously?

682
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,994
- He's acting. - No.

683
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,898
I was so shocked. He was really tearing up.

684
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:30,898
- I'm just joking. - He keeps doing this.

685
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,368
Please say something to him.

686
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,598
Logan. Logan?

687
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,939
(To Logan)

688
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,474
I can't figure out...

689
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,808
whether you're alive or dead now.

690
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:44,908
But I really hope you're alive.

691
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,318
If you come back alive and
I get to work for you again,

692
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,388
you can trust the competent Secretary Hong.

693
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,754
I'll take care of everything for you.

694
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:55,959
- Hypothetically speaking... - Okay.

695
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,154
If Logan somehow fails to come back alive,

696
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,328
it seems like Su Ryeon
doesn't have a secretary.

697
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,664
- You'd work for her instead? - So...

698
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:05,964
Ms. Su Ryeon.

699
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,704
I'm a competent man.

700
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,509
- I'm a hard worker.
- He's looking for a job.

701
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,638
He'd even work at Ma Ri Sauna.

702
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,739
(He can even work at Ma Ri Sauna.)

703
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,878
Right? Even if he doesn't get the job...

704
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:18,049
- With a towel around his head.
- We'd love to see you.

705
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,749
It's a women's bathhouse,
so it won't be easy.

706
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,519
I'm ready to do anything.

707
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,148
You should sell banana-flavoured
milk or something.

708
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,888
- Please stop. - I'm sorry.

709
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:26,989
I didn't know when to stop. I apologize.

710
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,388
The more I listen to him,

711
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:29,959
the more it seems like
he's talking to the writer,

712
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,858
- You're right. - Kim Soon Ok.

713
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,098
- Soon Ok, we love you. - We love you.

714
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,568
At the moment, we know nothing
about what's going to happen...

715
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:38,229
in season three.

716
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,138
We don't know how many episodes...

717
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:41,598
these three will appear in...

718
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,464
or if we'll get to see them at all.

719
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,209
- Secretary Hong sighed so deeply.
- Exactly.

720
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,138
Nothing is guaranteed.

721
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,648
So we'd like to give you a
chance to promote yourselves.

722
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,348
I'm suddenly feeling nervous.

723
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:55,749
You can do whatever you want.

724
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,719
- Right. - You can do impressions, dance,

725
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,019
do a monologue...

726
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,328
- A monologue?
- Secretary Hong did mention...

727
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:04,929
that he has many things to show us.

728
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,229
- I have 59.
- But we can't see all 59 of them.

729
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,929
I wasn't planning on doing all 59 of them.

730
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,168
What's the most popular one?

731
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,694
It's the radio show, "Cultwo Show".

732
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,969
The host is Kim Tae Kyun.

733
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,368
This is how he sounds
when he reads a story.

734
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,408
Okay.

735
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:22,049
"Hello. I live in Ilsan..."

736
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,378
- "and work for a company."
- He sounds just like him.

737
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,148
"I'm a 39-year-old man..."

738
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:27,545
Oh, it's a man.

739
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,545
(The details are perfect.)

740
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,885
When it's an older woman, "Hello."

741
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,254
Are you an actor or a comedian?

742
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,088
- I can do anything. - Really?

743
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,199
You're open-minded.

744
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,999
Look how open-minded I am.

745
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,724
He's opening his jacket.

746
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,799
I'm sure you've never seen...

747
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,168
- the next one. - Really?

748
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:49,108
I'll copy Jung Woo
Sung's facial expression.

749
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:50,709
Jung Woo Sung's facial expression.

750
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,108
It's just an impression.

751
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,209
I'm not saying I look like him.

752
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,348
The eyes are important.

753
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,479
(Jung Woo Sung loading)

754
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,714
(Complete)

755
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,549
(Oh!)

756
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,949
It's his smile.

757
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,088
- I've seen it.
- He looks exactly like him.

758
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,918
- I know what it is. - My gosh.

759
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,484
Goodness.

760
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,358
- I know what it is. - That's incredible.

761
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,628
- That's hilarious.
- You look exactly like him.

762
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:11,689
It's incredible, right?

763
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,799
Once you put on that expression,

764
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,328
you look just like Jung Woo Sung.

765
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,898
- Exactly. - This feels weird.

766
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,969
His eyes and nose look
exactly like Jung Woo Sung's.

767
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,838
I just gave it a try,

768
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,239
and many seemed to love it.

769
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,368
You look just like him.

770
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,408
You're funnier than most comedians.

771
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:26,709
He's so good.

772
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,338
I should work harder.

773
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,749
Would you like to wrap
things up nicely here...

774
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,318
or do you want to try some more?

775
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,519
It's been going well so far.

776
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,749
Hwang Je Seong has already done this.

777
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,154
It's Lee Kyoung Young
singing "Any Song" by ZICO.

778
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,289
There's this gesture he always does.

779
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,865
(He starts with his typical gesture.)

780
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,424
Why are you all so down?

781
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,459
(Hilarious)

782
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,454
What's the problem? Say something

783
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,598
- That's so funny. - He's really good.

784
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,838
- That's hilarious.
- Let me try Lee Kyoung Young...

785
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,068
playing Jung Woo Sung's role...

786
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:58,269
in "A Moment to Remember".

787
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,308
That sounds so funny.

788
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:00,934
That's an interesting twist.

789
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,305
If you drink this, we go out together.

790
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:07,244
You don't want to drink it?

791
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,315
I feel so lonely.

792
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,614
(Hilarious)

793
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,315
- That's it. - My gosh.

794
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,958
- Oh, my. - Nice job.

795
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,559
He's trying harder toward the end.

796
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,628
- I think that's it.
- That sounds good. It was perfect.

797
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,395
(Secretary Hong's
self-promotion ended successfully.)

798
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:24,029
- It's Secretary Do's turn now. - But...

799
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,938
- Secretary Do... - This is not good.

800
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,268
You must feel a little pressured.

801
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,108
We had actually decided on the order.

802
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,369
What was the original order?

803
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,009
- He was supposed to go last.
- He was supposed to go last.

804
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,538
It's our mistake. We apologize.

805
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,545
Do better next time.

806
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,049
- Do better next time. - He's scolding us.

807
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,179
My goodness.

808
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,179
Between you two, who wants to go first?

809
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,414
I actually...

810
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,719
was going to do impressions...

811
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,958
- of the cast of The Penthouse.
- That sounds great.

812
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,288
But after seeing what
he did, I don't dare...

813
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,398
- Don't be like that. - Come on.

814
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,699
Why are you all so down?

815
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,199
Stop it.

816
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,969
Then I'll mix it with beatboxing.

817
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,438
- Okay. - That sounds great.

818
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,695
I'll start with Joo Dan Tae,

819
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,768
and move on to Cheon Seo Jin,

820
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,634
and to Ma Doo Ki.

821
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,375
Sure.

822
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,574
I'm so nervous.

823
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,155
(So far so good)

824
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,954
(Beatboxing)

825
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:26,955
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] SBS 'The Penthouse S03 Special'</font>
<font color="#ff8080">"Hidden Room - The Start of the End"</font>
<font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

826
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,425
What on earth did she see?

827
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,764
(His impression of Joo
Dan Tae is a success.)

828
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,434
Oh Yoon Hee?

829
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,804
Is it really you?

830
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,509
Oh Yoon Hee?

831
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,579
(What am I hearing?)

832
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,445
(Back to beatboxing)

833
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,018
Bae Ro Na.

834
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,748
- Oh, my. - He sounds just like him.

835
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:50,449
You're so cheeky.

836
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,284
But I'm your homeroom teacher.

837
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:58,228
- That was amazing. - My gosh.

838
00:35:58,229 --> 00:36:00,159
What was that in the middle?

839
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,695
"Oh Yoon Hee?"

840
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,824
- "Is it really you?" - "Is it really you?"

841
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,768
I can imagine him practicing this at home.

842
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:09,438
- I do. - He practices beatboxing.

843
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,835
Secretary Cho, will you be okay?

844
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,179
You must feel so pressured.

845
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,648
I don't have many things...

846
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:18,509
- to show you. - Okay.

847
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,619
But I wanted to do my best.

848
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,949
So I prepared "Rollin'",
which is so popular these days.

849
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,018
(Can he be this cute?)

850
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,719
"Rollin'"? That sounds awesome.

851
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,784
(Can he be this sexy?)

852
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,159
(The pressure is driving him crazy.)

853
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,559
I can't imagine Secretary
Cho dancing to "Rollin'".

854
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,695
(How will the boy with a
beard dance to "Rollin'"?)

855
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,898
I'll just do my best.

856
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,038
- Please enjoy it. - Of course.

857
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,695
I can't wait to see it.

858
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,474
(His facial expression
changes immediately.)

859
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:51,145
What is this?

860
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,645
Look at his face.

861
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,545
What is going on here?

862
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,215
Oh, my.

863
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,014
(He doesn't miss any move.)

864
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,889
(Are you watching?)

865
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,554
(This is the tough guy's ray dance.)

866
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:10,969
(He throws in some fancy steps.)

867
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,335
- Look at that. - Look at his steps.

868
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,804
(He finishes up with hearts.)

869
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:20,875
He prepared a lot.

870
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:22,949
Once the song started...

871
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,279
He changed completely.

872
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,014
He's a great dancer.

873
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,719
What do I do?

874
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,088
We've had so many funny moments today.

875
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,949
So many variety shows
will want Secretary Hong...

876
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,119
- as their guest. - Of course.

877
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,259
- I wish we had more time.
- You'll be seeing Do Yeon a lot.

878
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,889
Why is he doing this?

879
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,728
I'm old.

880
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:41,559
Don't sound so sad.

881
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,125
Everyone gets old.

882
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:44,199
(Laughing)

883
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,768
He keeps talking about his age.

884
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,398
You're still so young.

885
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,699
- Okay. - Right?

886
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,139
I wish we could talk to them a bit more.

887
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,938
- It was so fun. - Time went so fast.

888
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,279
Please say something to the viewers.

889
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,009
I'm so happy we got a chance...

890
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,378
to meet our viewers outside the show.

891
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,549
I hope you continue to enjoy our show.

892
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,188
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you for your support.

893
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:06,989
Show us Jung Woo Sung's smile again.

894
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,219
(Jung Woo Sung's smile one last time)

895
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,128
It's addictive. It's dangerous.

896
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:11,989
- I can't get enough. - Me neither.

897
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,059
We'll look forward...

898
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,594
to seeing the three of
them in season three.

899
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,034
Hi.

900
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:28,505
(The Penthouse kids played a
big part in the show's popularity.)

901
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:34,744
(Here they come!)

902
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,114
(I'll make your dream
come true on your behalf.)

903
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,784
(A natural talent)

904
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:48,625
(She patiently puts up with bullying.)

905
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:54,735
(But Bae Ro Na is branded
as a murderer's daughter.)

906
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,105
(Apart from his mean
personality, he is absolutely perfect.)

907
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:06,375
(He changes when he
meets his first love, Ro Na.)

908
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:13,454
(Joo Seok Hoon rebels against his father.)

909
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:20,255
(She inherited her mother's
obsession with first place.)

910
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,534
(Her inadequacy leads
to a mental breakdown.)

911
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,878
(Ha Eun Byeol, who is forever number two, )

912
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:36,675
(is determined to be number one.)

913
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:41,175
Welcome to your nightmare.

914
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,715
(The queen of Cheong A Arts
High School can't stand poverty.)

915
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:53,094
(On the inside, the soft-hearted
girl misses her mom.)

916
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,395
How dare you?

917
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:01,434
(Joo Seok Kyung, the troublemaker
who is both strong and weak)

918
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,969
You have to eat very balanced meals.

919
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:09,974
(The immature boy whose
parents are his biggest strength)

920
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:17,284
(With his credentials gone, Min
Hyuk starts caring about his parents.)

921
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,884
(The hidden story of the
Penthouse kids begins now.)

922
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,358
They're finally here.

923
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,668
If only I could share...

924
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:33,264
- my optic nerves with our viewers.
- I know.

925
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,869
Isn't it incredible?

926
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,639
- They should see them in real life.
- Exactly.

927
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,275
They look even better in real life.

928
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,779
Each of them...

929
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,708
really glows.

930
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,279
It feels different from
seeing them in the show.

931
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,978
None of you seem to deny it.

932
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:48,314
No one says, "That's not true."

933
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,745
- I know. - "That's not true."

934
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,288
- They all love themselves so much.
- The secretaries...

935
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:53,489
are watching.

936
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,559
By the way,

937
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,128
- you may wonder where Jenny is.
- She's missing.

938
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:58,659
She has an important performance...

939
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,858
at her school, not Cheong
A Arts High School,

940
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,998
but the one in real life.

941
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,168
That's why she couldn't make it.

942
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:06,838
I'm sure the five of
you can make up for it.

943
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,739
The Penthouse is extremely popular.

944
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,309
Has anything changed
since the show started airing?

945
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,538
Many things have changed.

946
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,378
But since we have to wear masks,

947
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:19,549
- I can't notice much of it.
- It's the pandemic's fault.

948
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,179
Did you know the show would be such a hit?

949
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,818
This was my first show,

950
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:25,889
so I couldn't really make any predictions.

951
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,119
When I read the script,

952
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,188
I was just shocked...

953
00:41:30,189 --> 00:41:31,259
by Seok Kyung's personality.

954
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,398
Was this your début show?

955
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,728
Almost.

956
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:35,994
(It was her first main role.)

957
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,099
What are you going to do now?

958
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,128
(What?)

959
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,438
What do you mean?

960
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,969
- What I mean is...
- Because it became such a hit?

961
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,568
Her début show became such a big hit.

962
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:45,909
What about you, Min Hyuk?

963
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,478
I knew it was going to be a hit...

964
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:49,449
as soon as I read the script.

965
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,248
Since the story is so intense,

966
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:53,349
I thought it could add a little fun...

967
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,918
to the dull everyday life.

968
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,715
He sounds like a professor.

969
00:41:57,189 --> 00:41:58,619
"The dull everyday life..."

970
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,818
- "The dull everyday life..."
- He sounds like a professor.

971
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,659
But he's always like that.

972
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,059
He's extremely calm in real life.

973
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,255
He's very mature.

974
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,155
- Thank you. - He's a genius.

975
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,799
There's something I really want to ask you.

976
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,438
Your parents must be so proud.

977
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,099
The people around them...

978
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,509
talk a lot about the show. It
makes my parents very proud.

979
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,579
I think I should try to be
more careful and humble...

980
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,838
at a time like this.

981
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,204
She smiles a lot in real life.

982
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,119
- She looks completely different.
- In the show, she glares at people.

983
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,679
Even before the cameras started rolling,

984
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,344
she was smiling the whole time.

985
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,719
I wondered if she was seeing things.

986
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,788
(Everyone claps their hands.)

987
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:35,989
She's so lovely.

988
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,329
You do smile a lot.

989
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,199
The Hidden Room crew analysed...

990
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,728
every scene of the Penthouse kids...

991
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,929
in seasons 1 and 2.

992
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,438
Surprisingly,

993
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,799
one of them...

994
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,838
turned out to be...

995
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,409
extremely materialistic and greedy.

996
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,139
Can you guess who it is?

997
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,179
(Seok Kyung raises her hand.)

998
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,449
Seok Kyung?

999
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,509
- No? I think it's me. - Seok Kyung.

1000
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,518
If it's among us.

1001
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,748
They think it's Seok Kyung.

1002
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,148
- This is so real. - It's not me?

1003
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:05,549
I heard that you didn't
see the script for today.

1004
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,619
- That's right. - That's right.

1005
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,188
So they don't know what we're going to do?

1006
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,588
- They don't. - We don't.

1007
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:10,829
- We have no idea. - We don't know.

1008
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,929
All of you are going to
dance to "Rollin'" later.

1009
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,829
- No! We didn't hear about that. - No!

1010
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,768
(Do Yeon's scheme fails.)

1011
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:18,864
I failed.

1012
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,268
Please tell us.

1013
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:22,299
Let's see if it's really Seok Kyung.

1014
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,809
The typical materialist turns out to be...

1015
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,179
Bae Ro Na.

1016
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,639
- What? - Why?

1017
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,949
- It's Ro Na. - Are you greedy?

1018
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,474
Here's the proof. Let's watch it.

1019
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,918
(Ro Na is full of anger.)

1020
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:38,389
- She's very angry. - She's angry.

1021
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,054
(Fierce)

1022
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,059
(She often rebels against her mom.)

1023
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,425
That's right.

1024
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:45,429
It's from season one.

1025
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,755
(The only way to make her laugh is...)

1026
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,224
(I have presents for you.)

1027
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,639
- She's so cute. - She's so cute.

1028
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,768
How did you know?

1029
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,664
She can't stop smiling.

1030
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,534
(Excited)

1031
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,878
(She automatically smiles.)

1032
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:03,105
She couldn't be happier.

1033
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,449
(She also gets irritated easily.)

1034
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,945
She gets irritated easily.

1035
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,219
She has mood swings.

1036
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,884
(But presents can calm her down.)

1037
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,344
That's right.

1038
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,119
It's very easy to calm her down.

1039
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,188
You're right.

1040
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:17,985
Mom, I'm not dreaming, am I?

1041
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,494
I'm proud of you.

1042
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,135
(How could you call yourself human?)

1043
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,724
You're disgusting! You creep me out!

1044
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:25,498
- Wait a second. - She looks so happy.

1045
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,038
You are materialistic.

1046
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,434
The editing is so mean.

1047
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,409
Even the song sounds so happy.

1048
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,074
(Her mom used to creep her out.)

1049
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,375
Yes, we're going to live here.

1050
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:37,949
(Bae Ro Na's capitalistic smile)

1051
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,549
- That was funny. - It was true.

1052
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,418
The editing is so mean.

1053
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:43,989
(It's the result of our analysis.)

1054
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,018
Can you relate to your character?

1055
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,429
Since this is the third season...

1056
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,889
and we've been shooting for a long time,

1057
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,699
it's easier to relate to Ro Na...

1058
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,594
than my previous characters.

1059
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:56,668
(Nodding)

1060
00:44:56,669 --> 00:44:58,529
Seok Hoon seems to be immersed in his role.

1061
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,235
(Is he still immersed in his role?)

1062
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,838
Say something.

1063
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,108
- He's even dressed in black.
- He's dressed in black.

1064
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:06,038
You could've worn a helmet too.

1065
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,509
We were told to wear...

1066
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,079
- bright, casual clothes. - That's right.

1067
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,049
That's why we're wearing
these colourful clothes.

1068
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,318
And he showed up in a black suit.

1069
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,349
I didn't hear that.

1070
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,684
Did you come straight from
the Baeksang Arts Awards?

1071
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,485
Exactly.

1072
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:21,989
How do you get into the role?

1073
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,688
You must be more cheerful in real life.

1074
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:25,784
I am.

1075
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:27,554
That's it?

1076
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,494
I didn't expect that.

1077
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,199
- I see. - Okay.

1078
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,139
Another reason for the
popularity of The Penthouse...

1079
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,869
is the perfect acting.

1080
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,168
Their excellent acting
definitely contributed...

1081
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:39,978
to the show's popularity.

1082
00:45:39,979 --> 00:45:42,708
But the acting of one of
them was pretty embarrassing.

1083
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:44,074
Can you guess who it is?

1084
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
Is it me?

1085
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:46,679
I was wondering if it was me.

1086
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,244
Could it be literal?

1087
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:51,134
(Seok Kyung lifts her foot.)

1088
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,249
It must be me.

1089
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,858
- We have proof. - We do.

1090
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:55,715
Let's watch it together.

1091
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:58,989
She used her feet a lot.

1092
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,494
3, 2, 1, 5.2, 1, 3, 2.

1093
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,068
(That's embarrassing.)

1094
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:05,628
That's so embarrassing.

1095
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,699
I'm wiggling my toes.

1096
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,038
(I do everything with my feet.)

1097
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,779
- She keeps using her feet.
- She's so charismatic.

1098
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,438
- Look at that. - She's so cute.

1099
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,509
(She moves her foot up and down.)

1100
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,510
She looks so cute.

1101
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:18,049
(This is how I act with my foot.)

1102
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,779
With the background
music, she looks so cute.

1103
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,945
(Watch this.)

1104
00:46:22,419 --> 00:46:26,059
(Here comes the ultimate foot acting.)

1105
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,995
It must have been so
hard to shoot that scene.

1106
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,688
(This time, she acts with her entire body.)

1107
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:32,795
My goodness.

1108
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,099
- That scene... - That was really...

1109
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,364
It was really hard.

1110
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,724
(Stop putting on an
act. You can't fool me.)

1111
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Oh, my.

1112
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:43,264
(Seok Kyung's foot
acting gets a thumbs-up.)

1113
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:45,634
It ended with a thumbs-up.

1114
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,978
She can even express
emotions using her feet.

1115
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:50,179
- I know. - It's incredible.

1116
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,219
Did you try to pay more
attention to your feet?

1117
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,219
It was the director's idea.

1118
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,418
So it wasn't in the script...

1119
00:46:57,419 --> 00:46:58,918
but the director ordered you to do it?

1120
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:01,518
Yes. He'd say, "How
about you put your feet up?"

1121
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,059
He wanted me to look more rebellious.

1122
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,199
At first, I was wearing socks.

1123
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,659
And he wanted me to take them off.

1124
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,498
So I put nail polish on my
toes a couple of days before.

1125
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:14,369
The scene where you
fall in the water looks hard.

1126
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,139
It was very cold.

1127
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,509
After I fell in the water,

1128
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,375
Young Dae came in to save me.

1129
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,878
He came in floundering.

1130
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,074
And I slipped.

1131
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,574
- I ended up falling too. - That's right.

1132
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,449
She said, "You should go out."

1133
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,148
Seok Hoon is finally
getting out of his role.

1134
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:31,688
When season three starts,

1135
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:33,619
I'll pay extra attention
to Seok Kyung's feet.

1136
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,858
- Let's see if there's more.
- Did I shoot more?

1137
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:38,029
Can you act with your feet right now?

1138
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,159
Please express your emotion right now.

1139
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,659
- Well... - Show us how you feel.

1140
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,969
No. I don't know what to do.

1141
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,970
(Flapping)

1142
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:45,029
I did it.

1143
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,838
- I did it. - You did it?

1144
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:48,139
I'm done.

1145
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,239
Good job.

1146
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,268
- By the way, Do Yeon, - Yes?

1147
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:52,338
We should be careful with
what we do and say today.

1148
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:54,938
- You're right.
- There's a secret agent here.

1149
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:58,455
The secret agent is watching
us even at this moment.

1150
00:47:58,456 --> 00:48:01,651
Can you guess who it is?

1151
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:11,732
Can you guess who the secret agent is?

1152
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:13,033
- Not really. - I think this might be hard.

1153
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:14,569
- Of the five of you... - I think...

1154
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:15,672
Maybe not?

1155
00:48:15,673 --> 00:48:17,073
- The secret agent? - I'm not sure.

1156
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:19,468
The secret agent is...

1157
00:48:19,844 --> 00:48:21,239
- Joo Seok Hoon. - I knew it.

1158
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,483
- I got it wrong again.
- Oh, because I'm always watching.

1159
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,878
Every time I cause trouble,
he comes running over,

1160
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:27,312
and screams,

1161
00:48:27,313 --> 00:48:28,413
"Joo Seok Kyung!"

1162
00:48:28,414 --> 00:48:30,152
- You shocked the audio director.
- I'm sorry.

1163
00:48:30,153 --> 00:48:31,619
He thought you were quiet.

1164
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,623
(Seok Hoon said something
for the first time in 10 minutes.)

1165
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:34,752
I'm sorry.

1166
00:48:34,753 --> 00:48:38,123
Let's look at Joo Seok Hoon's
true nature for ourselves,

1167
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,229
after he's infiltrated The Penthouse.

1168
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:42,962
(Secret Agent, The Hoon Identity)

1169
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:45,403
(Focused)

1170
00:48:45,404 --> 00:48:49,238
(Specialty 1, Boxing)

1171
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:51,572
(Specialty 2, Stakeouts
and shadowing people)

1172
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:53,338
That's right, that happened.

1173
00:48:53,374 --> 00:48:54,908
He was following Ro Na.

1174
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:57,782
(Specialty 3, Monitoring the enemy)

1175
00:48:57,783 --> 00:48:59,182
- He's right there. - That's right.

1176
00:48:59,183 --> 00:49:00,612
- Isn't it like "Where's Willy?"
- This is too funny.

1177
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:01,848
That's so scary.

1178
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:03,622
Watching from above.

1179
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:04,753
(Embarrassed)

1180
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:07,352
(Specialty 4, Wiretapping)

1181
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:08,688
Wiretapping.

1182
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:11,858
- Isn't that when you saw Ro Na?
- Yes, it is.

1183
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:13,693
(He is a team leader who is
smart and makes the right decision.)

1184
00:49:13,694 --> 00:49:15,432
Leave the group chat and block this ID.

1185
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:17,599
And don't tell anyone.

1186
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:19,973
That's right.

1187
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:21,202
This part was so dashing.

1188
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:23,003
(He can carry out his mission
perfectly no matter what.)

1189
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:25,402
Min Seol A died in Hera Palace.

1190
00:49:25,403 --> 00:49:27,143
(Interrogating the suspect)

1191
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:28,212
Isn't that right?

1192
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:29,742
(Interrogating the suspect)

1193
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:31,039
Are your memories back?

1194
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:33,553
Why do I find that so cute?

1195
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,482
(Hostage rescue)

1196
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:36,718
Hostage rescue.

1197
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:41,119
(He figured out the
escape route in advance.)

1198
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:45,058
(He carries out the rescue
secretly and quickly.)

1199
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:49,503
(The last order from headquarters)

1200
00:49:49,504 --> 00:49:50,663
Yes, it's me.

1201
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:52,033
(The last order from headquarters)

1202
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,229
Tonight?

1203
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:54,572
He really seems like a secret agent here.

1204
00:49:54,573 --> 00:49:55,968
I'll wait for you.

1205
00:49:58,304 --> 00:49:59,413
- What's with the song? - No way.

1206
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,909
(His last mission)

1207
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:04,283
(The quiet agent who resolutely
carries out his missions)

1208
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:06,313
He's like a cartoon character.

1209
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:08,909
(The Hoon Identity, Season 3, coming soon)

1210
00:50:09,013 --> 00:50:10,148
My goodness.

1211
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,593
- He wasn't looking for me, I guess.
- The Hoon Identity.

1212
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:13,693
What did you think?

1213
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:17,463
First of all, they edited it so
well, which I was happy to see.

1214
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:18,689
(Could this be?)

1215
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:21,129
It's like he's giving a
speech at an award ceremony.

1216
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:23,732
I think you've still got your
head in the Baeksang Arts Awards?

1217
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:26,802
(We'll hear the rest of your
speech at the SBS Drama Awards.)

1218
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:28,533
I'm sure you noticed this too
as we were watching the clip,

1219
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:31,599
but Seok Hoon acts with his eyes so well.

1220
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:33,509
(It can't be, can it?)

1221
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:35,368
- To Do Yeon, could you... - No, no.

1222
00:50:35,513 --> 00:50:37,112
(He's the only one having
trouble laughing now.)

1223
00:50:37,113 --> 00:50:40,852
- You don't have to.
- The way you look at Ro Na.

1224
00:50:40,853 --> 00:50:42,148
Just do it for us once.

1225
00:50:42,654 --> 00:50:44,849
Just pretend it's Ro Na
20 years into the future.

1226
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:46,918
A lot happened to Ro Na,

1227
00:50:47,023 --> 00:50:48,689
and she suffered a lot over the years.

1228
00:50:49,053 --> 00:50:51,223
1, 2...

1229
00:50:51,224 --> 00:50:52,759
(Fidgeting)

1230
00:50:53,863 --> 00:50:55,033
Stop fidgeting.

1231
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:56,362
(Even the ones watching
feel nervous about it.)

1232
00:50:56,363 --> 00:50:59,172
Now, 1, 2, 3.

1233
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:01,229
(No...)

1234
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:02,473
- Three. - No...

1235
00:51:02,474 --> 00:51:03,873
(Interpretation, "This
is too embarrassing.")

1236
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:05,039
- Three. - No...

1237
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:07,539
(Do Yeon is confused.)

1238
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:08,944
Do Yeon...

1239
00:51:08,945 --> 00:51:11,443
- Her heart was racing just now.
- No, I'm sorry.

1240
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,283
(Do Yeon's heart was racing
within 1 second of gazing.)

1241
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:14,608
I'm sorry, Do Yeon.

1242
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:16,379
- As for Min Hyuk, - Yes?

1243
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,822
After watching this clip,
you'll be able to participate...

1244
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:22,589
in season three not as an
actor, but in a different role.

1245
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:25,289
Is it a camera director?

1246
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:27,488
That's right, the cameras.

1247
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:31,059
Let's confirm if they're
right or wrong in the video.

1248
00:51:32,103 --> 00:51:34,928
(Min Hyuk is in charge of
filming, anytime, anywhere.)

1249
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,243
(That includes dynamic sports filming, )

1250
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:39,368
(with live moving shots, )

1251
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,409
(and appropriate close-ups.)

1252
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:42,843
That's right.

1253
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:44,843
(He even follows characters'
movements properly.)

1254
00:51:44,844 --> 00:51:47,148
- Even there. - Even in that tight space.

1255
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:49,448
Quickly, do it now.

1256
00:51:49,684 --> 00:51:51,319
Filming sideways.

1257
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:53,422
- Drink up, quickly. - Drink it.

1258
00:51:53,423 --> 00:51:54,753
(He can turn horizontally
filmed videos into vertical ones.)

1259
00:51:54,754 --> 00:51:55,958
That's so true.

1260
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:57,918
They filmed this well.

1261
00:51:57,964 --> 00:51:59,159
What?

1262
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:01,958
I'm not the old Min Hyuk.

1263
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:03,503
(Call me Director Lee from now on.)

1264
00:52:03,504 --> 00:52:05,828
- Director Lee. - Wow.

1265
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:07,768
Director Lee.

1266
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:12,142
The current camera director
of The Penthouse is nervous.

1267
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:13,339
(Chuckling)

1268
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:16,279
I'm sure he really is, right?

1269
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:20,048
I know I've said it but
I'm not sure about that.

1270
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:22,649
He's breaking out in a
cold sweat, even now.

1271
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,548
- So he is nervous after all. - Yes.

1272
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:26,222
I'm really curious about one weird detail.

1273
00:52:26,223 --> 00:52:28,222
Do you film with your own
phone, or with a set prop?

1274
00:52:28,223 --> 00:52:29,822
As in, is he really filming?

1275
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,123
Yes, I'm really curious about that.

1276
00:52:31,124 --> 00:52:32,293
I film with a prop.

1277
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:33,392
But you're really filming?

1278
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:36,558
Yes, I think they do that so
they can really use the footage.

1279
00:52:36,804 --> 00:52:39,329
I end up focusing more on
filming than I do on acting.

1280
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:40,803
Are your skills getting better?

1281
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:44,798
Yes, because I keep wanting
to make everything look good.

1282
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:47,608
I'll adjust the angles. I
filmed a lot for Jenny, actually.

1283
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:50,079
I'd say, "Your right side looks pretty."

1284
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:52,209
- Wow. - That's what I'd end up doing.

1285
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:54,178
You smell like a pro.

1286
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:57,853
- At the last interview, Min Hyuk...
- I got a lot of criticism.

1287
00:52:57,854 --> 00:53:00,092
You said that it was hard
for you as a result, right?

1288
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,222
After the last special episode aired...

1289
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:05,159
(After The Penthouse 2 Hidden
Room, The Unfinished Story aired.)

1290
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:09,058
I got a lot of people
showing me their support.

1291
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:10,902
- That means you acted well.
- That's right.

1292
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:12,262
Eun Byeol, did you
experience anything similar?

1293
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:15,572
I had a lot of scenes
where I picked on others,

1294
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:17,603
so I also got a lot of
criticism for that as well.

1295
00:53:17,604 --> 00:53:20,709
Since I also tend to flip
out on my own, chaotically,

1296
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:22,839
I think some viewers...

1297
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,678
didn't like that side of me.

1298
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,079
How do you feel when you see that?

1299
00:53:29,283 --> 00:53:30,449
Are you disappointed?

1300
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:34,918
- I'm disappointed, but...
- Are you smiling at negative posts?

1301
00:53:36,494 --> 00:53:39,688
Now we just have Eun Byeol left,

1302
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:44,428
but it turns out she has
an incredible alter ego.

1303
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:47,032
Let's find out Eun Byeol's
alter ego in this video.

1304
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:48,168
Alter ego?

1305
00:53:48,403 --> 00:53:49,743
(Ha Eun Byeol is dying.)

1306
00:53:49,744 --> 00:53:50,938
That's scary.

1307
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:52,938
I look like a zombie.

1308
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:54,443
Oh, gosh.

1309
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:57,508
(In order to save her...)

1310
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:58,843
Oh, no.

1311
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:01,313
(Dr. Ha decides to take a gamble.)

1312
00:54:01,314 --> 00:54:02,553
That was shocking.

1313
00:54:02,554 --> 00:54:05,418
(He gives Eun Byeol a super serum, but...)

1314
00:54:05,884 --> 00:54:06,993
Is she a zombie?

1315
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,589
- A zombie. - Eun Byeol!

1316
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:11,693
What's happening? Did something go wrong?

1317
00:54:11,694 --> 00:54:12,933
Do something!

1318
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:15,758
(The revived Eun Byeol
experiences strange events.)

1319
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:21,928
(An inexplicable ringing in her ears)

1320
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:24,599
(Strange images)

1321
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:32,443
(Even ghost sightings)

1322
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:33,712
That sounds like it would be so miserable.

1323
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,048
It's all mine.

1324
00:54:35,713 --> 00:54:37,479
She is sick and tired of ghosts now.

1325
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:42,322
(Eun Byeol decides to become an exorcist.)

1326
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:43,488
So suddenly?

1327
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:45,262
Start over with your breathing.

1328
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:46,293
(Her training began.)

1329
00:54:46,294 --> 00:54:48,069
- She's training to be an exorcist? - Yes.

1330
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:50,332
(As her exorcism training
starts to come to a close...)

1331
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,529
Contract your abs more.

1332
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:56,498
(She even gains a legendary
weapon in the exorcism world.)

1333
00:54:57,203 --> 00:54:58,803
From the exorcism world.

1334
00:54:58,804 --> 00:55:00,859
(Exorcist Eun Byeol
maxes out her battle points.)

1335
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:02,572
(She heads to Hera Palace...)

1336
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:03,883
Here we go with the music.

1337
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,709
(where ghosts have been spotted.)

1338
00:55:07,254 --> 00:55:08,353
There.

1339
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:09,423
But...

1340
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:12,849
(But she's overwhelmed by
the sight of Ro Na's ghost.)

1341
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:16,722
(Scared to death by the
ghost's singing attack.)

1342
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:18,558
Ro Na is right there!

1343
00:55:19,064 --> 00:55:21,229
- The attack? - It's a musical attack.

1344
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:24,733
(She tries wielding the legendary weapon.)

1345
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:26,433
Oh, my gosh.

1346
00:55:26,434 --> 00:55:27,503
(It's stronger than she thought.)

1347
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:29,029
This was honestly a bit scary.

1348
00:55:29,403 --> 00:55:32,368
Oh, no. No!

1349
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:33,443
Eun Byeol!

1350
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:34,639
This is so funny.

1351
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:36,068
- Here. - Wow.

1352
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:37,808
No.

1353
00:55:37,843 --> 00:55:39,043
Eun Byeol.

1354
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,548
(Ro Na's ghost finally disappears.)

1355
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:43,918
(Eun Byeol won her meaningful
victory with her own courage.)

1356
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,253
(The protector of Hera Palace)

1357
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:48,022
I'm amazed they
managed to edit it this way.

1358
00:55:48,023 --> 00:55:49,322
Wow.

1359
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:53,188
(She's the exorcist, Ha Eun Byeol.)

1360
00:55:54,294 --> 00:55:56,058
She's an exorcist now.

1361
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:59,233
We saw this in the clip too,

1362
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,733
but you had an unusually
large number of ghost sightings.

1363
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,572
Wasn't that hard to film?

1364
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:07,373
When we film, I see the
real Ro Na, the person,

1365
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:10,983
but when it airs, there are
bats flying around everywhere.

1366
00:56:10,984 --> 00:56:13,253
- Are you two separated?
- We start out in the same area,

1367
00:56:13,254 --> 00:56:14,452
and Eun Byeol attacks the air,

1368
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:17,349
and then I'll go in with a green screen,

1369
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,878
and fly around.

1370
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:20,794
(Why are you laughing?
It is a green screen.)

1371
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,389
She's so cute.

1372
00:56:22,523 --> 00:56:23,863
Do you practice any individual skills?

1373
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:27,159
- Eun Byeol has a ton of them.
- No, I'm not.

1374
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:30,199
She'll show them to us while we're on set.

1375
00:56:30,964 --> 00:56:32,703
- Really? - This is a set too.

1376
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:33,973
(Show us.)

1377
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,743
I'll do Krusty Krab from
"Spongebob Squarepants."

1378
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:38,744
(It's already funny
before she even tries it.)

1379
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:40,839
That's so funny. Krusty Krab.

1380
00:56:41,673 --> 00:56:43,439
"I love money."

1381
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:46,008
"I love money."

1382
00:56:46,013 --> 00:56:47,483
(They totally love it.)

1383
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:49,853
- That was so cute. - She did it.

1384
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:52,353
I've never seen it before
but I get a good sense of it.

1385
00:56:52,354 --> 00:56:53,623
That was so cute.

1386
00:56:53,624 --> 00:56:56,762
But as a viewer, the thing
I'm most curious about...

1387
00:56:56,763 --> 00:57:00,788
is that in the drama, your
singing is cleaned up...

1388
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,049
before the show airs, but
what is it like in reality?

1389
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:04,528
Opera?

1390
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,873
- Really? - I was curious about it.

1391
00:57:06,874 --> 00:57:08,532
Can we hear you sing without the recording?

1392
00:57:08,533 --> 00:57:10,439
(Sing without any music here?)

1393
00:57:10,543 --> 00:57:12,339
(Frozen for a moment)

1394
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:14,809
The three of you in the middle...

1395
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:17,012
had the most scenes like that.

1396
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:18,179
Let's do it.

1397
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:19,883
Let's decide the order
with rock paper scissors.

1398
00:57:19,884 --> 00:57:21,812
You lose if you don't
play, rock, paper, scissors.

1399
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,922
(Ro Na goes last.)

1400
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,018
You lose if you don't
play, rock, paper, scissors.

1401
00:57:25,423 --> 00:57:27,353
(Eun Byeol goes first.)

1402
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:28,953
I thought you were holding the
Cheong A Art Festival trophy.

1403
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:31,323
(It's like the results announced
at Cheong A Art Festival.)

1404
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:34,059
What are you going to sing? The final song?

1405
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:36,062
The song I sang in the
basement in season one.

1406
00:57:36,063 --> 00:57:38,562
- That's great. - That's a famous scene.

1407
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:39,932
I'm honoured to hear this.

1408
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:41,172
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Just a moment, please.

1409
00:57:41,173 --> 00:57:43,003
I have to warm up my
voice a little bit for this.

1410
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:44,699
Of course, go ahead.

1411
00:57:45,604 --> 00:57:47,412
Hee, Hee, Hee.

1412
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:49,508
She's really passionate.

1413
00:57:54,413 --> 00:57:57,419
(Making a big effort)

1414
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:00,148
What was it again?

1415
00:58:00,193 --> 00:58:02,618
(She forgot the lyrics
because she's nervous.)

1416
00:58:04,224 --> 00:58:07,888
(Still, she works hard until the very end.)

1417
00:58:10,464 --> 00:58:12,203
That was so impressive.

1418
00:58:12,204 --> 00:58:16,229
- That was great. - Brava, brava!

1419
00:58:16,403 --> 00:58:17,768
Wow.

1420
00:58:18,143 --> 00:58:19,442
You sang so well for us.

1421
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:21,312
She has so much passion.

1422
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:23,412
- Seok Kyung, how about you?
- What shall I sing for you?

1423
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:25,682
A song from season one?

1424
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:26,812
Or season two?

1425
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:27,883
Then from season two.

1426
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:30,299
(She's confident enough to
start without even warming up.)

1427
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:32,522
- This does make you nervous. - It does.

1428
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:34,949
- It does make you nervous.
- It's nervewracking.

1429
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:40,059
(Gesturing to make
sure she stays on the beat)

1430
00:58:41,763 --> 00:58:44,858
(Seok Kyung sang this over and
over for the sake of the drama.)

1431
00:58:45,433 --> 00:58:47,829
(Shall we enjoy it for a moment?)

1432
00:58:55,874 --> 00:58:57,238
I think that's how it went.

1433
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,309
Brava.

1434
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:01,652
(Seok Kyung's performance
led to a standing ovation.)

1435
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:04,079
- Brava. - Nice.

1436
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:06,052
I think I forgot the lyrics.

1437
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:07,953
You were so good.

1438
00:59:07,954 --> 00:59:10,189
It would've been terrible
if we didn't request this.

1439
00:59:10,624 --> 00:59:12,723
You're exactly like
Seok Kyung in the drama.

1440
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:13,932
You're so good at singing this.

1441
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:15,628
Now we have the grand prize winner.

1442
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:17,363
(The winner of the Cheong
A Art Festival, Ro Na)

1443
00:59:17,364 --> 00:59:19,772
That's right. She won.

1444
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:21,473
- She got the grand prize.
- With genius-like talent.

1445
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,503
In that case,

1446
00:59:23,504 --> 00:59:25,402
I'll sing the song...

1447
00:59:25,403 --> 00:59:26,713
I practiced with my mother,

1448
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:28,642
when I was applying to Cheong A.

1449
00:59:28,643 --> 00:59:30,209
It's a meaningful song too.

1450
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:41,988
(With the emotions of that time, )

1451
00:59:43,494 --> 00:59:44,863
(Ro Na sings carefully...)

1452
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:48,658
(with her pure voice.)

1453
00:59:50,303 --> 00:59:52,032
(That's a skill worthy of
the grand prize winner.)

1454
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:54,103
(Thank you.)

1455
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:55,603
- That was so great.
- At first, I wondered...

1456
00:59:55,604 --> 00:59:57,642
- if this request was all right.
- It was so good.

1457
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:59,942
- It was so refreshing.
- Thank you so much.

1458
00:59:59,943 --> 01:00:03,182
Right now, we've been filming...

1459
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,782
- for a few hours. - Right.

1460
01:00:04,783 --> 01:00:06,583
Do you want to hear something incredible?

1461
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:10,349
- What is it?
- We'll now start on season three...

1462
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,552
In season three,

1463
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:15,052
are all five of you going to become adults?

1464
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:16,288
We don't know.

1465
01:00:16,594 --> 01:00:18,459
You still don't know?

1466
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:20,063
Really?

1467
01:00:20,064 --> 01:00:21,963
You're all trying not to say a word.

1468
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:24,329
Were you all scolded by the writers?

1469
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,729
I'm sure we'll all be adults
eventually since we're ageing.

1470
01:00:29,744 --> 01:00:31,203
- What was that? - That's just...

1471
01:00:31,204 --> 01:00:33,339
exactly what Ha Eun Byeol would say.

1472
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:34,642
That was so incredible.

1473
01:00:34,643 --> 01:00:37,878
Tell us how you felt as
soon as you saw the script.

1474
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:39,108
(Gasping)

1475
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:41,608
- So that was it? - Really? That was it.

1476
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:45,248
What about you, Eun Byeol?

1477
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:48,018
(What? Oh, no...)

1478
01:00:48,094 --> 01:00:49,422
- Eun Byeol... - That's so interesting.

1479
01:00:49,423 --> 01:00:51,919
It makes me want to guess what will happen.

1480
01:00:52,063 --> 01:00:53,692
What is it? Why is she reacting like that?

1481
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,089
(What does this reaction mean?)

1482
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:56,799
Did you eat something bad?

1483
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,758
What about Ro Na, when you saw the script?

1484
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:01,329
Oh, no.

1485
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:02,902
- I see. - I see.

1486
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:05,203
All three reactions were different.

1487
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:07,573
- Min Hyuk? - What a headache.

1488
01:01:07,574 --> 01:01:08,912
- A headache. - I see.

1489
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:10,383
Last but not least, Seok Hoon.

1490
01:01:10,384 --> 01:01:12,108
For me, as soon as I saw it,

1491
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:14,083
I thought, "Really? Who?"

1492
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:16,309
- Who? - Was that too much?

1493
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:18,118
What is it?

1494
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:19,453
Because you don't know what will happen.

1495
01:01:19,454 --> 01:01:20,953
As we watch the show,

1496
01:01:20,954 --> 01:01:22,753
we'll know what those
reactions meant after all.

1497
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:25,123
So this is why Min Hyuk said
that, why Seok Hoon said that.

1498
01:01:25,124 --> 01:01:27,739
But maybe it'll end and we still
won't know why they said that.

1499
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,692
As our expectations for season three...

1500
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:31,233
continue to grow,

1501
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:33,833
there's another aspect of the
show that we should focus on.

1502
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:36,203
There are three more characters
that hold the key to the plot.

1503
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:37,868
Let's meet them through video.

1504
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:45,442
My baby is sleeping so well.

1505
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:47,812
I love Eun Byeol very much.

1506
01:01:47,813 --> 01:01:50,123
I think of her as my own daughter,

1507
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:53,788
so if it's for her, I could
make a deal with evil.

1508
01:01:54,224 --> 01:01:57,518
(A manic obsession with
Eun Byeol, Jin Bun Hong)

1509
01:01:57,724 --> 01:02:00,932
My princess. I'll be home soon. See you.

1510
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:02,593
An ally who's of help to his family,

1511
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,032
and an enemy to everyone else.

1512
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:07,069
(His reason for living
is family, Yoo Dong Pil)

1513
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:09,768
I'm excited because it's been so long.

1514
01:02:12,204 --> 01:02:15,012
He is Baek Jun Ki, but he also may not be.

1515
01:02:15,013 --> 01:02:17,713
A fake that seems real,
the real that seems fake.

1516
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:20,479
(Neither real nor fake, Baek Jun Ki)

1517
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:25,479
(The actors will introduce these
three critical roles personally.)

1518
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:28,292
Hello, I'm actor Park Ho San,

1519
01:02:28,293 --> 01:02:31,062
who plays the role of Yoo
Dong Pil in The Penthouse 3.

1520
01:02:31,063 --> 01:02:35,032
I think many people
thought of me as a gangster.

1521
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:38,032
I thought so as well, at first,
but I'm actually very detailed.

1522
01:02:38,033 --> 01:02:40,772
I think deeply about things,
and aspire to be a force for good...

1523
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:42,073
for my family, and the enemy
to those who oppose my family.

1524
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:44,473
It's understandable, but not justifiable.

1525
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:45,703
That's the role I play.

1526
01:02:45,704 --> 01:02:47,573
Hello, I'm actor On Ju Wan,

1527
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:50,442
playing Baek Jun Ki on The Penthouse.

1528
01:02:50,443 --> 01:02:52,682
Ki Joon introduced me to the role,

1529
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:54,812
asking me if I'd like to meet
the writer, Kim Soon Ok.

1530
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,652
When we first met,

1531
01:02:56,653 --> 01:03:00,692
the writer told me she'd like
me to play a hero-like role.

1532
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:04,623
But if I listen to the things
people say about the character,

1533
01:03:04,624 --> 01:03:06,022
he's not a hero.

1534
01:03:06,023 --> 01:03:08,963
I heard he was a hero, so I
thought he'd vanquish evil,

1535
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:11,363
like the Avengers do,

1536
01:03:11,364 --> 01:03:14,373
but what the director tells me,

1537
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:17,473
and what the rumours tell me,

1538
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:19,973
- is that he's a villain.
- He's the worst villain ever.

1539
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:21,172
It's very confusing.

1540
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:24,079
One side calls him a
villain, and the other a hero.

1541
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:26,142
If I were to provide more
hints that are more helpful,

1542
01:03:26,143 --> 01:03:29,479
he's like a fake that seems
real, and the real that seems fake.

1543
01:03:30,584 --> 01:03:32,449
That means...

1544
01:03:33,494 --> 01:03:35,753
he goes back and forth.

1545
01:03:35,754 --> 01:03:38,618
Hello, I'm actress Ahn Yeon Hong,

1546
01:03:38,624 --> 01:03:41,593
who plays Jin Bun Hong in The Penthouse.

1547
01:03:41,594 --> 01:03:45,299
She's a mysterious figure who
doesn't distinguish good from evil.

1548
01:03:45,464 --> 01:03:47,703
That's how they explained
the character to me.

1549
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:49,902
(Critical Scene, "Hello, sir.")

1550
01:03:49,903 --> 01:03:51,368
Hello, sir.

1551
01:03:53,214 --> 01:03:54,812
Secretary Cho is close with me.

1552
01:03:54,813 --> 01:03:57,282
He was definitely one of my people before.

1553
01:03:57,283 --> 01:04:00,583
I think that's why he came
to see me when I left prison.

1554
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:03,323
How their relationship will
develop, only the writer knows that.

1555
01:04:03,324 --> 01:04:05,422
The unique thing about The Penthouse...

1556
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:07,018
is that no one knows what's coming.

1557
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:09,422
It's amazing, and fun,

1558
01:04:09,423 --> 01:04:12,093
and also makes you despair.
It makes you feel many things.

1559
01:04:12,094 --> 01:04:14,288
It's my first time doing
a drama in this way.

1560
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:16,902
But that's how much
faith we have in the writer,

1561
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:20,103
and because we've
achieved good results so far,

1562
01:04:20,104 --> 01:04:21,973
our faith in the writer
has grown even more.

1563
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:25,138
Now, I'm just making sure
I'm faithful to the script.

1564
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:27,412
My poor thing.

1565
01:04:27,413 --> 01:04:29,768
Call me Mom from now on.

1566
01:04:30,543 --> 01:04:32,113
Call me mom.

1567
01:04:32,114 --> 01:04:34,012
Even I grew curious about it,

1568
01:04:34,013 --> 01:04:36,008
as I was acting out my role.

1569
01:04:36,214 --> 01:04:40,052
As far as I know, Logan was the mastermind,

1570
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:42,453
but why am I changing so much?

1571
01:04:42,454 --> 01:04:43,792
That's what I started thinking,

1572
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:47,062
and I wondered if I didn't
have some kind of trauma...

1573
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:48,493
related to children that
have caused this obsession,

1574
01:04:48,494 --> 01:04:51,902
this twisted motherly love.

1575
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:54,699
To be honest, I'm very
curious about what will happen.

1576
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,503
Can I go have a smoke first?

1577
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:00,012
Sure, go ahead.

1578
01:05:00,013 --> 01:05:05,308
(Critical Scene, "Can I
go have a smoke first?")

1579
01:05:05,413 --> 01:05:09,179
(An unbelievable coincidence?
Or a secret conspiracy?)

1580
01:05:09,483 --> 01:05:12,383
The way I look at it, I still
think there is no relation...

1581
01:05:12,384 --> 01:05:15,992
between Baek Jun Ki and the exploding car.

1582
01:05:15,993 --> 01:05:18,492
He got out of the car, leaving his bag,

1583
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:22,258
gazes at him once, and
then disappears somewhere.

1584
01:05:22,864 --> 01:05:24,359
To be honest,

1585
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:27,932
some people could think I
left the bag in there on purpose,

1586
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:29,702
but if there was a bomb in it,

1587
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:32,002
why didn't airport security catch it?

1588
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:35,212
I don't think I'm the one
who tried to kill Logan.

1589
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:37,442
(Are you sure?)

1590
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:40,053
I can't be sure, with this drama.

1591
01:05:40,054 --> 01:05:42,583
I'm sorry, but I just
think he's not related.

1592
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:46,848
(Which character should we
focus on most in season three?)

1593
01:05:46,854 --> 01:05:48,649
I think...

1594
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:50,523
Jin Bun Hong.

1595
01:05:50,524 --> 01:05:52,023
(Jin Bun Hong)

1596
01:05:52,024 --> 01:05:54,192
I think my role is really fun,

1597
01:05:54,193 --> 01:05:55,633
and I think it's set up
for a plot twist coming up.

1598
01:05:55,634 --> 01:05:57,263
You'll be shocked if you watch.

1599
01:05:57,264 --> 01:06:00,033
There's something
shocking that's coming soon.

1600
01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:01,603
Because I'm a character
that's been around...

1601
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:03,972
since season one,

1602
01:06:03,973 --> 01:06:07,343
I know a lot of people have
expectations while watching.

1603
01:06:07,344 --> 01:06:09,442
I do have a certain
number of confirmed scenes.

1604
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:11,258
I'm sure everyone picked themselves, right?

1605
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:14,613
I guess I'll pick myself too.

1606
01:06:14,614 --> 01:06:17,152
Jun Ki is a person...

1607
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:19,452
who knows Joo Dan Tae's past.

1608
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:23,492
That's his greatest weapon.

1609
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:26,162
I also think that Dong Pil...

1610
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:30,103
will side with good,

1611
01:06:30,104 --> 01:06:31,104
in my opinion.

1612
01:06:31,105 --> 01:06:32,863
I think he'll end up being a just person.

1613
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,702
(Are you sure?)

1614
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:36,373
I told you I can't be sure.

1615
01:06:36,374 --> 01:06:38,242
I don't even know about my own character.

1616
01:06:38,243 --> 01:06:40,098
How can I know anything about Dong Pil?

1617
01:06:40,173 --> 01:06:42,543
I just think that might happen.

1618
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,442
Jin Bun Hong...

1619
01:06:44,443 --> 01:06:47,952
I've never seen her in
person, not even on set.

1620
01:06:47,953 --> 01:06:49,752
I'm not sure if I can say this,

1621
01:06:49,753 --> 01:06:53,018
but as a character, she
doesn't seem totally sane.

1622
01:06:53,253 --> 01:06:57,192
The way she speaks reminds
me of the movie, "Misery."

1623
01:06:57,193 --> 01:07:01,229
I wonder if that's the
kind of character she is.

1624
01:07:02,163 --> 01:07:06,133
Even when he's just standing
around, he looks so dashing.

1625
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:09,232
Just looking at him is so nice.

1626
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:11,098
It's so satisfying.

1627
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:15,068
You should've told me that in advance.

1628
01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:19,479
I'm sure she's also beautiful and kind.

1629
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:22,682
But to speak only about
her character, 100 percent,

1630
01:07:22,683 --> 01:07:24,682
I'm wondering if...

1631
01:07:24,683 --> 01:07:26,952
that might not be the case.

1632
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:29,809
I said that so carefully, but all
of a sudden, after the interview...

1633
01:07:30,364 --> 01:07:32,892
Many of the characters in The Penthouse...

1634
01:07:32,893 --> 01:07:34,563
are curious about me.

1635
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:37,962
They seem to think of
me as very mysterious.

1636
01:07:37,963 --> 01:07:39,162
I can't tell what she's like.

1637
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,202
She's truly a mystery.

1638
01:07:41,203 --> 01:07:42,899
Do I seem like a psycho?

1639
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:46,502
Jun Ki's goal is to get back what's his.

1640
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:47,813
Will he waver?

1641
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,113
That could be money,

1642
01:07:49,114 --> 01:07:51,412
and he might waver due to the temptation.

1643
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:53,013
I think that's one point to watch for.

1644
01:07:53,014 --> 01:07:55,179
Jin Bun Hong...

1645
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:58,123
doesn't have any ambitions
about the penthouse,

1646
01:07:58,124 --> 01:07:59,823
or about money.

1647
01:07:59,824 --> 01:08:02,392
But for Eun Byeol, she has a
lot of strong feelings for her only.

1648
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:03,793
She's always on Eun Byeol's side.

1649
01:08:03,794 --> 01:08:05,593
I really love Eun Byeol.

1650
01:08:05,594 --> 01:08:07,593
I think of her as my own daughter,

1651
01:08:07,594 --> 01:08:08,932
so if it's for her, I could make a deal...

1652
01:08:08,933 --> 01:08:11,058
with evil.

1653
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:17,498
(But Eun Byeol already has a mom.)

1654
01:08:17,574 --> 01:08:19,869
We need to compete for Eun Byeol.

1655
01:08:20,104 --> 01:08:22,313
I'd like to meet her soon.

1656
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:23,942
(Onjuwan1211, Who am I and where am I?)

1657
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:25,083
(I hope everyone looks forward
to the first episode on June 4.)

1658
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:30,318
(What does this social media post mean?)

1659
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:31,949
I really didn't know who I am.

1660
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:35,623
I'm playing a villain,

1661
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:37,222
but also filming scenes where I smile.

1662
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:39,959
I'm pretending to be nice too.

1663
01:08:40,124 --> 01:08:41,962
It feels like I'm actually
playing three roles at once.

1664
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:43,328
It's driving me insane.

1665
01:08:44,604 --> 01:08:46,873
What I was talking about is this.

1666
01:08:46,874 --> 01:08:49,373
What if I'm not the person...

1667
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:51,843
who knows about Joo Dan
Tae and his past after all?

1668
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:55,008
What if everything is a plan?

1669
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:56,883
That's how far I got.

1670
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,979
I could be Baek Jun Ki, but also not.

1671
01:09:00,384 --> 01:09:01,452
You know what I mean, right?

1672
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,883
You can see how much
this is driving me insane.

1673
01:09:03,884 --> 01:09:07,088
As a character, it's a bit confusing,

1674
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:08,553
so I asked Ki Joon for advice.

1675
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:12,119
I heard some secretive
stuff, which went like this.

1676
01:09:12,264 --> 01:09:13,533
What do you think?

1677
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:14,833
He said he didn't know.

1678
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:15,863
(Consultation with Ki Joon is over.)

1679
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:17,063
Even Dan Tae didn't know.

1680
01:09:17,064 --> 01:09:19,558
I think Ki Joon just gave up.

1681
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:23,738
I think he's the type to
focus just on the scenes...

1682
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:26,642
he's in each week.

1683
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:29,773
There are still plot lines
that haven't been resolved,

1684
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:32,538
embedded in the plot like time bombs.

1685
01:09:32,983 --> 01:09:34,513
When will they explode?

1686
01:09:34,514 --> 01:09:36,452
I'm also looking forward to that,

1687
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:38,283
as I continue to prepare for my own role.

1688
01:09:38,284 --> 01:09:41,389
Right now, everything I said,

1689
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:45,018
and everything the other
actors have said so far...

1690
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,093
can go in one ear and out the other.

1691
01:09:48,094 --> 01:09:50,093
That's how chaotic this
drama will be, I think.

1692
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:51,803
That's why you can focus on what happens,

1693
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:54,202
and deduce and predict things on your own,

1694
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:55,672
becoming your own detective.

1695
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:58,702
I believe that way,

1696
01:09:58,703 --> 01:10:00,318
you'll really enjoy watching the show.

1697
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:04,109
Which person do you think
deserves the focus of attention?

1698
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:06,383
I just thought of something...

1699
01:10:06,384 --> 01:10:08,479
- about Jin Bun Hong. - What is it?

1700
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:10,323
Some people thought
this about the character.

1701
01:10:10,324 --> 01:10:13,619
Eun Byeol is being punished
by meeting Jin Bun Hong.

1702
01:10:13,624 --> 01:10:15,189
And?

1703
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,788
- And? - That's all.

1704
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:19,962
Oh, so it wasn't a question
or a response to the question.

1705
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:21,033
You were just relaying the news.

1706
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:23,263
I was just sharing what I'd heard.

1707
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:24,603
What about Yoo Dong Pil?

1708
01:10:24,604 --> 01:10:27,232
I've met with Dong Pil...

1709
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,932
from time to time.

1710
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,373
- Isn't that a big spoiler?
- Is that meaningful?

1711
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:31,538
That we met?

1712
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:33,442
You're all making each other very anxious.

1713
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:34,768
Why are you doing that to me?

1714
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:36,469
I'm not allowed to say that part?

1715
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:40,409
The scariest phrase for
all of The Penthouse is this.

1716
01:10:40,453 --> 01:10:41,578
"Is it a spoiler?"

1717
01:10:41,913 --> 01:10:43,053
Is it not?

1718
01:10:43,054 --> 01:10:44,383
I'm curious why they met,

1719
01:10:44,384 --> 01:10:46,353
and what they did in their meetings.

1720
01:10:46,354 --> 01:10:49,152
I saw that scene with Jenny's dad,

1721
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:51,422
and went to film something
else in Yangyang right afterwards.

1722
01:10:51,423 --> 01:10:54,258
I should've greeted
him, but it was too scary.

1723
01:10:54,693 --> 01:10:56,588
So I couldn't greet him after all.

1724
01:10:57,764 --> 01:10:59,098
Is that it? Was that the news?

1725
01:10:59,403 --> 01:11:00,533
(Chuckling)

1726
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:02,068
Please watch the show to see.

1727
01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:04,642
If we're just going to find out
everything by watching the show,

1728
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,073
- what's the point of this special?
- You're right.

1729
01:11:06,074 --> 01:11:09,139
- If we just have to watch the
show, - Why bother talking here?

1730
01:11:09,314 --> 01:11:10,343
Now...

1731
01:11:10,344 --> 01:11:11,344
(The time everyone has been waiting for)

1732
01:11:11,345 --> 01:11:12,383
it's time.

1733
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:14,553
It's no exaggeration to say...

1734
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:16,182
our entire show will
culminate in this video.

1735
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:18,823
- None of you have seen it before? - No.

1736
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:19,982
I wonder how it turned out.

1737
01:11:19,983 --> 01:11:22,192
I'll introduce it using a
particularly impressive voice.

1738
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:23,348
Never before seen!

1739
01:11:23,764 --> 01:11:25,258
You sound like Kim Kyung Sik.

1740
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:26,324
(Giggling)

1741
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:27,828
There is a man right here.

1742
01:11:28,193 --> 01:11:29,193
That's true.

1743
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:30,863
- I'll add more gravity. - All right.

1744
01:11:30,864 --> 01:11:31,962
Never before seen!

1745
01:11:31,963 --> 01:11:34,633
Here is the trailer...

1746
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:36,798
for The Penthouse 3.

1747
01:11:37,403 --> 01:11:39,672
(The Penthouse 3)

1748
01:11:39,673 --> 01:11:42,068
It's the prison.

1749
01:11:42,314 --> 01:11:44,682
This place is just like Hera Palace.

1750
01:11:44,683 --> 01:11:47,553
There's a penthouse in this prison too.

1751
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,412
A prison penthouse?

1752
01:11:49,413 --> 01:11:50,482
It's my dad.

1753
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:52,123
Don't you dare touch my food!

1754
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:53,182
I'll break you all.

1755
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:54,318
Wow.

1756
01:11:54,594 --> 01:11:56,288
- Dad... - You have to eat to live.

1757
01:11:56,953 --> 01:11:58,459
It's not time to give up yet.

1758
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:01,058
Do what makes you happy.

1759
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:02,232
Logan is dead.

1760
01:12:02,233 --> 01:12:04,959
I don't rely on the
judgement of the law anymore.

1761
01:12:05,463 --> 01:12:06,962
Everything I tell you from now on,

1762
01:12:06,963 --> 01:12:08,932
make sure it never gets back to Su Ryeon.

1763
01:12:08,933 --> 01:12:10,498
To Su Ryeon?

1764
01:12:12,003 --> 01:12:13,813
- What is it? - So there's a huge secret.

1765
01:12:13,814 --> 01:12:14,939
Dad.

1766
01:12:15,173 --> 01:12:18,543
That person will reveal Joo Dan Tae's past.

1767
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:20,949
Eun Byeol's guardian is me.

1768
01:12:22,453 --> 01:12:23,649
Get rid of them?

1769
01:12:24,683 --> 01:12:25,982
If you don't want to live like a pig,

1770
01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:28,192
you have to pay for
your sins no matter what.

1771
01:12:28,193 --> 01:12:29,348
Why did you do that?

1772
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,988
- What was that? - Yes, just now.

1773
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:35,063
What is it?

1774
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:37,058
- Get out of here. - Seok Kyung.

1775
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,429
Why are you insisting on dying?

1776
01:12:39,634 --> 01:12:41,028
I'm going to kill you all.

1777
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:43,273
We have to make him remember everything.

1778
01:12:43,274 --> 01:12:45,043
He's a total crazy fool.

1779
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:47,139
- Where is he now?
- You think I don't know?

1780
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:50,538
Do you still think I'm Shim Su Ryeon?

1781
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:54,353
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1782
01:12:54,354 --> 01:12:55,848
- Oh, no. - If you do anything,

1783
01:12:56,814 --> 01:12:58,053
I'll kill you myself.

1784
01:12:58,054 --> 01:13:00,588
(The Penthouse 3 airs on June 4, 10pm)

1785
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:02,018
From now on,

1786
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:04,462
shall we begin in earnest?

1787
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,719
So that wasn't Shim Su Ryeon?

1788
01:13:07,024 --> 01:13:08,533
I was so shocked when
I read that in the script.

1789
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:09,962
Oh, that line?

1790
01:13:09,963 --> 01:13:11,202
What was that?

1791
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:12,359
(Rendered speechless)

1792
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:13,833
I got goosebumps.

1793
01:13:13,834 --> 01:13:16,210
- That's going to be so much fun.
- They made it so well.

1794
01:13:16,304 --> 01:13:18,502
My heart really felt like it
was squeezing the whole time.

1795
01:13:18,503 --> 01:13:21,813
- I can't wait to find out.
- I can't seem to predict...

1796
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:22,873
what's going to happen in the middle.

1797
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:24,942
I'm so curious now. Anyway...

1798
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:27,252
From the time this show will
air, the first episode is in two days.

1799
01:13:27,253 --> 01:13:29,212
That's right. June 4, Friday,

1800
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:32,248
is when the first episode
of The Penthouse 3, airs.

1801
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,192
- That's right.
- We should all watch it then.

1802
01:13:34,193 --> 01:13:35,323
I'm so nervous.

1803
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:36,892
I hope everyone watches
the show when it first airs.

1804
01:13:36,893 --> 01:13:39,763
Thank you so much for being with us,

1805
01:13:39,764 --> 01:13:41,363
here on The Penthouse 3 Hidden
Room, The Start of the End.

1806
01:13:41,364 --> 01:13:43,162
Any feelings you'd like to share?

1807
01:13:43,163 --> 01:13:45,232
We've been working
together for a whole year now.

1808
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:47,732
Any regrets we have are
just turned into motivation.

1809
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:49,833
With the desire to have no regrets.

1810
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:51,142
To give our all.

1811
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:53,472
We hope our hard work
pays off even in season three.

1812
01:13:53,473 --> 01:13:54,672
It's like you're making a birthday wish...

1813
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:56,008
before blowing out the candles.

1814
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,383
"Please, I want this
for my birthday and..."

1815
01:13:57,384 --> 01:14:00,982
Please show us a lot
of love for season three.

1816
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,709
(Please show The
Penthouse 3 a lot of love!)
