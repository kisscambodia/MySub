1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,560
Are you going to pursue duckling
even though she thinks you're gay?

4
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,000
You won't succeed.

5
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,400
You know that when
I have eyes for someone,

6
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
I have to have them.

7
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,879
Do you really like her,

8
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,759
or you think this is a game?

9
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Both.

10
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,039
Lan, watch out!

11
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,319
Does this mean
Mook will suffer in my son's place?

12
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,960
- That's right.
- Is there a way to fix this?

13
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,240
They have to travel.
Then their stars will change.

14
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,680
Go on a honeymoon with me.

15
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,639
No way.

16
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,240
If you don't go with me,

17
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,639
I have to be alone with duckling.

18
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,520
Then I will go. When is it?

19
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,319
- Come with me.
- Why?

20
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,599
We've been followed.

21
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
They are on a honeymoon?

22
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,400
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

23
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,080
Mook probably has had
her way with Lan by now.

24
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you think I should follow him?

25
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
No, don't follow him.

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,639
I heard that
Rut will also be there for work.

27
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,800
My brother probably has a plan.

28
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,360
You can find a way to make him
fall for you after his return.

29
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
I think we have to
take this more seriously.

30
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,120
We can't lose to her.

31
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,080
I almost had Lan the other day,

32
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
but I was interrupted by her.

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,759
She is a formidable opponent.

34
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,680
You can be just as formidable.
I give you free rein.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,960
You have my full support.

36
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,919
Win.

37
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,439
What is it?

38
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,280
I brought you the incident report
from the factory.

39
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,439
I'll leave you two alone.

40
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,480
According to the report,
the incident was caused

41
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,519
by an unkempt workspace
and worker negligence.

42
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,639
The factory manager will
carry out more rigorous inspections.

43
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,360
Is there anything suspicious?

44
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,240
Based on my investigation,
I found nothing suspicious.

45
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,120
You have to be more careful.

46
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959
Why are you smiling?

47
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,920
Well, am I not allowed to
enjoy this beautiful scenery?

48
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,079
- Hold on.
- What is it?

49
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,879
Let's take some pictures
and send them to your parents.

50
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
For what?

51
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,439
Well, they will want to see
how we're doing on our honeymoon.

52
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,439
This is annoying.

53
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,959
- Hey.
- Come on. Smile.

54
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,160
Look at them. They're adorable.

55
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,279
Now we can be sure that
they're actually on a honeymoon.

56
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,399
I agree, dear.

57
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,759
Wait.

58
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,480
Our son is so irritating.

59
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,240
- Why?
- Look at his pretentious face.

60
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
He's just like you. You think making
that face makes you look handsome.

61
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,839
Oh, come on.

62
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,839
Do you think there's a chance of us
getting a grandkid after this trip?

63
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,800
I want Mook to take this opportunity
to make our son hers.

64
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Dear, take it easy.
She won't do that.

65
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,319
However,

66
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,680
I believe Lan making a move on her

67
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
is more likely to happen

68
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,079
since there is so much potential.

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
This time

70
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,279
he will forget about
the whole gay charade.

71
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
Mook and Lan have history together.

72
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,600
Their bond is deep.

73
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,679
His hatred cannot destroy her love.

74
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,090
Trust me.

75
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,330
Of course. Trusting my wife
is the best thing to do.

76
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Oh.

77
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,799
Look at this.

78
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
Wow.

79
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,759
This place is beautiful.

80
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,450
Absolutely. We must be very lucky
to get to stay here.

81
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,450
Thank you.

82
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,210
Well, here's the thing.

83
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,279
One of the pipes is broken.

84
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,330
As a result,
some of the rooms aren't available.

85
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,240
But don't worry.

86
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,799
They've prepared us a place
to stay together.

87
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,519
Well.

88
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,450
As expected of my number one
secretary. Great work.

89
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,330
This is beyond our control.
He didn't mean for this to happen.

90
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,450
She's right.

91
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
Keep protecting him.

92
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,879
Do you realize that you won't have
a place to sleep tonight?

93
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,330
Why do you say that?

94
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,720
Poom just told us that
they've prepared a place for us.

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,360
We can all sleep in there.

96
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,210
No. You're a woman. You can't sleep
in the same room with men.

97
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,919
I agree with him.
Are you sure it's a good idea?

98
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,720
Well, we can each stay
in our own corner.

99
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,519
It's only for tonight.
I'm sure it's fine.

100
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,840
It's not going to happen.

101
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,679
If your guardian knows that I let
you sleep in a room with three men,

102
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,279
they will be upset.

103
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,759
If by guardian you mean my sister,

104
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,639
I'm sure she'll be okay with it
since she knows you're...

105
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,399
Lan's boyfriend.

106
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,720
Poom can be trusted.

107
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,039
Oak and I know each other.
There won't be a problem.

108
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,679
- Whatever, it's not going to...
- I think we should stop arguing.

109
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,600
For now let's check out
the place they've prepared for us.

110
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,679
Then we can make a decision.
What do you say?

111
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,799
I agree with him, Boss.

112
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,600
Please, Marut.

113
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,879
Wow.

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,840
This is huge.
It can accommodate several people.

115
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,720
Indeed.
I think we can all sleep here.

116
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
- Right?
- Right?

117
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,840
You get along well.

118
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Boss,

119
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,360
I've checked with nearby hotels.
They are all fully booked.

120
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,559
With a room this big,

121
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,919
I think we can comfortably
divide space for the four of us.

122
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,080
I agree with Poom.

123
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,480
I will talk to Mook about Nampetch.

124
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,279
It's three to one now, Boss.

125
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,799
Alright.

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Poom,

127
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,440
ask the hotel to prepare
space for Oak and Nampetch.

128
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,559
Sure.

129
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,679
I don't care how you feel.

130
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,039
Try to get used to seeing my face.

131
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,080
Because all I care about
is your safety.

132
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,879
She is a terrible photographer.

133
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,960
Lovely pictures, aren't they?

134
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
Have you started to
feel things for me?

135
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
I don't feel a thing.

136
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,639
Are you sure?

137
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,159
Shall we bathe together then?

138
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,879
You're shameless. Don't you get
embarrassed saying such a thing?

139
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,600
Well, since this is our honeymoon,
we should enjoy our moment together.

140
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,639
I will make this one
memorable for you.

141
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
You bathe me.

142
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,279
I bathe you.

143
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,960
Slowly rubbing soap over you,
starting from your arm

144
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,720
to your shoulder.

145
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,440
And then...

146
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,159
Let me wash your body,
so you can relax.

147
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,879
I...

148
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,639
I...

149
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,159
Are you shy?

150
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,399
We're married.

151
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,600
We are pretty much one person.

152
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,039
We should have been intimate
with each other a long time ago.

153
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
You're very muscular.

154
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,559
Your heart is racing.

155
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,000
Mine is racing too.

156
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,519
Feel it.

157
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,879
I will make your heart
race even faster.

158
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,799
Finally you're mine.

159
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,159
You will be mine forever.

160
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,480
You lost to me, Lan.

161
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,399
Hey, no!

162
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,679
Stop talking.
I won't walk into your trap.

163
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,799
The only person
I will bathe with is Rut.

164
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,360
Don't you want to try it?

165
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,799
I can make you forget about him.

166
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,840
I won't stop loving him.

167
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,120
No matter how hard you try to
seduce me, I won't feel a thing.

168
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,879
We'll see how long
you can control yourself.

169
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,159
Right, and stop trying to seduce me.
I'm running out of patience.

170
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,679
If you don't stop,

171
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,279
I will tie you to the pillar.

172
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,240
Sounds scary.

173
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,279
Duckling, what are you doing?

174
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm making you fall in love with me,

175
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,679
have only me in your mind.

176
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,679
You can say you hate me
as many times as you want.

177
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,759
I don't care what you say to me.

178
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,440
All I care about

179
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
is your heart.

180
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,599
I've arrived.

181
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,720
Tomorrow after I'm done with work,
I will come and see you.

182
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,720
Come here as fast as you can.
I don't think I can take it anymore.

183
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,079
What do you mean?

184
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,039
Wait.

185
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,599
Did you and Mook...

186
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,680
No way. That woman can't
make me feel anything.

187
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,519
Duckling has been acting
like my shadow,

188
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,480
trying to test if I'm gay or not.

189
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm so sick of her.

190
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,960
I've been wondering

191
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,119
if her friend joined the trip
to observe me.

192
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,890
Be careful.

193
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,559
Mook and her friend
may have planned something.

194
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,410
I'm curious about their plan.

195
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,720
Should I seduce Rut tonight?

196
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,200
That way, we'll find out
if he likes men or not.

197
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,440
Listen, you don't have
to be that committed.

198
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,319
You told me before
that your gaydar didn't ping.

199
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,759
If you seduce him and he kicks you,

200
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,410
judging from his large frame,

201
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,319
he will break your bones
and I won't be able to help you.

202
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,359
Oh, I can picture it in my head.

203
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,279
I was just kidding.

204
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,650
Look, if you want to test Lan,

205
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,890
you can seduce him.
You have my support.

206
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,079
Are you crazy? I can't do that.

207
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,799
Well, your voice is shaking.

208
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,480
You aren't firm about the idea.
You feel something, don't you?

209
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,279
No way.

210
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,039
I spoke very firmly.
You heard it wrong.

211
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,650
Oh, really?

212
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,890
Don't forget that
you have only a year with him.

213
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
Your goal is to get back at him

214
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,839
by making him fall for you
and then dump him.

215
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,119
This means you can't love him

216
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,680
or sleep with him.

217
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,720
Otherwise, it will be you
who gets hurt the most.

218
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,559
You can't let your feelings
get the best of you.

219
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,890
I know what I'm doing.

220
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,650
I won't be reckless
with someone I don't love.

221
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,410
The number you've dialed
can't be connected. Try again later.

222
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
Where are you?
Why did you turn your phone off?

223
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,890
Call me back.

224
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,359
(Treenuch)

225
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,200
Lan, what are you doing?

226
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,890
Lan is taking a bath.

227
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,799
Mook, how dare you answer his phone.

228
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,720
Am I not allowed to
answer my husband's phone?

229
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,960
I answered his phone because
I'm tired of shameless women.

230
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,240
It's just a mock marriage.
How dare you claim that he is yours.

231
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,650
Don't you feel ashamed
to call him your husband?

232
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,359
It's still considered a marriage.

233
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
It's better than
being an ex-girlfriend

234
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,759
who isn't even his friend
nor his acquaintance.

235
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,480
Nothing. A nobody.

236
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,200
If I were you,

237
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,720
I would feel very hurt.

238
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,440
But if I were you,
I would hurt even more.

239
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,799
You confessed your love to him
and he rejected you.

240
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,170
If his parents didn't force him,
he would never marry you.

241
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,359
Stay in your lane.
This is between me and him.

242
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,440
Did I just rile you up?

243
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,170
I will make you lose this
wife position you're so proud of.

244
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,170
Be my guest.

245
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,200
Be careful.
Old flames burn brighter.

246
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,410
I won't interrupt
your honeymoon anymore.

247
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,960
Tell him I miss him
and let's meet again in Bangkok.

248
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,559
(Marriage Certificate)

249
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,680
You're his past. I'm his present.

250
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,359
Marriages can end in divorce.

251
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Stop.

252
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,440
Tonight you will sleep
on the sofa outside.

253
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,279
I will sleep in this room.

254
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
You aren't allowed to come in.

255
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,880
We will sleep separately.

256
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,519
What are you afraid of?

257
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,279
I'm afraid you will try to touch me.
I don't want to sleep with you.

258
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,279
Do you think sleeping separately
will make you safe?

259
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,240
No matter where you sleep,

260
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960
if I want to make you mine,
I can make it happen.

261
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,480
Don't you feel ashamed of
the things you said?

262
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,079
You are so shameless.

263
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,079
Being bold can get you anywhere.

264
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,599
I can't wait to test your sexuality

265
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,119
and find out if you're gay or not.

266
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,319
Do you remember what I told you?
I will use my right.

267
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,759
Don't be distracted tonight.

268
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,400
Because if you get distracted,

269
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,519
I will make you mine.

270
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,759
I'm not scared of your threats.

271
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,160
Not even a little?

272
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,000
Then be careful tonight,
my beloved husband.

273
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,920
Shall we sleep on this bed?

274
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,839
This is my bed. Go somewhere else.

275
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,680
- Get out now.
- No, I want this bed.

276
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,599
- Get out.
- No, let go.

277
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,519
- Let go of me.
- No.

278
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,039
- I will sleep here.
- Duckling!

279
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,160
- This is my bed. Get out!
- No!

280
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,960
- Hey!
- Get out!

281
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,799
I'm taking the bed.

282
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,200
- Come here.
- Oh.

283
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,640
- Get out of the bed.
- Duckling!

284
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm not getting out of my bed.

285
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,759
Duckling!

286
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,920
- No, I'm not leaving.
- You won't leave, will you?

287
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,200
- Ah!
- Get up!

288
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,720
Move!

289
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,640
Get off!

290
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Stubborn woman.

291
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,599
Get out.

292
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Duckling.

293
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,079
- Will you surrender?
- No way.

294
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,359
I surrender! I surrender!

295
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,759
I surrender!
You can sleep anywhere you want.

296
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,680
I surrender! I surrender!

297
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,960
- Let go.
- There you go.

298
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,200
Make yourself comfortable.

299
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,119
Hey.

300
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,079
Duckling.

301
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Hey.

302
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,279
Hey.

303
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,839
Did she just fall asleep?

304
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,039
Poom.

305
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Are they competing
in a snoring championship?

306
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,680
Duckling!

307
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,839
Were you a gecko in your past life?
You have sticky feet.

308
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,160
You even touch me in your sleep.

309
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,079
One sheep.

310
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,440
Two sheep.

311
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,960
Three sheep.

312
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,440
Four ducklings.

313
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,359
Five ducklings.

314
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,839
Six ducklings.

315
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
Where were you all day?

316
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,720
I told you I went to another city.

317
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,440
Why did you turn off your phone?
You didn't even answer my voicemail.

318
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,559
Oh.

319
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
My battery died. I didn't realize.

320
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,599
I was busy and didn't check.
I came back as soon as I was done.

321
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:18,079
Are you sure it's work
and not something else?

322
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,400
Honestly, I was working.

323
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,720
I wasn't fooling around.

324
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,599
I came back as soon as
I had finished with work.

325
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
I don't care how late it is.
I don't want to stay at a hotel.

326
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,799
I'd rather fall asleep
with you in my arms.

327
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,640
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

328
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,119
I didn't do anything wrong.

329
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,519
The phone was an accident.

330
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,160
If you're mad at me,

331
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,359
I will make it up to you.

332
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,200
Oh, wait.

333
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,720
Careful.

334
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,680
Sorry.

335
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,519
Rut, are you okay?

336
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:13,880
Your heart is beating fast.

337
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,809
Are you watching me?

338
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,119
No.

339
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,920
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

340
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,360
No, you're projecting.

341
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,400
Eight ducklings.

342
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,599
Nine ducklings.

343
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,480
Ten ducklings.

344
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,679
Eleven ducklings.

345
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,840
No, Mook. Focus.

346
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,840
See you this evening.

347
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,679
No progress on Rut so far.
I'll keep looking for the chance.

348
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,769
Shall we stop by somewhere
on the way to Lan?

349
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,119
- No, we'll head straight to him.
- Okay.

350
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,769
- Rut.
- Lan.

351
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:35,880
Why are you so happy to see me?

352
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:37,920
I'm really happy to see you.

353
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,840
If you were a second late,
I would be eaten by her.

354
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,400
Mook, I miss you so much.

355
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,559
Hey, are you this happy to see me?

356
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:58,079
Listen. I have so much to tell you
about the conference.

357
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,719
Can I stay with you tonight?

358
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,289
You can't, Petch.
Lan and I are on our honeymoon.

359
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,840
If you want to talk to me,
we can talk during the day.

360
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:29,519
Now, how will you arrange
our accommodation for tonight?

361
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,639
Since I know you all want to
spend your precious time together,

362
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,039
I've arranged for you
to stay in one room.

363
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,769
You can decide
where you want to sleep.

364
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,119
Rut, I miss you so much.

365
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,960
We'll sleep together tonight.

366
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,239
Don't worry. I haven't touched
duckling at all the last few nights.

367
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,559
Rut.

368
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,119
I haven't touched him either,
so don't feel jealous.

369
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,239
But I want to stay with you tonight.

370
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,329
I have so much to tell you
about our trip.

371
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Alright.

372
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,289
Mook, you should stay with me.

373
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,960
I really miss you.

374
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,840
You should stay with your sister.
I want to spend time with my lover.

375
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,960
But I want to talk to him.

376
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:28,329
I want to spend time with my lover.

377
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,519
- He will stay with me.
- He is my lover.

378
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,360
- He will stay with me.
- He is my lover.

379
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,119
- He will stay with me.
- He is my lover.

380
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:35,639
- He will stay with me.
- Hey!

381
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,719
Come over here. Come on.

382
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,599
You're behaving like children.
You could have torn him apart.

383
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:45,360
Are you hurt?

384
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,360
If you can't make a decision,
we will all sleep here.

385
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Hey, Mom.

386
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,329
Mook, what's wrong?

387
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,159
Mook, what's wrong?

388
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,440
Dad went into cardiac arrest.
The doctor is trying to save him.

389
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:47,809
Dad.

390
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,199
Dear, please hang in there.

391
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,639
Da, stay calm.

392
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,809
The doctor is trying to save him.

393
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,119
He will be alright.

394
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,480
Oak, Petch and I will fly home
right away. Get us tickets.

395
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:01,639
Alright, I'll handle it.

396
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Phone.

397
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
Oak, let me handle it.

398
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:11,880
You can take care of your friend.

399
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,039
- Mook.
- I'll pack my bag.

400
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:44,239
Come on.

401
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,519
Leave me. I'm not ready
to fight with you.

402
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,639
You don't have to do anything.
Just stay still.

403
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,840
- You can stay here. I will...
- Quiet.

404
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,840
Will my dad be okay?

405
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
I don't know.

406
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,719
Whatever will happen will happen.

407
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,199
You should be prepared.

408
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,119
I will help you pack up.

409
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,679
I'm flying home with you.

410
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,599
Mom, how is he?

411
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,159
They brought him back.

412
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,679
Did the doctor tell you
why his condition worsened?

413
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,760
There's something wrong
with Dad's brain.

414
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,599
Mook, Petch,

415
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,719
I have something
important to tell you.

416
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,400
We have to make a decision together.

417
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:36,440
Based on our examination,
it is confirmed that

418
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,679
Pethai's brain has stopped working.

419
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,599
He is being kept alive
by life support.

420
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,960
Clinically, he is considered dead.

421
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,159
Oh, Da.

422
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,199
Do you mean
he can't recover from this?

423
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:58,639
I'm sorry for your loss.

424
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,760
What I want to inform you is

425
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,960
Pethai is a registered organ donor.

426
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,400
The donation process can only
be continued with your consent.

427
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,639
To be frank,
you have to decide quickly

428
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,280
if you want to keep up the treatment
or respect the patient's wish.

429
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,639
So we have to decide if we want
to let him go or keep him alive.

430
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
That's right.

431
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,599
The decision is up to us

432
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:54,840
whether we wish to give our consent.

433
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:58,679
What's your opinion on this?

434
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,480
Mom.

435
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,440
I want Dad to stay with us.

436
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,880
This is too early.

437
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,679
I know.

438
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:15,400
I can't accept this either.

439
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,239
But I don't want to ignore his wish.

440
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,159
- Mom.
- Petch.

441
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,320
Can I have tonight
to make up my mind?

442
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,599
We still have time, don't we?

443
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,280
We still do.

444
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,840
But the doctor wants us
to decide quickly

445
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,639
before all of his organs fail.

446
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:01,239
Are you still qualified
to be an organ donor?

447
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,440
I'm not that old.

448
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,239
We can be an organ donor
until we're 65 years old.

449
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,039
I'm only 50.

450
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,960
Does Mom know about this?

451
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,199
She does. I just want you to know
in case something happens to me

452
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,880
because it's you, Mom, and Petch
who have to make the decision.

453
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,119
Dad, don't say something like that.

454
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,559
The future is unpredictable.

455
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,400
I just want you to be prepared.

456
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,000
But, if you have to decide some day,
I want you to think of my words.

457
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,800
If something happens to me,
if I have to leave this world,

458
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,519
and any part of me can save
the life of somebody,

459
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,800
who has their own family
just like I have you, Da and Petch,

460
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,039
and I can help them get back to
their family, I will do it.

461
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,719
Although I won't be
with you physically,

462
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,679
I will be alive
in someone else's body.

463
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,360
I want you to think that way.

464
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,960
It's my wish.

465
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:13,039
I hope you remember my words.

466
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,639
I remember everything you said.

467
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,480
But I'm afraid
that I can't live without you.

468
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:53,239
Why aren't you
by her side right now?

469
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,000
How could you let her go home alone?
You're useless.

470
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,320
I won't be able to help her anyway.

471
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,039
You could at least be there for her.

472
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,679
Listen to me.

473
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,880
Husband and wife are supposed to
be there for each other.

474
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:09,960
You stay together during
your joyous moments.

475
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,039
You hold each other's hand
during hardship.

476
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:13,920
You aren't supposed to do
what you're doing right now.

477
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,480
I'm giving her time
to be with her family.

478
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,559
You're her family too.

479
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,079
Whatever, you have to be
by her side immediately tomorrow.

480
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:28,719
Alright.

481
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:33,119
I will do it because you told me to.

482
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:37,159
Lan.

483
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:42,199
Do you know that our family
made it through our financial crisis

484
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,800
because we got help from Pethai?

485
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,880
Our families share a real bond.

486
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,599
How can we do nothing
when their family is struggling?

487
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,480
Listen to me.

488
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,159
You will take care of
Mook and her family

489
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,760
on behalf of me and your mother.

490
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,360
Or at least during this time.
Can you do that for me?

491
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:14,360
Beg me and I will do it.

492
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,079
Alright.

493
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,960
I beg you.

494
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:52,960
I want you to consent to
the organ donation.

495
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,559
Mook, don't you love him?
How can you let him die?

496
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:03,559
Dad left us, Petch.
The doctor declared it.

497
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,960
The doctor might have
made a mistake.

498
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,199
Should we move Dad to a new hospital

499
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,639
or find him a new doctor?
There must be a miracle.

500
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,480
Petch, there's no miracle.

501
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,960
The doctor checked several times.

502
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:20,679
Only once the results were clear
did he let me know.

503
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,119
Dad left us.

504
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,960
That's not true.

505
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,960
Petch.

506
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,440
Stop running away.

507
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:34,400
You have to be strong
and face reality.

508
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,599
- I don't want to listen to you.
- Petch.

509
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:39,360
Petch, Dad left us.

510
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:42,480
Let him go.

511
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:49,880
This is the last thing
we can do for him.

512
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:33,440
How did you get here?

513
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
I drove here.

514
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,519
You can drive back
if you're going to be annoying.

515
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,039
I'm not in the mood
to argue with you.

516
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,320
I wasn't being annoying.
I just answered your question.

517
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:55,159
Lan.

518
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:57,719
I just want to be left in peace.

519
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,119
Didn't you hear what I said?
Why are you still here?

520
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,239
You said you want to be left
in peace, not alone.

521
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:34,679
Where are you going?

522
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,800
I want to be alone in peace.

523
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,039
Don't go anywhere.

524
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,760
I promise I will be quiet
and won't disturb you.

525
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,800
I want you to add color
and graphic details in this scene.

526
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,840
Let me know when you've finished.
I'll take a look at it again.

527
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,159
Okay. Thanks, Boss.

528
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,280
If you're worried,
you should go to the hospital.

529
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:49,519
Staying here,
you can't concentrate on work.

530
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,039
I'm not worried.

531
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,920
But you keep looking at
Petch's desk every five seconds.

532
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:57,320
- I'm not.
- Stop.

533
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,119
Don't argue with me.
I've been watching you.

534
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,320
Are you this dedicated
when it comes to your work?

535
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:06,880
People's business is my business.

536
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:09,760
We don't have a lot of work today.

537
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:12,000
You can leave the office
if you want.

538
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,159
I will get back to work.

539
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:22,119
If you don't go,

540
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,719
then I'd like to take this day off.
I've finished all my work.

541
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
Wait.

542
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,840
Where are you going?

543
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,320
I'm going to see Petch.
I'm worried about her.

544
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,760
She has been through a lot.

545
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,840
As her mentor,
I have to take care of her.

546
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,320
Boss, where are you going?

547
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,599
I'm going to the hospital.

548
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,400
Do I have to tell you everything?
You're so clueless.

549
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,760
- Poom.
- Yes?

550
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,400
I heard that.

551
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,159
Don't worry about us.

552
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,159
We can take care of ourselves.

553
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,119
I will miss you a little though.

554
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,960
Dad, don't worry.

555
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:42,880
I will do my best
to take care of Mom and my sister.

556
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:50,559
I can take care of myself.
I won't need you.

557
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,599
Dad, I'm an adult now,
so don't worry about me.

558
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,239
When I make my own game,

559
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,119
I will create a character based on
you, and you will be the big boss.

560
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,400
Nobody will be able to beat you.

561
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,440
Would you like that?

562
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,119
I love you, Dad.

563
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:49,480
I love you, Dad.

564
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,320
Please rest in peace, Pethai.

565
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,400
Don't worry.

566
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,320
My family

567
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:50,599
will always be there for yours.

568
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,440
Although Mook and I fight a lot,

569
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:00,960
when she is in trouble,

570
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,639
I will stay by her side.

571
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,840
It's time to rest.

572
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:56,720
Rest well.

573
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,279
Don't worry about your family.

574
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,239
No matter what happens,

575
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,239
I will do your job for you.

576
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,119
Pethai.

577
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:17,720
We're a family.

578
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,720
You don't have to worry.

579
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:25,039
Lim and I
will take care of everything.

580
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:29,039
Rest in peace, Pethai.

581
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:00,199
Thank you, Pethai,

582
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:03,840
for always being there
for my family.

583
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:08,880
I will never forget what
you've done for me.

584
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:20,279
I don't have a father.

585
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:23,319
My mother didn't have time for me.

586
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:26,479
But you love me

587
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,680
and always treated me like a son.

588
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,119
I will keep your love for me
in my heart forever.

589
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:04,159
Goodbye, Dad.

590
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:11,880
I love you more than
anything in the world.

591
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,319
This is where we part.

592
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:24,119
Start your journey before me.

593
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,359
And one day I will follow you.

594
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,199
I love you.

595
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:19,649
Mom.

596
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,239
- Mom.
- Oh dear.

597
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,880
Rut.

598
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,960
When you're with me,

599
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:21,760
you don't have to
make yourself look tough.

600
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,159
I'm not breaking our rule

601
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:55,319
that says we won't date
the same woman.

602
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,800
You said it yourself that Mook
doesn't mean anything to you.

603
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:07,529
Lan.

604
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:15,479
Where is Mook?

605
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,800
I don't know.

606
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,529
How can you say you don't know?

607
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,880
During this time,
you should be by her side,

608
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:25,760
consoling her, reassuring her.

609
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,800
And why should I do that?
It's not my place.

610
01:17:29,569 --> 01:17:31,000
You're her husband.

611
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:33,569
A husband who doesn't love her.

612
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:36,649
So I don't have a duty to fulfill.

613
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,079
Lan.

614
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,079
Still, you shouldn't be this unkind.

615
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:46,479
You two grew up together.

616
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:49,920
Can't you at least be there for her?

617
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,359
Dear, take it easy.

618
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:55,039
Lan, look.

619
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,529
Mook is mourning.

620
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:00,960
I want you to be by her side
and console her.

621
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:04,199
I'm worried about her.
I don't want her to be all alone.

622
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,920
She isn't all alone,
so don't worry about that.

623
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:13,279
He may do a better job
than a cruel man like me.

624
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:18,159
I'm not needed here.

625
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,319
Lan! Lan!

626
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:31,359
Dear.

627
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:33,800
Who did he mean?

628
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,720
How would I know?
I'm just as clueless as you are.

629
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,960
Rut, I'm sorry for
losing control of myself.

630
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,569
I told you before.

631
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:07,720
You don't have to be strong
around me.

632
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:13,399
I just want to be there for you
when you feel vulnerable.

633
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,439
Thank you so much.

634
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,279
You're welcome.

635
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:25,960
Although you wish I were Lan.

636
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:30,399
No, I didn't mean it like that.

637
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,720
Of course.

638
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,359
I understand how you feel.

639
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:51,399
Time will help you get through this.

640
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,119
I believe you.

641
01:20:00,649 --> 01:20:02,840
I will get through this.

642
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:05,569
Petch.

643
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Petch.

644
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,079
Poom.

645
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:26,920
What should I do?
I don't want to cry.

646
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,119
I don't want Dad to worry.
I want to be strong.

647
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,239
I don't want anyone
to worry about me.

648
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:34,800
But it's really hard.

649
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:39,720
I can't hold back the tears.

650
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,649
Crying doesn't make you weak.

651
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:51,479
It's an emotional expression.

652
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:55,079
You are allowed to cry.

653
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:38,319
Rut.

654
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,840
Nampetch.

655
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:25,119
I know you're upset.

656
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,760
But you have to
pull yourself together.

657
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,680
Crybaby.

658
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:50,439
There you go.

659
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,960
(Nuch is calling)

660
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:07,649
Mook will stay
with her mother tonight.

661
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,159
Why are you telling me this?
I don't want to know.

662
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:16,199
I just want you to know
because you will be alone tonight.

663
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:26,039
Good. Maybe then I will get
some peace and quiet.

664
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:30,399
Since I married her,
my life has been in chaos.

665
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:34,119
She will be away for a few days.

666
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:37,079
You will get to fully enjoy
some peace and quiet.

667
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,119
Tell me the truth.

668
01:25:39,609 --> 01:25:41,399
Don't you worry about her?

669
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:43,119
Why should I?

670
01:25:43,529 --> 01:25:47,800
I don't care what happens to her
or how she feels.

671
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:51,920
I told you before. What happens
to her doesn't concern me.

672
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,239
You're a real jerk.

673
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,840
Rut, are you insulting me?

674
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,079
I'm telling you what I see.

675
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:02,479
You are mean to her
to keep her away from you.

676
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,760
It's actually a good thing
that you're mean to her.

677
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,609
The more you hate her,

678
01:26:11,239 --> 01:26:13,960
the greater chance I have
of making her fall in love with me.

679
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:18,479
Did duckling put you under a spell
and cause you to lose your mind?

680
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:24,079
You've gotten involved with her when
we don't know if she is the culprit.

681
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,279
You're setting yourself up
for disappointment.

682
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,880
Thanks for the warning.
But I'm not scared.

683
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:31,479
I will uncover the truth from her.

684
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,079
Now, you...

685
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,279
(Nuch is calling)

686
01:26:42,609 --> 01:26:45,760
You should uncover the truth
from Treenuch and stop running away.

687
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:49,960
- I'm not running away.
- Then what are you doing?

688
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,529
Do you think I don't know
that you readily agreed to the trip

689
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,239
because you wanted to
run away from her?

690
01:26:56,199 --> 01:26:58,680
You should ask yourself
how you feel about her.

691
01:26:59,479 --> 01:27:02,529
So you can stop getting angry
when I hit the nail on the head.

692
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,279
Are you done?
If you're done, shut up.

693
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,039
I want to be alone.

694
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:10,479
Oh.

695
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,039
I will stop pretending
to be your boyfriend.

696
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:18,039
Everybody knows you're lying.

697
01:27:18,529 --> 01:27:20,960
Nobody will buy it,
except those who don't know you.

698
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,399
I will begin my own game.

699
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,319
And I'm sure that in this game

700
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:29,840
I will be the winner.

701
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:36,560
Sure. Do whatever you want.

702
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:06,079
I want to be close to you.

703
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,520
Do you miss me?

704
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:10,920
I will give you another chance.

705
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:13,439
Let me know if you change
your mind about Mook.

706
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,279
Our rule is
don't love the same girl.

707
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,239
You told me to stop running away.

708
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,680
I've asked myself

709
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,920
and got my answer.

710
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,159
Nuch is important to me.

711
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:27,279
From now on I will pursue you.

712
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:31,560
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

713
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,680
Then I will give you another story.

714
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,119
You've been surrounded on all sides.
