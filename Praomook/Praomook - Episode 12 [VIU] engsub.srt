1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,759
I don't think it's a robbery.

4
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,479
I think it's a cover-up.

5
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Win?

6
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,530
Rawin could be the attacker.

7
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,639
I will do everything to make sure
you don't get together with her.

8
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
I don't want to have a sly man
like you as my brother-in-law.

9
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,120
Did you do this?
Did you leak the news?

10
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I didn't do it.

11
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,599
- Lan.
- Ow, Lan.

12
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,520
Do you let a woman
come before your friend?

13
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,680
If my friend is crazy,
I have to take her side.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Get lost.

15
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Rut!

16
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,319
I believe you didn't leak the news.

17
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,599
Why do you believe people easily?

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,960
You aren't stupid.

19
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,520
You wouldn't leak the news
and ruin your reputation.

20
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
What?

21
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,919
You're a DJ. You have a lot of fans.

22
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,879
You wouldn't leak the news
to make yourself look bad.

23
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm glad you believe me.

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,439
Unlike the man I grew up with,
he didn't even listen to me.

25
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,960
He is close-minded with you,

26
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,520
while I'm open-minded.

27
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,639
Excuse me. I should go.

28
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,839
Mook didn't leak the news.

29
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,920
You're mad at the wrong person.

30
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,319
Mook, I made breakfast for you.

31
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,680
Thank you.

32
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,879
Lan, have breakfast with us.

33
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Wait, Lan.

34
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,480
Let's eat.

35
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,480
Don't mind him.

36
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,759
(Future Vice President Of Furniture
Manufacturer, Chalantorn, Is Taken)

37
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,759
They look perfect together.

38
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,759
Being on the news
is actually a good thing.

39
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,959
Now people will know
that they're married.

40
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,079
Hm?

41
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
It may be good,

42
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,680
- but...
- Dad, you broke our agreement.

43
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,480
What did I do?

44
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,279
You leaked the news
about my marriage.

45
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,199
No way, I didn't leak the news.

46
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,040
I was wondering what backlash
Mook could be facing right now.

47
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,480
Don't you worry about me?

48
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,839
Why should I?
You aren't affected by this.

49
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,759
Now that I think about it,

50
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,519
people knowing you're married
might be a good thing.

51
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
Now you will behave
and won't try to see another woman,

52
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,040
especially your ex.

53
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,199
From now on, you will consider
your situation before you act.

54
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,519
What situation?
Do you mean as your son

55
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,839
or the vice president position
that I never asked for?

56
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,600
- Are you challenging me?
- Yes, I'm challenging you.

57
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,839
Enough, both of you.

58
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
- I didn't start it.
- Right, I started it.

59
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Stop.

60
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,800
Lan, your dad said
he didn't leak the news.

61
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,759
So stop being angry at him.

62
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,040
About your work,
you're in charge of a project now.

63
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
So get it done.

64
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,879
I didn't teach you to be
irresponsible. Do your duty.

65
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,360
- Now, you.
- What?

66
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,319
Stop ordering your son around.

67
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,680
Be nice to him. Can you do that?

68
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,480
But he started...

69
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Are you arguing with me?

70
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,319
Absolutely not.

71
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,000
- Are we clear?
- Crystal clear.

72
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,639
- Sit down.
- Yes, ma'am.

73
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,800
Lan, have breakfast with us.

74
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,319
- Ja, could you get a bowl for him?
- Of course.

75
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,000
Here is your breakfast.

76
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,639
For you, Lan.

77
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,639
Did your mother follow us?

78
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Not yet.

79
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,639
Alright.

80
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,399
You have to come to work
with me today.

81
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,090
We made a deal, didn't we?

82
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,240
Once you're married for a year,
I will leave you alone.

83
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240
But before that,
I can do whatever I want with you.

84
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,210
If you think I'm so irresponsible,

85
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,960
why did you assign me a big project?
Aren't you scared I will ruin it?

86
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,210
I am scared.

87
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,840
But if it can make you grow up
and become more responsible,

88
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,090
I'm willing to risk it.

89
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,519
You have to come to work with me.

90
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,450
- I will...
- What are you guys talking about?

91
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,639
Nothing, dear.

92
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,330
I just asked him
if he wants to come to work.

93
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,330
- That's good.
- Sure.

94
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,559
- Lan, talking like adults is good.
- Right.

95
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,090
I wonder why you two
always act like children.

96
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,039
- Dear.
- Hm?

97
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,159
It's time to go.

98
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,639
Lan, it's time to go to work.

99
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,879
Go.

100
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
Okay. Bye, Mom.

101
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,450
See you later, dear.

102
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,399
Alright?

103
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,639
Do you think this can stop me?

104
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,919
(Sorry, girls. Chalantorn is taken.)

105
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,399
I refuse to lose to you, Praomook.

106
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,919
Pity. If I were there, I'd help you
kick him into the pool three times.

107
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,639
Always irrational,
what kind of man is he?

108
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,039
I lose my mind
whenever I'm around him.

109
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Listen, just give Rut a chance.

110
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,519
He is handsome, cool, smart,

111
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,080
and more importantly,
he has feelings for you.

112
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,759
Stop trying to encourage me.

113
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,000
Why? Does he make you feel things?

114
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,440
He doesn't make me feel things.

115
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,440
Besides, now isn't the time
to encourage me to fall in love.

116
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,720
We have a bigger problem
ahead of us.

117
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,399
I really want to know
who leaked the news.

118
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
Could it have been Lim?

119
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,840
Uncle is a man of his word.
I think it was someone else.

120
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,559
Find the person who leaked the news
about their marriage ASAP.

121
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Alright.

122
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,399
The photo is very high quality.

123
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,480
I think it's from one of the guests.

124
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,440
I won't let you become the bad guy.

125
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,799
I will do everything to make sure
you don't get together with her.

126
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,480
I don't want to have a sly man
like you as my brother-in-law.

127
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,399
I want it as soon as possible.

128
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,720
Of course. I will find them
as soon as possible.

129
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,159
Good morning, vice president's wife.

130
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,879
Good morning, Treenuch.

131
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,720
News spreads fast as usual.

132
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,960
Do you think announcing your status
will make him yours?

133
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,519
It's up to Lan to decide.
Others have no say in this.

134
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
Right, an outsider like you
has no say in this.

135
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,480
It's between husband and wife.

136
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,960
You should mind your manners.

137
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,679
You don't want to be condemned
for trying to take my husband.

138
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,000
A mistress is always guilty.

139
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,679
Mook.

140
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,559
Good morning.

141
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,879
Good morning.

142
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,399
I've been looking for you.

143
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,039
Is there something wrong?

144
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm concerned about the news.

145
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,720
Come on. Let's talk in my office.

146
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,679
Sure.

147
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,960
Lan.

148
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,039
Lan.

149
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,639
Come with me.

150
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,399
She wants people to know who she is.
She wants to be important.

151
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,279
Next she will take everything
from my family.

152
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,720
Take it easy.

153
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,080
She has always kept
a low profile at work.

154
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,879
Keeping a low profile
doesn't mean she isn't greedy.

155
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,840
I have to get rid of her.

156
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Your parents adore her.

157
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
You have to be very careful
with what you do.

158
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,279
I'm their daughter.
Blood is thicker than water.

159
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,440
You have to make her
reveal her true colors.

160
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,600
How will I do that?
She hasn't given me a chance.

161
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,799
Just buy her with money.

162
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,919
I have no idea how it got leaked.

163
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,600
However, from now on,

164
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,519
I want you two to act properly.

165
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,679
I will act the same way as always.

166
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,399
Are you done?

167
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,559
Lan.

168
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,039
You have to do
your duty as a husband.

169
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,559
She deserves that
after what she has done for you.

170
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,080
Since she came back into my life,
it's only been chaos.

171
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,879
It's you who created all the chaos.

172
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,360
Am I supposed to be
in debt to her forever?

173
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,919
I don't want anything from you.

174
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,399
Are you saying
you're a good, selfless person?

175
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,679
Come on, Lan.

176
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,559
Will you stop being sarcastic?

177
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
And you don't have to
make yourself feel grateful to her.

178
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
Just act properly

179
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,559
as a good husband should.

180
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,919
I don't want to.

181
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,240
Besides, I'm sick of this madness.

182
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,559
I consider marrying this woman
a terrible misfortune.

183
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,200
- Lan!
- I don't need anyone to help me.

184
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,320
Do whatever you want.

185
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,960
My only job is to be
your wife for a year.

186
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,159
I don't care what happens
to you after that.

187
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,159
Excuse me.
I should get back to work.

188
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
What?

189
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,360
Come on. This is a mess.

190
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,879
A total mess.

191
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,279
Practice what you preach.

192
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,120
I will.

193
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,170
I told you to stay away from him.
Didn't you understand me?

194
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,680
I did. I just didn't want to
listen to you.

195
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,559
Don't test me.

196
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,119
I'm not testing you.

197
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,039
I want him.

198
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,799
How dare you say you want
another man in front of your lover?

199
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,359
Calm down.

200
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,410
I have a proposal.

201
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm going to make Lan mine

202
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,890
and you're going to
make Mook your mistress,

203
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,519
forcing them to get a divorce.
Let's work together.

204
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,279
I can handle Praomook

205
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,720
without having to rely on anyone.

206
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
I haven't finished.

207
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,920
If I have Lan,
I will keep us a secret,

208
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,960
and you will have her
and the benefit of their divorce,

209
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,799
and continue to be
Lak's loving husband.

210
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,440
What if I don't agree to this?

211
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,799
Then I can't promise
this won't reach Lak's ears.

212
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,680
If Lak finds out about us,
I will ruin your life.

213
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Why don't we find out
whose life will be ruined first?

214
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,759
If we work together,
it's a win-win for both of us.

215
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,519
Just say yes.

216
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Yes.

217
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,410
I have to find out who you are

218
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,559
and end this madness.

219
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
What did you find?

220
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,960
I figured out

221
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,319
who leaked the news of the wedding.

222
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,599
Go on.

223
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,920
Promise me you will stay calm

224
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,960
and be rational.

225
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,119
Who is it?

226
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,319
The person who leaked the news is...

227
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,000
You leaked the news
about your sister's wedding.

228
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,920
You're accusing me.
Do you have proof?

229
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,599
I wouldn't say it without proof.

230
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,920
You know what Poom and I
are capable of.

231
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,279
It's not hard to discover
the identity of an online source.

232
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,519
I will give you a chance.

233
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,079
Will you admit it,

234
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,519
or do I have to get it out of you?

235
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,799
- Well...
- If you choose the latter,

236
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,799
besides getting caught,
you will be forced out of my life

237
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,170
because I don't like cowards.

238
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:33,000
Alright, I did it.

239
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,759
Why did you do it?

240
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,200
To stop you

241
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,079
from doing immoral things
and going after a married woman.

242
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,890
I warned you but you didn't listen.

243
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,960
Now I will let society stop you,

244
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,920
so you can get a hold of yourself.

245
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
I have a hold of myself.

246
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,680
My actions have been thought out.
I've done nothing wrong.

247
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,640
It's you who are being irrational.

248
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,799
I thought this through.

249
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,240
Have you thought about

250
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,680
how it affects your sister?

251
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,160
You want me to do the right thing,

252
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,599
but what you did isn't right.

253
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,440
If your good intentions
hurt Mook and Lan,

254
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,960
I don't want it.

255
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Rut...

256
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
I'll give you some time to consider

257
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,440
if what I said is right.

258
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,839
One more thing.

259
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,359
Even though the news was leaked,
I won't stop.

260
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,440
I will win her heart.

261
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,240
Your childish plan

262
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,920
can't stop me.

263
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,279
Stupid rain, are you mocking me?

264
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,839
Poom, was I so wrong?

265
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,279
Yes.

266
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,519
I didn't think it'd be
such a big deal.

267
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm sorry.

268
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
For what?

269
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,119
For

270
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,039
offending you

271
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,680
and leaking the news.

272
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:42,039
I accept your apology
for offending me.

273
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,279
However, for leaking the news,

274
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,680
you don't owe me an apology.

275
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,559
What you should do is to
admit to Lan and your sister

276
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,839
that you leaked the news.

277
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,200
- But I...
- I hope you aren't a coward.

278
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,720
I'm not a coward.
I always own up to my mistakes.

279
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,759
Well, I...

280
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,359
I leaked the news
about your wedding.

281
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,400
Did someone tell you to do it?

282
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,519
I did it on my own.
Mook wasn't involved.

283
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,279
I apologize for not asking
for your opinion first and

284
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,279
for the bad timing.

285
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,920
But I won't apologize
for leaking the news.

286
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
Nampetch.

287
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,880
You said I should
own up to what I did.

288
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,640
So I will say how I feel.

289
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
Whether it's on the news or not,

290
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,279
your wedding happened.

291
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Lan.

292
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,960
Are you done?

293
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Yes.

294
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
When we end the marriage,
please tell people about that too.

295
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,759
Hi, Mom.

296
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,319
You know
the reason for this marriage.

297
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
We all know how it will end.

298
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,880
Why can't you let it end quietly?

299
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm sorry, Mom.

300
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry, Mook.

301
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Saying sorry doesn't mean it's over.

302
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,400
What do you want me to do?

303
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,079
What you should do
is try to learn from this.

304
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,960
Think before you act

305
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,160
because you can't undo what you did.

306
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,519
This will be my lesson.

307
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm going to go to my room.

308
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,359
Petch.

309
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,400
Mom, I'm really okay.

310
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,640
Now that it became public,

311
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,559
after this is over, you will be
the one who has the most to lose.

312
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,160
You also got hurt for helping Lan.

313
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,640
I don't know
if the prophecy is true.

314
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,960
But what scares me right now
is that you may get hurt worse.

315
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,240
It was just a coincidence.

316
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,400
What if it happens again?

317
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,759
I'm scared you will be in danger.

318
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,799
You don't have to do so much
for me and your sister.

319
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,440
If you can't do it,
if you aren't happy,

320
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,079
you can end it. I won't blame you.

321
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,640
What about this house?

322
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,200
Your father isn't with us anymore.

323
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,839
I don't know why
we should keep the house.

324
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,599
My children are the most
precious thing to me right now.

325
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,440
If you are unhappy,

326
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,319
I don't want you to go through it.

327
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,039
I agree. Why should you endure it?

328
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,599
Let's find another solution.

329
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,559
I can't let it go, Mom.

330
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,759
This house was Dad's.

331
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,079
He built it for us
to live comfortably.

332
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,000
As the eldest daughter,

333
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,559
I will never let go of this house.

334
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,519
I can keep going, Mom.

335
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Alright.

336
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,759
If one day you can't keep going,

337
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,119
whatever your decision may be,

338
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,519
I'll always be there for you.

339
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,920
Thank you, Mom.

340
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,839
You don't have to worry.

341
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,119
Right now I can go through anything.

342
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,559
- Lan!
- Why?

343
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,279
Did you think I would push you?

344
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes.

345
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,039
I wouldn't do that.

346
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,640
If I were to get back at you,
I'd rather kick you.

347
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,440
You can try.

348
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Rut.

349
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,079
I've made my decision.

350
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,640
I'm going to end this madness.

351
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,839
What do you mean?

352
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,079
The whole thing isn't caused
by my misfortune.

353
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,359
He caused it.

354
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,720
The man who attacked me
and ruined my life.

355
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,200
That makes sense.

356
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,400
What will you do next?

357
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm tired of being the prey.

358
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,799
From now on I will be the hunter.

359
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Will you help me?

360
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,799
Absolutely.

361
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,960
From today,

362
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,440
I will stop playing everyone's game

363
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,319
and show them who's boss.

364
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
So,

365
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,720
you've gotten attacked since
you moved back home to Thailand.

366
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,039
This means your return
has an impact on the culprit.

367
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,680
Possibly.

368
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,809
At first, I suspected Duckling.

369
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,159
But if it was just
to create a situation,

370
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,519
she wouldn't almost kill me.

371
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,440
If you drop your prejudice,

372
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,719
you will realize that
she walked into you by accident.

373
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,239
I know.

374
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,769
You have to figure out

375
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,960
who could be at a disadvantage and
have a lot to lose from your return.

376
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,480
You don't know what you're doing,
but Dad thinks you do.

377
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:44,719
He tries to make you be in charge
when you're incapable.

378
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,960
Can you go back to living abroad?

379
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
My sister.

380
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,329
What do you mean?

381
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,920
Nothing.

382
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,639
I still haven't figured out
who has a lot to lose.

383
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,119
I think the man who attacked you
at your condo could be Rawin.

384
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,360
This is his background.

385
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,809
He comes from
a middle-class background.

386
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,769
He has known your sister
since university.

387
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,079
Is he her friend?

388
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,920
The person who'd benefit the most
if something were to happen is...

389
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,920
For now, let's just say
Win is our prime suspect.

390
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:43,960
We will make him reveal his
true colors as quickly as possible.

391
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,599
As for his motive,
I will discover that myself.

392
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,079
I need to look at something.

393
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,639
Poom.

394
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,880
You suspect his sister, don't you?

395
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,329
Yes.

396
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,000
I think he feels the same way.

397
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,199
If it were true,
what do you think he would do?

398
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,119
For now, let him
try to absorb the fact

399
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,960
that his sister
is our prime suspect.

400
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,329
You have to figure out

401
00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:01,559
who could be at a disadvantage and
have a lot to lose from your return.

402
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,679
Please let it be anyone

403
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,769
but her.

404
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,519
Stop drinking already. You're drunk.

405
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:22,809
It's gone. Now go to bed.

406
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,679
What are you doing?

407
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,920
You're so nosy.

408
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,679
You said you don't care if I die.

409
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:55,519
It's not like I want to.
I just can't stand looking at you.

410
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,079
If you're stressed, go to bed
and figure it out when you wake up.

411
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,719
Don't drink like a fish.

412
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,289
Did you call me a fish?

413
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,769
I can do worse.
Do you want to try me?

414
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,119
No.

415
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,639
Go to bed.
I think you've had enough.

416
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,809
I'm not drunk.

417
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,679
See? I'm completely fine.

418
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:16,880
Lan!

419
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,809
I'm okay. Look at me.

420
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,840
Go to bed. I'll walk with you.

421
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:27,769
No.

422
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:30,000
I want to get drunk.

423
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,960
Get drunk and forget everything.

424
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,519
Do you know how much my life sucks?

425
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,599
It sucks so much I wish
I'd fall asleep and never wake up.

426
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,329
- You can't think like that.
- Yes, I can.

427
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,159
Why can't I?

428
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,400
My life is funny, don't you think?

429
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,559
I was attacked by somebody
I don't even know.

430
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,840
Besides getting hurt,
I was forced to marry you as well.

431
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,400
I was forced
to do a job I don't like.

432
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,639
My father controls
everything in my life.

433
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,480
He wants me to work for him,
but my sister doesn't.

434
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,960
She even thinks I'm going to take
everything from her.

435
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:14,960
This one wants one thing.

436
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:17,119
The other wants something else.

437
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,599
What do I have to do
to please everyone?

438
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:22,809
Lan.

439
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,159
It's pitiful to be me.

440
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,960
No one cares how I feel.

441
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,519
They act like I feel nothing,
like I'm heartless.

442
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,880
But I feel it all.

443
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,159
I feel angry.

444
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,480
I feel sad.

445
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,880
I care how you feel.

446
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,719
That's not true.

447
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,719
You're selfish. You want to beat me.

448
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
That's right.

449
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,559
I don't know

450
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,400
if I should or shouldn't love you.

451
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,809
I know that my parents
used the prophecy as an excuse.

452
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,039
They've wanted to
set us up for a long time now.

453
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,440
I can't love you.

454
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,360
If I love you,
then my parents get their way.

455
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,559
But to hate you,

456
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,329
I can't bring myself to do that.

457
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:59,159
What about you? How do you feel?

458
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,329
You don't have to care how I feel.

459
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,519
Answer me.

460
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,440
If you don't answer me,

461
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,440
I will make you.

462
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,960
Lan, you're so drunk that
you don't know what you're doing.

463
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,960
Let me get you to bed.

464
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,159
No.

465
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,440
Answer me first.

466
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,159
If you don't, I will kiss you.

467
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,480
Lan, hey.

468
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,039
Lan, don't do this.

469
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,329
Lan!

470
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,960
Lan, let go.

471
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,679
Enough. I'll get you to bed.

472
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,719
Rut, you interrupted us.

473
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,329
Mook, go to bed.
I'll take care of him.

474
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,880
Hold on. She hasn't answered me yet.

475
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,769
Lan, that's enough.

476
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,119
I came to see Mook.

477
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,360
I also brought breakfast.

478
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,760
I came to see

479
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,239
everyone.

480
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,480
Sorry.

481
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:21,559
Here. Wear this

482
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,960
so you don't spread the virus.

483
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,679
I'm fine. I just sneezed.

484
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
Wear it.

485
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,519
If you don't wear it, go home.

486
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,639
Come here.

487
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,239
Ow! Rut, that hurt.

488
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,880
Worry about yourself

489
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:26,000
before you worry about other people.

490
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,480
Grouchy old man.

491
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,519
I heard that.

492
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,320
Lan is out.

493
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,679
He left early this morning.

494
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,360
Where did he go?

495
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,559
He can go wherever he wants.
I don't care.

496
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,679
Here you go.

497
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,920
I'm thirsty. My throat hurts.

498
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,440
I don't think it's a love triangle.

499
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,280
It's a quadrangle.

500
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,159
Win, it's me.

501
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,800
Oh, Lan.

502
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:16,239
I'm sorry. I was startled.

503
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,719
It's fine.
It's my fault for startling you.

504
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,320
If it weren't me,
you'd finish the job, right?

505
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,880
You're exaggerating.

506
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:30,199
Anyway, how can I help you?

507
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,800
I want to talk to you
about our project.

508
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:36,079
Okay.

509
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,400
I'm still inexperienced.
I will need your advice.

510
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:42,880
I hope we can work well together.

511
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,360
Of course. I will do my best.

512
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,000
This project will prove to
the board and everyone

513
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,119
that you deserve
to be vice president.

514
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,320
Is it him?

515
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,760
Make it quick.
I'm in the middle of something.

516
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,079
I'll do the project I got assigned.
After that, I will quit.

517
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,079
You're still stubborn.

518
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,679
Is that all you want to say?
I've got work to do.

519
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:36,119
I don't want to be the heir.

520
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:39,880
I don't want to replace you.

521
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:41,960
I will build everything on my own.

522
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,960
Anybody can say that.

523
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,800
I'm serious.

524
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,239
I hope you can do as you say.

525
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,760
I hope you can do as you say.

526
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:39,599
Lan.

527
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:45,639
Nuch.

528
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,920
What's wrong? You look troubled.

529
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,119
I'm a little worried about work.

530
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
If you're troubled,
we can go somewhere quiet and talk.

531
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,360
I want to discuss
something with you.

532
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,119
But if you're not okay with that,
we can go to your office instead.

533
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:17,159
I'm fine with it.

534
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,320
Let's go somewhere else.
I'm tired of this place.

535
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Okay.

536
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
Lan!

537
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,719
What's gotten into you?

538
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,440
That man on a bike
tried to shoot you.

539
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:22,519
I'm at the front of the building.

540
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,239
I guess I imagined it.

541
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,400
Are you so desperate to stop us
that you have to lie like that?

542
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,679
Don't you think that's too much?

543
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,119
What if you scare someone to death?

544
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,679
I wasn't lying.

545
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,880
Forget it.

546
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,760
What's up with you?

547
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,519
I don't care what you do with him.

548
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,960
Please give me another chance
to develop the game.

549
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:19,719
If I don't say yes,

550
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,119
I will lose my chance to see
your exciting game.

551
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,000
I will give you one last chance.

552
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,280
Thank you.

553
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,119
I promise I will do my best.

554
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:41,280
Now get back to work.

555
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,199
There's one more thing.

556
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,320
We will keep our professional
and personal lives separate.

557
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,360
If you're upset with me,
don't take it out on my work.

558
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,960
Do we have a deal?

559
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,920
- Deal.
- Deal.

560
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,599
Poom, Rut let me
work on my game again.

561
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,679
Awesome.

562
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
I said exactly what you told me.

563
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,239
It's clear and to the point.

564
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,360
As expected from his favorite
secretary, you really know him.

565
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,480
Of course, I know everything.

566
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,719
- Good job.
- Sure.

567
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,079
Do you know
what I have in mind right now?

568
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,360
What is it, Boss?

569
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,559
I want a new secretary.

570
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,280
The old one knows too much.

571
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,599
Petch, come on,
let's get back to work.

572
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,119
Right, let's get back to work.

573
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,840
- Petch.
- Hm?

574
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You have a temperature.

575
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,280
A little. I should be fine after
taking some medicine. Don't worry.

576
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,159
Let's go.

577
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,920
Let's get back to work
before a storm blows up.

578
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,119
- Come on.
- Alright.

579
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,039
Nuch is going to do
media planning for us.

580
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,559
It's a pleasure to work with you.

581
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,320
Of course.

582
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,000
Lan told me about your work.

583
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,119
I will be very efficient
with media planning.

584
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,320
I believe he will choose
what's best for us.

585
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,079
Shall we begin?

586
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,960
Sure.

587
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,480
Even the news can't stop them.

588
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,960
(Come to Rut's office right now.
Treenuch is with Lan here.)

589
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,960
(Mook)

590
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,199
Mook, I feel sick.
Can you pick me up?

591
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,079
This is our media usage and budget
that I've planned.

592
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:16,760
I'll leave you two to discuss it.

593
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,400
I have to check with
the graphic team.

594
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:21,719
Hm?

595
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,960
Come on, Poom. Everyone is waiting.

596
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:28,639
- I'll leave it to you, Nuch.
- Of course.

597
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:42,239
Let's look at our plan.

598
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:49,360
Boss, do you have an appointment?

599
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,360
Did I miss something?

600
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,280
I see. An imaginary appointment.

601
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,360
I'm at the glass stairs.
Where are you?

602
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:04,239
Wait right there. I'll walk to you.

603
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,679
Okay.

604
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,079
Mook, I have a headache.

605
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:29,719
Did you take any medicine yet?

606
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,960
I haven't requested sick leave yet.

607
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,920
Follow me.

608
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,559
I'm glad you trust me
with your important project.

609
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,320
You're perfect for the job.

610
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:00,199
Just the job?

611
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:04,280
Can it be more?

612
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,440
If it can, what will you do?

613
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:32,000
I will free you from Praomook.

614
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,760
On one condition.

615
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,679
Come with me.

616
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,960
If you want your life back,
don't mind her.

617
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,360
That way, you will be able
to move forward.

618
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,719
I'm really okay.

619
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,880
If you aren't okay,
you don't have to force yourself.

620
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:39,519
Boss.

621
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,559
I feel much better.

622
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Alright.

623
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:06,199
Here you are.
I've been looking for you.

624
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:07,599
Hi, Mook.

625
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:12,159
Let's go home, Mook.

626
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,360
See you later.

627
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,719
See you.

628
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,480
(Lak)

629
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:40,719
I'll be right back.

630
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:04,079
Hello, Lak.

631
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,079
I want to know what Lan
has planned for the project.

632
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,880
I need you to find out.

633
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:11,840
Why do you want to know?

634
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,559
Do I need a reason
to inquire about my brother?

635
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,119
You're right,
but I've got nothing for you.

636
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:28,079
If you find out anything,
let me know immediately.

637
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Sure.

638
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:44,360
Look into Treenuch right away.

639
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Yes, Boss.

640
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,360
How much can you trust Treenuch?

641
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,320
Fifty percent.

642
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,760
I don't think you should trust her.

643
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,480
If we work together,
it's a win-win for both of us.

644
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:14,519
Just say yes.

645
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,840
Yes.

646
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,239
You never know
what people actually think.

647
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,079
Those who seem friendly
could be worse than you think.

648
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,159
I know what to do.

649
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,360
Don't worry.

650
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,800
What would you like me to do?
Should I tell Lak?

651
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,239
This isn't enough to incriminate
Rawin for fraud.

652
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,960
Watch him and wait for my order.

653
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,119
Of course.

654
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,360
Why didn't you do anything
when you saw them together?

655
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,920
What do you want me to do?

656
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,840
Yell at them
and say that he is mine?

657
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,239
Anything but
surrender to that woman.

658
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:19,529
It's your right.

659
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,960
Chasing after someone
who will never love you back

660
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,920
is painful and tiring.

661
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,569
Thank you for helping me
see the two of them together.

662
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,079
It may be time to make my decision.

663
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,720
Hey, you're back.

664
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:52,399
What are you talking about?
It looks fun.

665
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:05,800
Are you okay?

666
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,319
I'm still okay.

667
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:46,399
You two have matured.

668
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,960
Back then, you were happy
every time you saw him.

669
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:52,649
Was I?

670
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:57,159
You even counted the days.

671
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:04,319
Are you still happy
when you're with him?

672
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,119
Whatever reason you have
for marrying him,

673
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,199
I respect your decision.

674
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,399
But don't neglect
your own happiness.

675
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,529
If living in this house
means sacrificing your happiness,

676
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:42,159
I'd rather lose it.

677
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,960
When it's time to make a decision,

678
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:50,159
you can let yourself come first.

679
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,920
What do you want to talk about?

680
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:47,199
It's about our agreement.

681
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:50,439
Well,

682
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:53,399
I want your advice.

683
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:57,199
If I end it...

684
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,720
(Lan)

685
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:14,159
What were you saying?

686
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,439
Well, I...

687
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,840
Dear, come here quickly.

688
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,760
Dear.

689
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,159
Dear, what's wrong?

690
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:40,239
It's Lan.

691
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:43,079
He's launched his own company.

692
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:45,649
My son looks so smart.

693
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,439
Much is an application
where goods from all over the world

694
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:54,199

695

696
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:12,569
A real-time marketplace

Buyers and sellers can
communicate directly.

698

We also offer translation service.
With a single tap,

699
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,720

704
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,680
distance, speed, and safety.

705
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:47,399
So you may rest assured

706
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,649
that wherever you are in the world,

707
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,649
you can order products
from a different country

708
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,880
to your own country
swiftly and safely.

709
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,159
Dear, it has everything.

710
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:04,359
Mook, did you know about this?

711
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:07,680
No, I didn't.

712
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,119
Is LS Design partnered with L&R?

713
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,840
This company was found by me
and Marut, CEO of Mars Wiz.

714
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,800
What about your position
as vice president at LS Design?

715
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,880
I've decided to step down
from that position.

716
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:42,079
However, if LS Design would like to
enter the e-commerce market,

717
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,319
my company is ready to
provide assistance.

718
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:09,680
Dear, take it easy.
Don't be mad at him.

719
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:11,720
You need to keep
your blood pressure down.

720
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,569
Congratulations.

721
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Here.

722
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,039
Are you ready for the consequences?

723
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:48,159
I'm ready.

724
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:11,649
Hey, Dad.

725
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:15,319
Come home right now.

726
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:29,529
Lan,

727
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:31,760
let me go with you.

728
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,399
I want to handle it on my own.

729
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,039
If I can't deal with this,

730
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:41,920
how will I deal with
something bigger?

731
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,199
Have you gone crazy?

732
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,399
Why did you announce
that you're quitting?

733
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,680
Have you thought about
the consequences of your actions?

734
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,000
I chose the best option
for everybody.

735
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:23,529
The best option for you.

736
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,960
You only care about yourself.

737
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:28,720
Have you considered
how people around you may feel?

738
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:32,399
I'm selfish like you.

739
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:34,479
We're different.

740
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,840
I do what I do for my family,
for the company,

741
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,439
and for your future.

742
01:18:39,569 --> 01:18:43,479
Have you ever asked me
if I want that future?

743
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:45,880
I don't want it.

744
01:18:48,649 --> 01:18:51,079
That's why you do crazy things
to spite me.

745
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,079
Do you think you're so clever?

746
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:57,199
You must feel amazing.
You have your own company.

747
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:58,649
You're arrogant.

748
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:01,159
You think I'm childish.

749
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,159
You keep controlling my life
and arranging everything for me.

750
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
You think I'm stupid.

751
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:11,960
You know, we always fight
when we're around each other.

752
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,239
I feel unhappy when I'm with you.

753
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:26,609
You may be successful in life.

754
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:28,479
But to me,

755
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:30,649
you're a bad father.

756
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:32,079
Lan!

757
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:33,319
Dear!

758
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,960
Get out!

759
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:44,760
Get out of my house!

760
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:46,399
Go!

761
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,239
Lan.

762
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:17,359
Dear,

763
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:21,039
am I a bad father?

764
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,720
I'm a bad father, right?

765
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,609
What you did today

766
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,880
affects the company's credibility.

767
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,479
I know.

768
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,399
But I chose what's best for us.

769
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:56,880
Are you saying I caused this?

770
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:03,840
I'm the cause of this whole thing.

771
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,279
Without me,
everything would be easier.

772
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,359
That's shallow and childish of you.

773
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,760
I can deal with all the trouble.

774
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,000
If you want to prove yourself,
then keep your promise.

775
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:19,000
If you can't do that,
it will all just be a childish joke.

776
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,800
I don't joke around with my life,

777
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:25,680
but everyone is joking around
with mine.

778
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:38,079
Lak, wasn't that too harsh?

779
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:39,840
It was too soft.

780
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,920
Lan.

781
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,960
You said you don't care.
So try to be consistent.

782
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:42,319
Don't follow me.

783
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,569
I don't want your sympathy.

784
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:25,439
I think if he went this far,

785
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:27,529
you should let him do what he wants.

786
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:29,649
Danai and I will handle the press.

787
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,609
As for his position, you should
find a better replacement.

788
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,359
I agree with her.

789
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,199
Lan hasn't handed me
his resignation letter.

790
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:46,119
He will remain
in the position for now.

791
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,279
I will do everything I can

792
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,960
to get him back.

793
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:56,039
Why do you still insist on
giving him the position

794
01:23:56,359 --> 01:23:58,399
when you have Danai and me?

795
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,159
Just do as he says.

796
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,920
You may be successful in life.

797
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:54,800
But to me,

798
01:24:55,609 --> 01:24:56,960
you're a bad father.

799
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:58,439
Lan!

800
01:24:58,609 --> 01:24:59,920
Dear!

801
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,720
If you want to prove yourself,
then keep your promise.

802
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,199
If you can't do that,

803
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:10,119
it will all just be a childish joke.

804
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,840
Why did you follow me?

805
01:26:05,529 --> 01:26:08,399
I didn't. I was just passing by.

806
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,119
I want to be alone.

807
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,399
You did your best.

808
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,359
Good job, Chalantorn.

809
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,479
You're annoying.

810
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:01,439
You said you wouldn't
care about me anymore.

811
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:07,319
Thanks, anyway,

812
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:10,319
for being here.

813
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:11,479
Look.

814
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,640
What proof do you have
that my sister is behind everything?

815
01:29:15,479 --> 01:29:18,840
What proof do you have
that your sister didn't do it?

816
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,760
Nothing.

817
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,079
Then your sister and Rawin
are the suspects.

818
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,800
Lak, please stop.

819
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,279
I'm as calm as I can be.

820
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,479
If he wants everything,
he can have it.

821
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,600
- He can have it.
- Hey, Lak.

822
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,399
If you want everything back,

823
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I will help you.

824
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:37,960
Someone made a threat against you.

825
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,119
I can't believe
it's actually what I thought.
