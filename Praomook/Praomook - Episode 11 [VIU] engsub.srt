1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,719
I don't agree with your attempt
to sabotage their relationship.

4
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,639
I'm just pushing her
to get a divorce early.

5
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,090
I'm trying to help my brother here.

6
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,159
It's never a secret
when you say it's a secret.

7
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,039
The culprit will hear
about my request for the documents.

8
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
This rumor that Lan
is going to be vice president,

9
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
I want to hear
his reasons right now.

10
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,280
Why does Dad refuse to
recognize my capability?

11
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,800
It's unfair.

12
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Help me choose. Leave this house,
or I will leave myself.

13
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm getting back together with Nuch.

14
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,319
From now on,

15
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
I will pursue you.

16
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,759
I want to see you.
Can I come to your place?

17
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,680
Danai's car.

18
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Hey, Lan.

19
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
Hey, are you home?

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,879
No, I'm out. Do you need anything?

21
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,719
Nothing.

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,759
I want to know if you and Lak
saw the news about me.

23
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,199
We saw it.

24
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,240
Who do you think spread the news?

25
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,479
I don't know. I don't want to guess.

26
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,199
Do you want to know about
Lak's reaction or mine?

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
Both.

28
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,240
What did she say about it?

29
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,960
She didn't say anything.
It's just a rumor.

30
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,439
There's nothing to worry about.

31
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,079
Okay. I've got to go.

32
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,199
There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,000
She just flew into a rage.

34
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,199
Hey. I've been searching
for this book.

35
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Here.

36
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,730
The book is mine.
Do you have my permission?

37
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,199
I won't read it then.

38
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,170
Sorry for touching your stuff.

39
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,610
Rut.

40
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,000
If you want to read this book,
I can let you borrow it.

41
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,879
In return, you have to
stop being mad at me.

42
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,839
I'm not mad at you.

43
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,839
I'm just frustrated.
I don't like being paranoid.

44
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,639
What are you smiling about?

45
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
I like it.

46
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Rut.

47
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,079
I like it when
you're honest with me.

48
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,439
I want to know
how you feel about me.

49
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
You can feel anything
you want about me.

50
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,959
As long as you don't hate me.

51
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,959
I want to see you.

52
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,040
Can I go to your place?

53
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,399
He wants to see me.

54
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,720
Should I let him?

55
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,319
You can't beat me, Mook.

56
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,399
Will you go after him?

57
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,319
I can go with you.

58
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,040
No. He can go wherever he wants.

59
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,759
Can you be my witness?

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,279
I'm going to keep this file
as evidence and sue that woman.

61
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,319
Sure.

62
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,439
Win.

63
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,519
Why did you just arrive?

64
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,279
I just finished my work.

65
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,639
You've drunk a lot.
I think it should be enough.

66
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,519
No. I want to drink.

67
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,439
Don't stop me.

68
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Win.

69
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,799
My dad spread the news

70
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,840
about Lan becoming
vice president himself.

71
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
And?

72
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,360
In the end,
Dad doesn't care about me.

73
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,679
He doesn't appreciate my dedication.

74
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,919
I've worked like a dog

75
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,330
hoping that he would
at least recognize me.

76
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
Look where it got me.

77
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,960
It's pointless.

78
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,759
Lan is still number one.

79
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,879
To be honest with you, Win,

80
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,919
I want everything

81
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,330
and I will have it.

82
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,240
Win.

83
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,799
You have to stay by my side.

84
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,919
I won't leave you.

85
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,559
You're important to me.

86
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,440
Lak.

87
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,720
Danai.

88
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,559
(Chalantorn)

89
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,360
Lan, I want to meet you.

90
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,679
You wouldn't understand adult love.

91
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,879
This is an adult matter.
Mind your own business.

92
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,679
Jerk, I'm not a kid anymore.

93
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,759
You're under 18.
To me, you're a kid.

94
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,279
Alright. If you think turning 18
means you become an adult,

95
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,360
I will show you.

96
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
We'll see once it's my birthday.

97
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,679
Lak.

98
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,879
Lak.

99
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Lak.

100
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,159
- Hey, Lak.
- Don't bother me.

101
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,320
Did I scare you?

102
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,039
No, you didn't.

103
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,240
What happened anyway?

104
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,639
Why is my sister drunk?

105
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,639
She had a fight with your father.

106
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,679
What was it about?

107
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,279
She doesn't want you to be a
vice president with zero experience.

108
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,519
And your father doesn't care
what she thinks.

109
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
I think you should take her home.

110
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,039
Danai won't be pleased
if I take her home.

111
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll take it from here.

112
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,919
Thank you for being there for her.

113
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Sure.

114
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,399
(Where are you?
Why aren't you home?)

115
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,120
He can go wherever he wants.
You don't have to care about him.

116
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,399
He wants to make you feel restless.

117
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,039
You have to be calm
and keep a cool head.

118
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,759
Just ask him if you're curious.
Then you can feel at ease.

119
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,679
Get it over with and go to bed.

120
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,639
Don't ask him. Stay calm.

121
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,159
Just ask him and
get him out of your mind.

122
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
- Don't do it.
- Do it.

123
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,320
- Don't do it.
- Do it.

124
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,879
- Don't do it.
- Do it.

125
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
- Don't do it.
- I said, "do it!"

126
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,200
- Don't do it.
- Come on.

127
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,720
Why didn't you tell me
Lak had a fight with my father?

128
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,480
I didn't want to worry you.

129
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,159
She is at the condo.

130
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,960
If I take her home in this state,
it will only cause problems.

131
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,279
It's my fault.

132
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,440
If I were there for her,
she would be more cautious.

133
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,080
Stay with her. I'll be there soon.

134
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,519
Okay.

135
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,960
What a mess.

136
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,890
Lan.

137
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,200
Yes, it's me.

138
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,720
How did you get here?

139
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,799
Win called me to pick you up.
You passed out.

140
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,960
Don't bother next time.

141
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,359
I can take care of myself.

142
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,799
From what I saw, you were hammered.

143
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,680
If it wasn't for Win,
you wouldn't be in this state.

144
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,960
I know what I'm doing.

145
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,890
Can you leave me alone?

146
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,279
Danai is on his way here.

147
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,559
Why did you tell him?

148
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,319
I don't want to see his face.

149
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,079
You all are annoying.

150
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,559
If you're angry at Dad,
don't take it out on Danai.

151
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,079
Someday he will lose
his patience with you.

152
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,170
Can you stop complaining?

153
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,720
I'll leave once he arrives.

154
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,119
You fought with Dad about the news,
didn't you?

155
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,839
I won't accept the position.
So you don't have to worry.

156
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,480
Don't worry?

157
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,759
How can I not worry?

158
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,440
You don't know what you're doing,
but Dad thinks you do.

159
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,890
He tries to make you
take responsibility

160
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,759
even though you're incapable.

161
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,759
He will stop only when you give in.

162
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,079
I'm begging you.

163
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,519
Can you go back to living abroad?

164
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,039
Go back to do what you love
quickly before I...

165
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,559
hate you.

166
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,839
I don't want to see you.

167
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,839
Go back to do what you love
quickly before I...

168
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,440
hate you.

169
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,759
(Lan)

170
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,279
(Lan)

171
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,759
Oh.

172
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,279
Lan.

173
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,039
Oh.

174
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,640
(Lan)

175
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,960
He didn't pick up his phone.
What's wrong with him?

176
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,559
Who called you?

177
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,279
Lan called me just now.

178
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,799
I didn't answer. When I called back,
he didn't answer.

179
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,480
I guess he doesn't want
to talk to you now.

180
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,599
I guess so.

181
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,920
I feel sorry for myself.

182
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,039
I can't please everyone.

183
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,559
One wants that thing.

184
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,200
The other wants the other thing.

185
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,680
This one wants...

186
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,480
It's true, dear.

187
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,119
We only care about ourselves.

188
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,400
Now,

189
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,039
how can I let it go?

190
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,039
Oh, come on. Don't sulk.

191
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,559
Dear, trust me. I'm sure that
eventually our kids will realize

192
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,200
that you're doing it out of love.

193
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,039
Come on.

194
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,599
I hope I don't die
before it happens.

195
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,480
Don't say that.

196
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Whatever.
I'll try to call him again.

197
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,720
If he doesn't answer,
we can figure it out tomorrow.

198
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,480
Well, if you say so.

199
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,519
Lan.

200
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Lan.

201
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,359
Lan.

202
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,559
Lan, can you hear me?

203
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,720
Lan.

204
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,799
Lan.

205
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,200
Lan, wake up.

206
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Lan.

207
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,559
Lan.

208
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,799
We should call an ambulance.

209
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
This looks serious.
We don't know what happened to him.

210
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,880
- Okay.
- Don't.

211
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,200
- Lan.
- Lan.

212
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,279
How do you feel?
Tell me where it hurts.

213
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,440
What happened?
Why are you lying on the ground?

214
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,200
I was hit from behind.

215
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,519
You were hit?

216
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,160
- Where? Oh.
- Ah!

217
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,480
How did you get here?

218
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,680
He came with me.

219
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,200
(Location Tracking App)

220
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,680
(Open)

221
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,960
(Get Started)

222
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,640
Condo...

223
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,000
This isn't Treenuch's condo.

224
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,279
Where is he?

225
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,799
This is his family's condo.

226
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,079
I see.

227
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,240
That's his car. He really is here.

228
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,599
If you want to go to his room,
I can arrange that for you.

229
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,119
This way.

230
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,440
Rut, whose hand is that?

231
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,200
Wait here. I'll go check.

232
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
- Lan!
- Lan!

233
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,599
- Lan!
- Lan!

234
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,079
- Lan!
- Lan!

235
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,240
- Lan!
- Lan!

236
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,039
- Lan!
- Lan!

237
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,920
Lan, what's wrong?

238
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,880
Lan, can you hear me?

239
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,680
- Lan.
- Lan!

240
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,519
Answer me, Lan.

241
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
- Lan.
- Lan.

242
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:11,079
- Lan.
- Lan, can you hear me?

243
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,319
Lan.

244
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,400
What happened, Mook, Marut?

245
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
You cling to me like a sharksucker.

246
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,680
No wonder

247
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,920
you're always there when I get hurt.

248
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,599
It's suspicious.

249
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,920
Is this the time to be saying that?
I'm trying to help you.

250
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,480
I don't owe you anything.

251
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,880
We should tell the police.

252
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you remember what happened?

253
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,480
I was walking toward my car.

254
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,039
Suddenly

255
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,599
it felt like I was hit
with a hard object.

256
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,680
Does this belong to you?

257
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,279
Yes, it's mine.

258
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,680
I think it was a robbery.

259
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,720
You had one job.
How could you let this happen?

260
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,640
I'm going to inform your manager
about your negligence.

261
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,759
I'm sorry.

262
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,079
No, it's fine.

263
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,279
Let me help.

264
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,039
Careful.

265
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,599
I'm okay.

266
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,160
Call the police.

267
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,799
Check the cameras
and do a thorough investigation.

268
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,920
- Let me know if you see something.
- Absolutely.

269
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,279
- Here is my card.
- Okay.

270
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,599
Get your superior.

271
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Yes, sir.

272
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,359
You should see a doctor.

273
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,119
I agree with him.
You have to see a doctor.

274
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,119
Alright.

275
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,559
I'll handle the police.

276
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,200
You can go to the hospital.

277
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,319
Danai,

278
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,640
could you keep this a secret?

279
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,839
I don't want
my family to know about this.

280
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,400
Why, though?

281
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't want to worry them.

282
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,119
The factory incident is unsolved.
Now there's this.

283
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,039
You know that
it will become serious if Dad knows.

284
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,319
If you say so.

285
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,480
Mook and I will take care of him.

286
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Let's go.

287
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,759
- Take care of him.
- Sure.

288
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Careful.

289
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,119
What did the doctor say?

290
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,079
His brain is undamaged.

291
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,319
Just inflamed, swollen muscles.

292
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,799
A fever is expected tonight.

293
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,440
I think you should rest
for a couple of days.

294
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,200
Lie low for now.

295
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,640
Good idea.
I don't feel like working anyway.

296
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,759
Poom,

297
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,640
check up on the condo's cameras.

298
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,759
Got it.

299
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,720
I don't think it's a robbery.

300
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,319
I agree.

301
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,839
If it was a robbery,

302
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,200
he should have taken
your phone or watch

303
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,319
or found a way to ransack your car.

304
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,279
Only your money was stolen.

305
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,039
I think it's a cover-up.

306
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,039
Right.

307
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm heading to bed.
I'll think about other things later.

308
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,279
I want to be alone.

309
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,480
After Chalantorn fell,
we don't see the robber anywhere.

310
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,159
Get images from that camera.

311
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Rawin.

312
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Hey.

313
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,159
What's that position?

314
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,920
Why are you here?
I told you to leave me alone.

315
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:12,880
I want to check up on you.

316
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,719
If you don't seem alright,
I will call an ambulance.

317
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,679
Come here. Let me apply a cold
compress to keep swelling down.

318
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,199
I can do it myself. Leave me alone.

319
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,920
Ouch, hey!

320
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,840
I told you to stay still.
I'll do it for you.

321
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,519
I want you to think carefully
who could be your enemy.

322
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,769
I think it's the same attacker.

323
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,480
Well, you're my enemy.

324
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,599
If you want to believe that, fine.

325
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,920
But it's a good idea
to consider someone else too.

326
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,360
Even small leads are important.

327
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,639
They could prevent you
from getting hurt.

328
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,960
I don't want to see you die.

329
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,119
I'll give it a try.

330
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,599
Oh, he is burning up.
Will he be okay?

331
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,719
Lan.

332
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,639
Lan, how are you feeling?

333
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Nuch.

334
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,809
Wait, don't go.

335
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,519
Please stay with me.

336
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,880
Jerk, I don't care anymore.
I'm leaving.

337
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:31,329
You could have mentioned
someone else but her.

338
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,599
I should have gone to bed
and left you to die.

339
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,559
Have you ever seen me?

340
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,960
He hasn't seen you.

341
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,000
But I have.

342
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,599
Rut.

343
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,239
You seem annoyed this morning.

344
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,679
Let me guess.

345
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,329
Lan is the cause, isn't he?

346
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,960
I think we should be honest
with each other.

347
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,559
About what?

348
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,960
I made it clear
that I'm going to pursue you.

349
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,559
I'm a man of my word.

350
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,119
I don't trust you.

351
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,239
Why?

352
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,519
You're suddenly pursuing me.

353
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,519
Lan is getting back with Treenuch.

354
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,679
The timing is too coincidental.

355
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,920
You could be trying to trick me
into divorcing your friend.

356
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,920
Well.

357
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,360
That's possible.

358
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,159
But I only have one plan.

359
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,809
And that is to make you love me
and forget about him.

360
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,639
I think he made it clear
that he hates you.

361
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,880
I want you to stop
thinking about him.

362
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,809
Forget about your past with him.

363
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
And give me a chance.

364
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,199
I'm not ready to
give anybody a chance.

365
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,400
Like my sister told you,

366
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,599
although he doesn't love me,
we're technically married.

367
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,329
I want to wait until it's over
before I start my life over.

368
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,809
That's fine with me. I can wait.

369
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:38,809
However, I have the right to
try and make you interested.

370
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,639
I will make you take off this ring

371
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,559
without regretting it.

372
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,400
Even if I don't have you,

373
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,840
I can take this ring off
without regretting it.

374
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Within a year,
if you take off the ring,

375
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,039
I will take it as
you giving me a chance.

376
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:32,559
Hold on.

377
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,769
That condition clearly benefits you.

378
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,119
Who would make a condition
that doesn't benefit them?

379
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,679
So, are we clear?

380
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,159
Wait, Rut.
I haven't agreed to your condition.

381
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,360
Who cares?

382
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:07,519
What are you doing?

383
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,400
I'm taking your temperature.

384
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,119
If you have a high fever,
I'm going to call an ambulance.

385
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,760
I'm fine. Leave me alone.

386
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
Hey!

387
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,039
Stay still.

388
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,559
Your temperature came down.
You should rest a while longer.

389
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,320
I'm doing this for your parents.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered.

390
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,199
Then don't bother next time.

391
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,800
You can leave me to die.

392
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,519
Hey! What was that for?

393
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,800
Don't talk about death.
It's a bad omen.

394
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,960
If you talk about it again,
I will give you another smack.

395
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,119
Hey!

396
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Lan.

397
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,119
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

398
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,800
Why did you kick it?

399
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,840
It's in my way.

400
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,159
You look much better.

401
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,320
Do it yourself then.

402
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,920
The new collection
will arrive next week.

403
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:27,800
I want you to clear the area
and arrange things accordingly.

404
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,920
If there are any changes,
I will tell you later.

405
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
Sure.

406
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:35,639
Win.

407
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,960
You can go back to work.

408
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,719
I'm sorry about last night.
I was so drunk.

409
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,079
Don't get that drunk again.
It's dangerous.

410
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,480
If I wasn't stressed,
I wouldn't do it.

411
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:00,840
Drinking won't solve your problem.

412
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,519
I think you should deal with
the cause of this problem instead.

413
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,440
You mean...

414
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,639
You know who
the cause of your problem is.

415
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,760
You have to handle that instead.

416
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,440
There are many ways to do it.
It's up to you to decide.

417
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:23,559
I'll need to think about
which way is the best.

418
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,559
(Dad)

419
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:40,840
You spread the rumor about me
becoming vice president, didn't you?

420
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,599
Yes, I did.

421
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,119
Dad,

422
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,639
you do things however you want.
Have you asked me how I feel?

423
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,440
Why do I have to ask you?

424
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:53,119
This is your responsibility.

425
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,840
Whether you want it or not
doesn't matter.

426
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,599
I didn't ask for
this responsibility.

427
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,280
You can hand the company
over to Lak. I don't want it.

428
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,679
And if you don't listen to me,

429
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,519
I will ruin everything.

430
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,840
Lan, I haven't finished talking.

431
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,199
You...

432
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,960
Come on, you stupid son.

433
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,880
- Lan!
- Lan!

434
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,599
Lan, are you okay?

435
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:49,599
Lan!

436
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,960
I want to talk about Lan.

437
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,760
He is sick.

438
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:12,960
What's wrong with him?

439
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,960
He has a fever.
He talked about you in his sleep.

440
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,679
Why are you telling me this?

441
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Don't you feel jealous
that he talked about me?

442
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,480
I think you know the answer.

443
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,519
I want to hear it from you,

444
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,440
whether I was right or wrong.

445
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,639
Lan and I are just friends.

446
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,119
Where is he?
I'm going to visit him right away.

447
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,440
I was wondering why
you asked me to find her number.

448
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,760
So this is your evil plan.

449
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,239
Do you want me to be evil with you?

450
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:11,880
No, I don't want to bother you.

451
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,960
Nuch seems untrustworthy.

452
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,039
Do you think it's a good idea
to let her get this close to Lan?

453
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:24,079
That's exactly why
we have to keep her close.

454
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,400
We must lure enemies
out of the shadows.

455
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,840
That way,
we can keep an eye on them.

456
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:35,519
I knew you did this to help Lan.

457
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,760
You wouldn't be selfish
and use people for your own gain.

458
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:44,960
Getting fired or a pay cut.

459
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,559
Which one do you choose?

460
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,760
I think I should take a look
at the images we got from the condo.

461
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:29,280
Leave him be.

462
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,559
I'm helping him.

463
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,920
If there's something wrong with him,
we can get an ambulance.

464
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,480
Is he okay?

465
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,000
He is alive. He just fainted.

466
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:48,679
Lan.

467
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:55,519
Nuch.

468
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,840
How did you get here?

469
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,360
Rut called me saying that
you're sick and miss me very much.

470
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,519
I've really missed you.

471
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,159
Anyway, are you okay?
Do you have a headache?

472
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,400
I can take you to the hospital
if you want.

473
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,239
I'm okay.

474
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,400
I feel better
after seeing your face.

475
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,639
I'm still worried though.

476
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,559
I'm going to stay with you today.

477
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:17,159
What are you doing?

478
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:20,159
Oh, don't mind me.

479
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,159
If you want to flirt with your ex,

480
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,079
or your mistress,
feel free to do so.

481
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,840
I just want to record it as evidence
for the divorce

482
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,559
and sue you for having an affair
with my husband.

483
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,280
Do you think you can stop me
with that threat?

484
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:43,119
I'm not stopping you,
you can do as you please.

485
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,679
Now, having an affair with
a married man,

486
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,639
don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

487
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,280
Or is your moral sense so low
that you feel nothing?

488
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,000
I see that
you still have no manners.

489
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,679
I'm just trying to protect my right.

490
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
If you can't handle that,
you're free to leave.

491
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:12,039
You have no right to kick me out.

492
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,039
And don't give me
the excuse that he is gay.

493
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,199
Rut told me the truth.

494
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,960
Lan faked being gay
to avoid marrying you.

495
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:32,119
Pathetic. You forced
a man to marry you.

496
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,960
If I were you,
I wouldn't have done it.

497
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:43,079
If I were you, I would wait
for him to get a divorce

498
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:44,559
before following him to his house.

499
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,920
I don't know who is more pathetic
between you and me.

500
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,159
I came here as his friend,

501
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,119
but you keep calling me
his mistress. I should leave.

502
00:57:57,639 --> 00:57:59,440
Lan, it looks like I have to leave.

503
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:01,679
Take care. I'm worried about you.

504
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:07,039
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.

505
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,239
- But...
- I said you can stay.

506
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,280
If someone is upset about that,

507
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,039
they can leave.

508
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,280
I have to talk to her.

509
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,320
Then talk to her.
I'm not stopping you.

510
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,599
Alone.

511
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,320
Since you chose not to leave,

512
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:35,119
listen to this.

513
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,719
Nuch,

514
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:43,320
you asked me
if we could get back together,

515
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,960
now I have the answer.

516
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,880
After I divorce Praomook,

517
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,480
we will get back together.

518
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:57,719
Is that true? I'm so happy.

519
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:01,679
I want you to wait for me.

520
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:04,760
Of course, I will wait.

521
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,639
And don't worry.
I don't feel anything for my wife.

522
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,840
Let the countdown begin.

523
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,639
At least you're going to wait
for the divorce.

524
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,840
Before that day comes,
try to control yourself.

525
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,880
If I catch you sleeping with her,

526
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:31,800
I'm going to be a murderous wife
and cut your member off.

527
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:35,480
An immoral man should be rid of
the ability to reproduce.

528
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:38,840
Do you think
you can do anything to me?

529
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
You smart mouth.

530
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,199
Why don't we find out about that?

531
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,119
Now, you,

532
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,599
if you want to eat my leftovers,
I don't care.

533
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,920
But I will make sure
that you don't find happiness.

534
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,960
If you want to suffer in this hell,
go ahead.

535
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,079
Wait, I don't think
that's necessary.

536
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:01,000
With the idea of taking him from me,
you already entered this hell.

537
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,960
- You!
- Nuch.

538
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,360
Don't pay attention to other people.

539
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,320
Let's focus on us.

540
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,000
Alright. We are more important.

541
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,840
You asked me
if we could get back together,

542
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,039
now I have the answer.

543
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:27,440
After I divorce Praomook,

544
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,400
we will get back together.

545
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,239
I recorded everything.
Try to keep your promise.

546
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,079
Because if you don't,
you will break your own word.

547
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,800
I don't have to be scared of you.
I can do whatever I want.

548
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,800
You're self-centered.

549
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,639
Don't think you can hurt me
by pretending to love her.

550
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:51,800
I don't feel anything.

551
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,519
Hang in there, Mook.

552
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,920
It doesn't hurt you.
It doesn't disappoint you.

553
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,800
You don't feel anything.

554
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,079
That jerk doesn't feel anything.
Why should you?

555
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,239
You don't love him.

556
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,440
(Uncle Lim)

557
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:55,599
Hello, Uncle.

558
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,719
Mook, are you with my son?

559
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:02,719
Yes, I am.

560
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,840
Can you take him to the company now?

561
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,119
We have to discuss his future
and the future of the company.

562
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,159
Before you talk to him,
I want to talk to you first.

563
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:29,559
Lan.

564
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,920
You asked me to wait for you.
Did you mean it?

565
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,119
About us getting back together,

566
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,760
did you actually mean it?
Or was it meant to hurt her?

567
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
I meant it.

568
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:56,559
I want to figure out
my feelings for you.

569
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:00,039
Is it because you're my ex?

570
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,119
Is it an awkward feeling
between old friends?

571
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,800
Or is it because I still love you?

572
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,239
I'm happy to hear that.

573
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,519
At least I still have a chance
to get back into your life.

574
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,880
Give me some time.

575
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,360
I'll let you know
as soon as I get the answer.

576
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,960
You can let me know
when you're ready.

577
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:30,159
All I want is the truth.

578
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,840
Whatever your answer is,
I can take it.

579
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,159
But please know this.

580
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,559
I still love you.

581
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:06,239
Rut, how can I help you?

582
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,639
I have work for you.

583
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,360
Work?

584
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,039
That's my game!

585
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:28,679
Your game is very interesting.

586
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,320
I've studied the market.

587
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,039
The young female demographic
has interesting purchasing power.

588
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:38,880
I think if you develop this game
and release it,

589
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,360
we're going to get a new market
for the company.

590
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,480
But if you don't want to work on it,

591
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:49,199
I can throw this in the bin.

592
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:51,119
No, I will work on it.

593
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:54,360
I want to work on it.

594
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,440
However, if you don't
finish it by the deadline,

595
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:10,480
I will throw it in the bin.

596
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,480
I will make sure
to finish it by the deadline.

597
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,960
I will do my best.

598
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,480
We'll see.

599
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,119
I made your favorite shrimp
rice porridge with extra garlic.

600
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:42,440
Let me feed you.

601
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:22,079
I'll get the door.

602
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:47,280
Hey, guys. Mook asked me to keep
an eye on you until she comes back.

603
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,159
She worries that you may develop
a fever, so she asked me to be here.

604
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:56,960
I will take care of my friend's
husband as though he is my own.

605
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:01,719
I will protect you at all costs.

606
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,800
Not even a fly can touch you.

607
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,760
Were you having a meal?

608
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:35,239
Yes, we were.

609
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,000
I'll take it from here.

610
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:38,239
Lan, have a seat.

611
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,840
No, I can feed myself.

612
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:50,079
Ouch!

613
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:52,609
Please.

614
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,760
Why didn't anyone tell me that
my son was attacked?

615
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:03,680
He asked us not to tell you.

616
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,760
But I think you should know.

617
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,319
This wasn't the first time
he was attacked.

618
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,529
He was being shot at
when I met him in Korea.

619
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,720
I bumped into him and saved him.

620
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,800
I didn't know you were at the scene.

621
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,479
Rut and Lan told me
he got the wrong guy.

622
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,920
It was the right guy.

623
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,680
After that incident, Lan got into
many troubling situations,

624
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,680
and I was always there.

625
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,680
Mook, thank you for saving him.

626
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:34,529
I'm not sure
I can save him every time.

627
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:37,800
I'm certain that
someone is trying to hurt him.

628
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,319
I think we have to find
the person behind this whole thing.

629
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,239
Do you have a conflict with anybody?

630
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,279
It could be my competitor.

631
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,880
But it isn't a feud.

632
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,800
Do you think I'm the cause of this?

633
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,319
I don't know.

634
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm trying to figure out who would
benefit the most from this.

635
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:15,039
But I can't think of anyone.

636
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,479
I'll look into it.

637
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,920
For now,

638
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,479
you and Lan have to be very careful.

639
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,529
Let me know immediately
if something happens.

640
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:33,319
I will.

641
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,119
By the way,
could you keep this a secret?

642
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:40,840
I don't want to fight with him.

643
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,239
Sure.

644
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,960
I need your help
with one more thing.

645
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:50,359
What is it?

646
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:56,960
Make him accept the position
as vice president.

647
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:27,119
Danai.

648
01:11:29,529 --> 01:11:31,039
I've been looking for you.

649
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:34,159
What do you want with me?

650
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:54,159
Win?

651
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:57,800
This is why I need to
talk to you in private.

652
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:00,880
I don't want the others
to hear about this.

653
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,199
I don't know why Rawin was there.

654
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,399
On the bright side,
he might have a friend there.

655
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,399
On the dark side,

656
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:14,760
he could be the attacker.

657
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:20,039
What would be his reason
for harming Lan?

658
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,680
What would he gain from this?

659
01:12:33,609 --> 01:12:35,319
I'm looking into it.

660
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:39,569
I don't know what his motive is.

661
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,609
Also, I have a suspicion

662
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,800
that the incident at the factory

663
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:51,199
could be his doing.

664
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:07,159
I won't believe he is the culprit
until I have proof.

665
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,119
Me too.

666
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,960
I just want you and Lan
to be careful

667
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:15,239
and help me.

668
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:16,569
Help you with what?

669
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,960
Help me keep an eye on Rawin
to see if he is guilty.

670
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,039
You work with him.

671
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:24,239
You should be able to
get close to him.

672
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,439
And let me know
if you find anything.

673
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,880
We have to work together
for Lan's safety.

674
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:34,159
Are you okay with that?

675
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,800
Okay.

676
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:28,680
Oh, Mook.

677
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,359
I thought you took a day off.

678
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,119
I came to discuss something
with the president

679
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:38,760
and visit you.

680
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,720
Visit me? Is there something wrong?

681
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,680
I came here in case you had
an update on the project.

682
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,479
Oh, I was about to
send you an email.

683
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:51,319
The client wants to
change the design.

684
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:57,039
Then shall we discuss it right away?

685
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,199
Absolutely.

686
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:23,800
I think we should try this.

687
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,529
If we want to add roundness
to the middle,

688
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,119
we may have to increase
the angle of the main wall.

689
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:35,609
Um...

690
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:38,319
What's wrong?

691
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,439
I just noticed that
you're ambidextrous.

692
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:44,800
I thought you were left-handed.

693
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,529
Oh, I can use both hands
equally well.

694
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,399
I broke my left arm,
and it was in a cast for months.

695
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,649
I had to train my right hand.

696
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:56,880
After it healed,
I could use both hands.

697
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,760
Is that strange to you?

698
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:02,960
It just surprised me.

699
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,079
There's a lot about me
that will surprise you.

700
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,960
How are you?

701
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:36,439
Let me check your temperature.

702
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:51,119
Here.

703
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,840
Ouch!

704
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:56,239
Hey!

705
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,000
That's enough.

706
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,039
This is not enough for people who
try to take someone else's husband.

707
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:06,399
Enough.

708
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:08,119
Nuch.

709
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,319
I think you should leave.

710
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,800
If you stay,
my fever will come back.

711
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:19,199
Hey!

712
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:44,680
Are you calling me to say thank you?

713
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:46,649
I'm calling you to yell at you.

714
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,079
You asked Nuch to come here
and meet Duckling on purpose.

715
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:51,880
It's for your own sake.

716
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:55,239
I saw that you were sick,
so I asked Nuch to take care of you.

717
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,239
You should thank me instead

718
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:00,609
for giving you the opportunity
to get close to her.

719
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,840
So you can finally realize
that you still love her.

720
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,880
I owe you nothing.
You also benefit from this.

721
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,039
You allowed a stranger like her
into your house,

722
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:13,569
sacrificing your privacy.

723
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:15,880
This must be worth it.

724
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,079
Let's say we both benefit from this.

725
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:20,199
You and Nuch get to work things out.

726
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:23,319
And I get to pursue Mook
the way I want to.

727
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:24,479
That's a win-win situation for us.

728
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,239
I'll call you back.

729
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,920
What?

730
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,000
We heard everything.

731
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,199
Why didn't you knock
before you came in?

732
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,399
You told Treenuch to go to
your house, didn't you?

733
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,239
I asked you a question.

734
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,920
We knocked, but you didn't hear us.

735
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:10,359
I also asked you a question.
Answer me.

736
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,399
That's right. It's my house.
Anyone with my permission can enter.

737
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,960
You use people to create
opportunities for yourself.

738
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:21,840
That's right.

739
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,760
I believe it now that
you always get what you want.

740
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:28,529
You don't care how you get it
or if it's right or wrong.

741
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:33,760
What about this opportunity
you gave me to develop the game?

742
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,079
Do you actually care about it,

743
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:39,000
or are you just using it
to get on my good side?

744
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,159
You want me on your team,
so I'll help you with my sister.

745
01:20:42,529 --> 01:20:43,760
Believe whatever you will.

746
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,609
If I was given the opportunity
because of Mook, I don't want it.

747
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,039
Hold on, Petch.

748
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:52,279
I won't let you become the bad guy.

749
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,680
I will do everything to make sure
you don't get together with her.

750
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:59,199
I don't want to have a sly man
like you as my brother-in-law.

751
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Petch.

752
01:21:07,649 --> 01:21:10,359
Come on, Boss.
She misunderstood everything.

753
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,159
Why didn't you tell her
that her game is incredible?

754
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,319
Leave her be.

755
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,159
If she thinks her work is worthless,

756
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:22,239
I will think it's worthless too.

757
01:21:55,399 --> 01:21:57,159
I'm sorry for doing this.

758
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,279
I don't want you to be created
by someone's selfishness.

759
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,880
Lan.

760
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:45,279
Rawin was at the condo
while you were attacked.

761
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,840
From what I know,
he is Lak's friend from college.

762
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:54,840
He has a degree in interior design,
so she asked him to work for us.

763
01:22:55,529 --> 01:22:58,239
He could have followed me
because he was worried about her.

764
01:22:58,649 --> 01:22:59,760
I see.

765
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:01,800
Unrequited love.

766
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,800
I guess so.

767
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,720
I don't know what he would gain
from hurting me.

768
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:09,880
He might've been in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

769
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:11,279
Alright.

770
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,239
You evil, sly jerk.

771
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,039
You immoral, useless man.

772
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,840
Let's say we both benefit from this.

773
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,840
You and Nuch get to work things out.

774
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,760
And I get to pursue Mook
the way I want to.

775
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:36,079
That's a win-win situation for us.

776
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:43,529
I will make sure you don't succeed.
You will learn about failure.

777
01:23:44,529 --> 01:23:46,399
You can't beat righteousness.

778
01:24:53,649 --> 01:24:56,680
(The Next Vice President
Of A Major Furniture Manufacturer)

779
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:02,319
(Sorry, girls. Chalantorn is taken.
His bride is DJ Prao.)

780
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,760
Duckling.

781
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:32,529
- Hey.
- You did it, didn't you?

782
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:35,680
What are you doing? Let go.

783
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,359
Answer me. Did you do this?

784
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,119
(Sorry, girls. Chalantorn is taken.)

785
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:44,279
That's our wedding photo.

786
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:47,239
You leaked the news, didn't you?
Answer me.

787
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,159
I didn't do it.

788
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:50,840
Let go. You're hurting me.

789
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:52,840
- Ow!
- You did it.

790
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:56,800
You want people to know that
you're my wife, that I'm taken,

791
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,079
to stop me from seeing Nuch.

792
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:00,039
You're worse than I thought.

793
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:03,880
I didn't do it. What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

794
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:07,039
I know nothing. I have no idea
how they got the photo.

795
01:26:07,569 --> 01:26:10,359
Instead of yelling at me,
why don't you look for the truth?

796
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,880
I'm doing that right now,

797
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:13,319
getting the truth out of you.

798
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,039
Tell me that you did it.

799
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,609
You want me.

800
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,680
You want my father's money so much
you don't care how you get it.

801
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:23,529
You're capable of this.

802
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:25,359
I didn't do it.

803
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,199
Let go. You're hurting me.

804
01:26:27,569 --> 01:26:30,119
- Lan!
- I won't let go until you admit it.

805
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,279
- Lan.
- Let go.

806
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:33,649
Let go of her.

807
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,359
You can talk about this.

808
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:38,720
No way.
She ruined my relationship before.

809
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,159
Why can't she do it again?

810
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,720
I've had enough.

811
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:44,569
I won't take it anymore.

812
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:47,159
- Answer me.
- I didn't do it.

813
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:48,439
- Lan.
- Ow, Lan.

814
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,239
If you don't stop
this senseless behavior,

815
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,319
I won't let you talk to her.

816
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,649
Do you let a woman
come before your friend?

817
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,760
I do.

818
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,079
If my friend is crazy,
I have to take her side.

819
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:04,119
Get lost.

820
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,720
Rut!

821
01:27:10,279 --> 01:27:11,649
You're too hotheaded.

822
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:14,119
Calm yourself down,
then we will talk.

823
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,279
Mook,

824
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,960
please come with me.

825
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:20,159
I figured out who leaked
the news about their wedding.

826
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:21,439
Who is it?

827
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,319
I will end this madness.

828
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,319
From now on, I will be the hunter.

829
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,560
Think who could be at a disadvantage

830
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,680
and have a lot to lose
from your return.

831
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:37,159
My sister.

832
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:38,279
Lan!

833
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,800
Dear!

834
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,479
I want to know
what he planned to do about work.

835
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:44,560
I need you to find out.

836
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,800
I will free you from Praomook.

837
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,960
On one condition.

838
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,920
How much can you trust Treenuch?

839
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,359
Those who seem friendly
could be worse than you think.
