1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,359
(Praomook)

2
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,759
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,439
What proof do you have
that my sister is behind everything?

4
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,719
What proof do you have
that your sister didn't do it?

5
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Nothing.

6
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,370
Then your sister and Rawin
are the suspects.

7
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,599
Someone sent you a threat.

8
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
I can't believe
it's actually what I thought.

9
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,840
What did you say?

10
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,840
I'm sorry for
thinking only about myself.

11
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,680
If it isn't too late,

12
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,080
I'd like to come back
to help you out.

13
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,400
If you want everything back,

14
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,960
I will help you.

15
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
Life is unpredictable.

16
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,639
You don't know
what tomorrow will bring,

17
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,479
if you will be alive or dead.

18
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,599
What if he targets her instead,
who will be there to help her?

19
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,759
The number you dialed
cannot be reached.

20
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,319
(Nampetch)

21
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,840
(Rut)

22
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,159
Rut, did you miss me?

23
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,719
How is your sister?
I can't get a hold of her.

24
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Keep trying.
She will pick up eventually.

25
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,279
Or maybe she doesn't want to
answer your call.

26
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,610
Nampetch, this is important.

27
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,959
Can I talk to her?

28
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,170
Let me think about it.

29
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,439
Mook!

30
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
Anybody, help!

31
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,360
Anybody, help!

32
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,959
Petch, run away.

33
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,240
- No.
- Don't worry about me.

34
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,079
Come on.

35
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,480
Lan, don't follow him.

36
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,319
I have to catch him.

37
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,600
Call an ambulance.

38
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,839
Ambulance.

39
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Rut.

40
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,600
Rut, my sister was attacked.
I'm calling an ambulance.

41
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,639
- Rut.
- Where is the attacker?

42
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,319
He got away.

43
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,439
I called the police.
They should arrive shortly.

44
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,680
Mook, are you okay?

45
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,439
Petch, are you okay?

46
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,759
I'm okay.

47
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,160
But Mook got hurt badly.

48
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,160
If I was a second late, it might...

49
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,600
Petch, it will be okay.

50
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, they're here.

51
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
How was your dinner with the client?

52
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,159
We still have him,
but it may be different next year.

53
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,720
And?

54
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,039
I need to take a shower.
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

55
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,399
(Marriage Certificate)

56
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,399
(Marriage Certificate)

57
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,840
(Marriage Contract)

58
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
(property ownership shall belong
to the payer for 1 year...)

59
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,960
(Praomook)

60
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,879
(Praomook)

61
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Lan.

62
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,759
Something came up.

63
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,759
Does it have to do with Mook?

64
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,919
It does.

65
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,879
Once I handle it, we'll talk later.

66
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,679
Hey, what are you doing?

67
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,360
Anybody, help!

68
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,799
Help!

69
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,399
Lan, watch out!

70
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,799
Mom.

71
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,440
I'm going to take Mook with me.

72
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,159
Why?

73
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm worried about her mental state.

74
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,200
Staying here will remind her
of what happened.

75
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,919
Oh, poor girl.

76
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,759
Please take care of my daughter.

77
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,159
Let me know if anything happens.

78
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,320
I will do my best to keep her safe.

79
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
Take care.

80
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,879
If anything happens, no matter
how serious it may be, tell me.

81
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,759
We will get through it together.

82
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,960
Don't shoulder the burden
on your own.

83
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
I know, Mom.

84
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,440
Lan, I remember something.

85
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,079
What is it?

86
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,039
I bit his left arm.

87
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,720
It should've left a mark.

88
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,759
And

89
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,200
when he was choking me,

90
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,650
I...

91
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,650
I...

92
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,319
I...

93
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,890
Hey, that's enough.

94
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,559
You don't have to
think about it anymore.

95
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,799
You're starting to crack.
Don't strain yourself.

96
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,410
If you have something to say,
let's talk tomorrow.

97
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,799
What happened?

98
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,440
Lan, I'm scared.

99
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,759
It will be okay. You're safe now.

100
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,759
It's all in the past.

101
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,359
I'm fine.

102
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,480
I'm sorry.

103
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,119
It wasn't your fault.

104
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,650
But...

105
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,519
It was the attacker's fault.

106
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,480
Don't put the blame on yourself.

107
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,759
I'm alive because of you.

108
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,079
You did your best.

109
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,319
Thank you.

110
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,200
I hope you won't betray me.

111
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,359
I should stop myself right here.

112
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,039
Are you worried about
how other people may feel?

113
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,759
I am.

114
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,799
Even though I am right here,

115
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,200
you're thinking about other people.

116
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm pathetic.

117
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,519
- I...
- Don't talk anymore.

118
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,119
Leave me.

119
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
I can be by myself.

120
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,519
I said leave.

121
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,240
In the end, I lost.

122
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,960
I will never love Praomook.

123
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,079
Good. I don't want to stab someone
in the back.

124
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,039
And I don't like being
stabbed in the back either.

125
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,720
How is Mook?

126
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,960
She fell asleep.

127
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,559
That's good.

128
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,559
It's time to go to bed.

129
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,960
We have a lot
to deal with after this.

130
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Rut.

131
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,279
What?

132
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,079
Do you still like Mook?

133
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
I do.

134
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,960
Why do you ask?

135
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,559
I want to know
if you've changed your mind.

136
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,200
When it comes to Mook,
I don't waver easily.

137
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,759
Good.

138
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,039
What about you?

139
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,720
Do you feel the same about her?

140
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,759
I feel the same.

141
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,200
I should stop myself right here.

142
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,039
Are you worried about
how other people may feel?

143
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
I am.

144
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,359
Even though I am right here,

145
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
you think about other people.

146
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,599
I'm pathetic.

147
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,319
Where are you going?

148
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,359
I'm going to work.

149
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
Why?

150
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,079
You just went through something
traumatic. You should rest.

151
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,039
I have to deal with something.

152
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,440
I can't stop you, can I?

153
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,519
Stay safe, my stubborn sister.

154
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,559
Ow.

155
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I will.

156
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Have a seat.

157
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,839
Thank you.

158
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,319
Are you heading to work?

159
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,359
I am. I have to check on something.

160
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,680
I remember that I bit the attacker.
He should be injured.

161
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I also hit him in the back.

162
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,240
Unless he is super tough,
it should still hurt.

163
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,159
Lan is out.

164
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,329
I'm free today.
Let me give you a ride.

165
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,360
Let him take you to work.

166
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,119
If anything happens,
he and Oak will be able to help you.

167
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,119
My sister's safety is top priority.

168
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,079
What's wrong?

169
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,519
Do you have to be this alert?

170
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:09,809
You too, Rut.

171
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,039
We have to act tough
to scare off the attacker.

172
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:18,079
You look very scary.

173
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,360
I'm glad to see you in a good mood.

174
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,000
Good morning, Mook.

175
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,599
Good morning, Win.

176
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:47,440
Good morning, Rut.

177
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,329
Do you have business here,
or you're just dropping her off?

178
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,039
The latter.

179
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,559
Mook, you can go to work.

180
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,769
Rut and I will wait for you
at a nearby cafe.

181
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,559
Call me when you're finished.

182
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,599
I have to discuss
something with you.

183
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,559
Let's talk as we walk.

184
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Sure.

185
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,480
See you later, Rut.

186
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,719
Alright.

187
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,440
- Let's go.
- Okay.

188
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,329
Hello.

189
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,239
Have a seat.

190
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,519
I want you to look at this.

191
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,519
(Marriage Contract)

192
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,039
The contract is real, isn't it?

193
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:29,679
Tell me the truth.

194
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,840
The contract is real.

195
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,769
So you did it
for your own interests.

196
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:47,119
You don't care about my brother.

197
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,239
I admit that the house is part of
the reason why I married Lan.

198
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,809
You traded yourself for the house.
What are you going to do next?

199
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,599
Will you trade yourself for money
by having his baby

200
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,400
and use that
to live off my father's possessions?

201
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,559
No.

202
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,960
Once the term is over,
I will get a divorce.

203
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,719
What about Lan?

204
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:17,329
Don't you feel hesitate
about leaving him?

205
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,360
He won't feel anything.

206
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,639
I will probably become
one of his bad memories.

207
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,880
You don't love him?

208
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,159
I don't.

209
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,719
I feel bad for him that he married
a woman who doesn't love him

210
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
and only cares about
her own interests.

211
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:02,840
So this contract is real.

212
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,809
Now that you know the truth,
what will you do next, Lan?

213
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,679
Why did you ask for me?

214
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,360
I have something to show you.

215
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,000
(Marriage Contract)

216
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,809
(mortgage and debt shall be
paid off, on the condition that...)

217
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,960
She married for the house.
She doesn't care about you.

218
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,920
You're her leverage.

219
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:04,289
(property ownership shall belong
to the payer for 1 year...)

220
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,769
Don't jump to conclusions.
You don't even know if it's real.

221
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,329
If you want the truth,

222
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,400
why don't we ask her?

223
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,559
Now that it's come to this,

224
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,039
if you want to prove that
you aren't using Lan,

225
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,119
divorce him.

226
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,599
You're here to work,

227
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,880
or to see the damage you've done?

228
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,599
Both.

229
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:35,400
I have an appointment with Lak.
It's probably about the contract.

230
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,239
It would be great
if they get a divorce.

231
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,920
Lak will definitely
have a talk with her.

232
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,809
But I don't think her dad
would let them end the marriage.

233
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,199
As long as Lan hates her after this,

234
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,400
I will make them
get a divorce myself.

235
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,559
For now, we wait.

236
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,639
You did a great job.

237
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,199
Rut, do you think
they seem suspiciously close?

238
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,599
My instincts are telling me
they are more than co-workers.

239
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,760
- I...
- I will handle this myself.

240
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,960
How will you handle it?

241
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,079
You will find out soon enough.

242
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,079
Come with me.

243
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,599
Hello, Lak.

244
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Sure.

245
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,039
I have to go and meet her.
I hope it's good news.

246
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Of course.

247
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,239
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

248
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,079
- Be careful next time.
- I'm really sorry.

249
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,360
I also hit him in the back.

250
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,960
Unless he is super tough,
it should still hurt.

251
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,840
Lan, let go.

252
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,079
Did you even think of
telling me about the contract?

253
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,400
If Lak hadn't told me,

254
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,239
I guess this would have
remained a secret forever,

255
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,960
or I would've found out
on the day of the divorce.

256
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,199
If you were me,
would you tell anyone?

257
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,679
Marrying for a house.

258
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,960
It's just like what you said to me,
that I sell my body.

259
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,400
You didn't marry for the house.

260
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,960
You did it for your family.

261
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,840
The house is the agreement
made between you and my dad.

262
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,719
He can spend his money
however he wants.

263
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,000
If there's a change, you have to
discuss it with him, not my sister.

264
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,800
Shall I go to him now
and end this whole thing?

265
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,239
It will end
only when the term is over.

266
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:40,039
You should feel happy to be free.

267
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,960
Won't you regret losing your house?

268
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,639
You were willing
to do anything to keep it.

269
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,079
Why are you letting it go now?

270
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,199
What do you want me to do?

271
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,440
Should I endure it,

272
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:12,679
letting my feelings get hurt?

273
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:16,280
What about the attacker?

274
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,320
I can't do it anymore, Lan.

275
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,280
(Lak)

276
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,920
(Marriage Contract)

277
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:01,719
Find the person who sent me this.

278
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,519
This contract was made
between my father and Praomook.

279
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,920
If the sender managed to
take a picture of the contract,

280
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,320
it could be someone close to them.

281
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,159
I can't believe she would do that.

282
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,639
She almost agreed to get a divorce,
but Lan didn't let her.

283
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,519
I guess he's lost his senses.

284
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,079
He may have a plan.

285
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,679
I don't think he does.

286
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,119
He just wants to protect her.

287
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,960
(The number is registered
under Treenuch's name.)

288
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:23,280
I may need your help.

289
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,159
End their marriage.
I don't care how.

290
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,119
I can do it.

291
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,760
I'm just scared that
it would upset your father.

292
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,840
I don't want to have
a problem with him.

293
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:38,800
Don't worry.

294
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,559
I will deal with my father.

295
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,920
You're a capable woman.

296
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,840
More importantly, Lan loves you.

297
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,199
My parents will eventually
accept you as their daughter-in-law.

298
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:02,559
Talk to Lan.

299
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,960
Find a way to change his mind.

300
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,559
Alright, I will talk to him.

301
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,360
I'm going to take a shower.

302
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,119
I don't like your perfume.

303
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,039
Stop wearing it.

304
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,639
If you don't do that,
I will handle it myself.

305
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,159
(The number is registered
under Treenuch's name.)

306
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,239
Treenuch.

307
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:27,760
Danai.

308
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,960
I heard about the assault.

309
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,239
What happened?
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,559
I didn't want you to worry.

311
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,920
You didn't want me to worry,

312
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,519
or you didn't want me to know it
wasn't some thug who attacked you.

313
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,079
If it wasn't,
what would you do about it?

314
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,360
I will catch your attacker
and send him to jail. That's it.

315
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:02,639
You knew.

316
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,079
That's right. Mook told me.

317
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,719
She was very worried,
so she came to tell me

318
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,760
to keep an eye on things.

319
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,719
I sent someone to investigate it,
but I got nothing.

320
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:26,039
Then Mook was attacked.

321
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,760
I didn't think it would happen.

322
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:40,239
I don't think he will stop here.

323
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,639
For her safety,

324
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,400
you and Mook have to stay
at our family's condo for now.

325
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,599
The place should be more secured
than Rut's house or hers.

326
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Alright.

327
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,199
I will keep her safe.

328
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,320
I have to talk to you.

329
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Alright.

330
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,960
The security at this place
is tight and transparent.

331
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,599
There is only one entrance and exit,

332
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,280
which should be better than
our house that has several exits.

333
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,599
Right. This place looks secure.

334
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,880
You should stay with her.

335
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,280
For her safety, we need someone
to be on watch 24/7.

336
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,039
Oak can stay with me.

337
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,360
That way, it won't disturb
Rut's and your time.

338
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,559
Then who will stay with your mother?

339
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,760
Just do as I say.

340
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,840
- What do you say, Rut?
- Alright.

341
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,039
I will stay here.

342
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,159
I want you to be careful
of your brother-in-law.

343
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,840
We don't know how he hurt his back.

344
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,760
It's better to be on guard.

345
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,440
Can we check his travel records?

346
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,920
Yes, we can.
I told Poom to check Rawin's.

347
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,559
Check Danai's too.

348
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Alright.

349
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:39,559
(Nuch)

350
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:38,960
Hey. I have something
interesting to tell you.

351
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,559
Look at this.

352
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:48,519
I think Nuch and Danai
seem suspiciously close.

353
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,800
Assuming they were discussing work,

354
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,079
their eyes, body language,

355
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:54,880
and posture were too relaxed.

356
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,360
They could be more than co-workers.

357
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,719
How close do you think they are?

358
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:04,679
I don't know.

359
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,320
But I'm sure
they're more than co-workers.

360
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,559
Should we tell Lan about this?

361
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,199
Without solid evidence,

362
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,440
he would be mad if I told him.

363
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,280
It's a lose-lose situation.

364
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:23,239
What should we do then?

365
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:27,840
It's best to do nothing.

366
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,880
What? Don't you
want to know the truth?

367
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,199
This is between Lan and Nuch.
Let them handle it on their own.

368
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,119
Did you give up on him?

369
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,440
It's time.

370
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,280
I've given up.

371
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:10,360
Dear, I have a bad feeling.
I'm worried about both of them.

372
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,239
Da is stressed. She is scared
Mook will be attacked again.

373
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,840
Listen, I told them
to stay at the condo.

374
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,599
I asked security
to always stay alert.

375
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:26,599
If anything seems wrong,
they will inform me at once.

376
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,599
Dear, I'm not so sure
if we did the right thing

377
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:32,840
by asking Mook to marry our son.

378
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,119
Don't worry, dear.

379
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:37,679
There must be a solution to this.

380
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,400
I hope so.

381
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:21,280
Dad told Lan and Mook
to move to the condo.

382
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,039
For what?

383
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:29,639
I don't know. I guess he doesn't
want them to stay at Rut's.

384
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:34,000
So he gave them the condo.

385
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,679
Now that he gave them his condo,

386
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,360
who knows what
he will give them next.

387
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:48,480
If you can't end their marriage,

388
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,719
we will lose even more.

389
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,920
If you can't be useful,
stop talking.

390
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:05,639
Just do your job
and don't make any mistakes.

391
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,480
I can handle Mook.

392
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,519
I won't let her
take anything from me.

393
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,159
I won't make mistakes.

394
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,280
Mook.

395
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:18,639
Yes?

396
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:20,440
I have something to show you.

397
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:23,280
What is it?

398
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,199
It's a game
your sister is developing.

399
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
What is it about?

400
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,840
"How To Be Romantic?"

401
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,039
This is an otome game.

402
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,119
As expected of her.

403
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,079
Right, as expected of the brat.

404
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:58,480
I can't believe she created this.

405
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,039
She has a talent in this field.

406
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,599
She is highly creative.

407
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:09,480
With constant training,
she could create more fun games.

408
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,119
If this game is a success,

409
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,920
I'm going to give her
a percentage of the sales.

410
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,239
Then she will probably brag to you
about how she can make money.

411
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,920
She will brag about both the game
and the money. She likes to brag.

412
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,679
Anyway, thank you
for giving her the opportunity.

413
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Sure.

414
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:46,599
- Here. Let me show you how to play.
- Alright.

415
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,239
- Well, there are these characters.
- Okay.

416
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,719
It's like a game

417
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,320
where you're romantic virtually,

418
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,159
but it's actually an experiment
in the game.

419
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,559
However, it's like being
romantic in real life.

420
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:02,800
How do I be romantic?

421
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,360
- Here. You will do missions.
- Okay.

422
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,719
And the number of hearts
will increase after each mission.

423
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,400
- So I'm a girl going after a guy.
- You got it.

424
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:17,840
Alright.

425
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,920
Hey, Nuch.

426
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,840
I have to discuss work with you.

427
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,400
And I want to see you.

428
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,639
Can you come to my place?

429
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,800
Sure. I will see you there.

430
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:47,719
Okay.

431
01:05:58,679 --> 01:05:59,920
I'm going out.

432
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,599
Take care of Mook.

433
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,760
You shouldn't go out by yourself.

434
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,239
I will be with Nuch.
It will be fine.

435
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,199
Excuse me.

436
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,639
Lan.

437
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:09,880
How can you leave me alone with her?

438
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,079
I'm giving you an opening.

439
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,599
You won't feel a thing
if she falls in love with me?

440
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,639
I can't dictate how people feel.

441
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,360
Be honest with me.

442
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:29,039
You love Mook, don't you?

443
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,480
Ignore my feelings.

444
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,159
Our rule is
don't love the same girl.

445
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:50,559
I don't love Praomook.

446
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,199
Are you happy?

447
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,719
So far you haven't been
honest with me.

448
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,519
If you think not loving her
will solve everything,

449
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,280
go ahead.

450
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,480
Go be with whoever you want.

451
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,400
I will take care of her.

452
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,840
Remember my hatred.

453
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,399
You will face it
for the rest of your life.

454
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,399
I told you before. Even if
you're the only woman left,

455
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,239
I won't take an interest in you.

456
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,479
I should stop myself right here.

457
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,880
Are you worried about
how other people may feel?

458
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,399
I am.

459
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:24,119
You told me to stop
running away from Nuch.

460
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:28,649
So I asked myself and got an answer.

461
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:30,960
Nuch is important to me.

462
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,199
I don't love Praomook.

463
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,569
If you think not loving her
will solve everything, go ahead.

464
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:53,840
Go be with whoever you want.

465
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:56,760
I will take care of her.

466
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:27,359
When you're with me,

467
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,920
you don't have to act strong.

468
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,960
- Answer me.
- I didn't do it.

469
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:42,199
- Lan.
- Hey!

470
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,800
Rut!

471
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:26,039
Do you still like Mook?

472
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:27,399
Why do you ask?

473
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:30,399
I want to know
if you've changed your mind.

474
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:45,840
Can't I take a peek?

475
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:47,720
Don't be self-conscious.

476
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:50,039
Nuch.

477
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,529
I should go home.

478
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,800
Okay.

479
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:06,319
Oh.

480
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,760
What's wrong?

481
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,279
I'm fine. You should go home.

482
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,720
Oh.

483
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,079
Is it your stomach?

484
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:28,479
Yes.

485
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:07,399
It's good to have you by my side.

486
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,960
Lan.

487
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:43,399
Duckling.

488
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:55,119
It's me, not the person
you're thinking of.

489
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:06,680
You should wash up.
I will prepare breakfast.

490
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:44,159
You should watch Treenuch
and Danai's relationship closely.

491
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,479
What Oak and I saw
looked suspicious.

492
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,399
They barely talked
in front of you, right?

493
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,920
From what we saw,
they seemed intimate.

494
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,039
The day Poom brought her medicine,
a cleaner said she lives alone,

495
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,960
but that a guy would
visit her occasionally,

496
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,760
mostly at night.

497
01:18:28,529 --> 01:18:30,479
The cleaner doesn't know who he is.

498
01:18:30,609 --> 01:18:32,920
She saw him sometimes,
but couldn't see his face.

499
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:47,649
What are you looking for?

500
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:52,569
I'm looking for a towel.

501
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,880
Here you go.

502
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,199
I will find you a toothbrush.

503
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,039
Do you live here alone?

504
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:52,760
What do you mean?

505
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:56,529
I mean, does your family
visit you sometimes?

506
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,569
I live alone.

507
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:05,479
If you're worried,
you can move in with me.

508
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:09,529
Sounds interesting.

509
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,119
I will consider it.

510
01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:45,800
What are you doing?

511
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:47,609
I slapped you.

512
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,960
I want to know how thick your skin
is since you won't leave Lan alone.

513
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:55,479
You aren't any different
from a prostitute.

514
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:58,359
He told me about
your pathetic contract.

515
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,649
That's for insulting me.

516
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:09,680
You!

517
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,960
You have no right to judge whether
the contract is pathetic or not.

518
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:18,039
It means you're insulting the person
who helped me, which is Lan's dad.

519
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:20,279
And I'm not a prostitute.

520
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,609
Drop the good daughter-in-law act.
There's no audience here.

521
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,569
No one to feel grateful
for your protectiveness.

522
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,239
Is that all you have to say?

523
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,479
If people knew the reason
behind your marriage,

524
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,529
wouldn't you feel ashamed?

525
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,199
A daughter-in-law who can be
bought with a house.

526
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:53,609
Interesting, don't you think?

527
01:21:57,529 --> 01:22:00,159
You may be able to endure it
because you're shameless.

528
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:02,359
But I wonder if Lan's parents can.

529
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,159
Stop with your disgusting thoughts.

530
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:12,399
If it helps me get Lan,

531
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:14,840
I won't give up.

532
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,439
I talked to Mook.
I don't know if she will listen.

533
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,720
If she has a conscience,
she should feel ashamed of herself.

534
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,039
If she doesn't get it,
you can keep warning her.

535
01:22:47,649 --> 01:22:49,840
Put more pressure on her.
I know you can.

536
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:51,439
Okay.

537
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,649
When you're no use to me,

538
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,569
I will get rid of you.

539
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,840
Come in.

540
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:37,479
I need to talk to you.

541
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,960
What is it?

542
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:48,399
I want to get a divorce
as soon as possible.

543
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,569
Can you tell me one good reason

544
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:01,680
for the divorce?

545
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,840
It's to protect Mook.

546
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:13,079
Okay.

547
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,279
I need to talk to you.

548
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:45,399
Me too.

549
01:24:46,609 --> 01:24:47,720
Then I will go first.

550
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:52,569
Let's get a divorce.

551
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,399
Alright.

552
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:08,720
You can choose the date.

553
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,000
How about today?

554
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,760
You will finally be free from me.

(Praomook Wongnuannang)

556
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,529
(Chalantorn Anantanapat)

557
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:06,840
(Divorce Certificate)

558
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,279
(Divorce Certificate)

559
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:54,640
Did she get anything?

560
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,920
She wouldn't accept anything.

561
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:58,680
Dad's possessions are intact.
Are you happy?

562
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,800
Very.

563
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,680
All the evidence points to Rawin.

564
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,159
Win, stay calm.

565
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,479
If there is an investigation,
try to stall it.

566
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,439
I will deal with the rest.

567
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,479
Be careful and don't get caught.

568
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,479
If you want to take care of Mook,
tell me the truth.

569
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,039
Do you love her?

570
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:21,760
Take care of her for me.
