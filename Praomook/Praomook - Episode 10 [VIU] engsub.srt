00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,680
(Previous Episode)

4
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,840
Mook, what's wrong?

5
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,280
Dad went into cardiac arrest.

6
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,639
Goodbye, Dad.

7
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,039
This is where we part.

8
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,439
Start your journey before me.

9
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,479
And one day I will follow you.

10
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,639
During this time,
you should be by her side,

11
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,199
consoling her, reassuring her.

12
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,319
It's not my place.

13
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,919
You're her husband.

14
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,719
A husband who doesn't love her.

15
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,080
So I don't have a duty to fulfill.

16
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,280
It's actually a good thing
that you're mean to her.

17
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
The more you hate her,

18
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
the greater chance I have
of making her fall in love with me.

19
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,319
I will begin my own game.

20
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,400
And I'm sure that in this game

21
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,280
I will be the winner.

22
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,479
You keep haunting me
even when you're not here.

23
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
- Hey, Mom.
- Lan.

24
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Where are you and
what are you doing?

25
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,279
Is Mook with you?

26
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,279
I'm at Rut's house
and I'm about to go to bed.

27
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,480
Mook isn't with me.

28
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,610
If you're asking me
to go see her, I won't go.

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,079
But...

30
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,959
It's okay if you don't want to go.
I'm not saying anything.

31
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,800
Besides, I don't want to
disturb your precious bedtime.

32
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,610
It's actually a good thing
to only care about yourself.

33
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,759
Are you sure that's not an insult?

34
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,279
It's absolutely not an insult.

35
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,920
I just worry about her.

36
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,050
She might seem fine in front of us.

37
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,759
But she could be crying
when we're not around.

38
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,680
So I can't help but worry about her.

39
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,519
Look. I know you're trying
to make me feel sorry for her.

40
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,319
I'm not doing that.
I just think that

41
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,480
if she has you by her side,
I would be less worried.

42
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,959
I wouldn't be of any help.

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,959
You don't have to do anything.

44
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,800
Just stay by her side
and console her.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,079
Being partners in life means

46
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,839
when one falls,
the other is there to pick them up.

47
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,839
- But Mook and I aren't...
- In your case,

48
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,199
though you're not partners in life,

49
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,879
you two are childhood friends

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,560
who have been there for each other
and grew up together.

51
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,560
I know it doesn't really matter.

52
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,800
Besides, I believe
Mook can handle her emotions.

53
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,120
She can rely on herself
to cope with sadness.

54
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
In fact, you don't have to
be concerned about her.

55
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,279
I guess that's all I want to say.

56
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,199
It's late. Let's go to bed.

57
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,000
Good night. I love you.

58
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,160
Dear, we haven't...

59
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Mom?

60
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,920
- Take your hand off.
- What is it?

61
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,600
I can't speak
when you cover my mouth.

62
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,639
Dear, why didn't you just
tell him to go see her?

63
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,920
We already told him that at
the hospital, and did he listen?

64
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,079
No, he didn't.

65
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,319
Then why should we
keep pestering him to do it?

66
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,240
Don't you know your son?

67
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,439
The more he is pressured,
the more he resists.

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,720
That's why I believe hearing that
will make him worry about her.

69
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,399
I've raised him after all.

70
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,439
How did I get here?

71
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,639
Hey!

72
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,199
Well, are you here for Mook?

73
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,480
No. I'm just passing by.

74
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,399
I see. So, you're leaving.

75
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,519
Good night.

76
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,639
Wait.

77
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
What is it?

78
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,160
My mother asked me
to see how Mook is doing.

79
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,480
So I thought I should stop by
on my way home.

80
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,560
So you're not really
concerned about her.

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
No.

82
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,959
She is doing alright.

83
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,839
She's just locking herself in her
room and hasn't eaten anything.

84
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,439
I also heard the sound of
someone crying uncontrollably.

85
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,519
She must have no tears left to cry.

86
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,759
Do you call that doing alright?

87
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,720
Right, I'm worried that
she'll be overcome with grief.

88
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,839
She was close with her dad.

89
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,959
You aren't worried though.
You can head home. It's late.

90
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,120
Let's see if he still feels nothing
after hearing that.

91
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
He really feels nothing.

92
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,279
Mook,

93
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,399
eat something. You haven't
eaten since this morning.

94
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,759
You don't want to fall ill.

95
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm not hungry.

96
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,090
Please try.

97
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,919
Mook!

98
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,559
Mook, what's wrong?

99
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,360
Easy.

100
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,039
Lan.

101
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,360
When did he get here?

102
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,480
Oak, let's go.

103
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,639
Go where?

104
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Her husband is taking care of her.
Let's not be third wheels here.

105
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,840
- But...
- No buts.

106
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Come on. Let's go.

107
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,879
Come on, Oak.

108
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,279
Stay away from me.

109
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,840
You can't even stand upright.
Don't be arrogant.

110
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,639
I don't want you to see me
in this state.

111
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I've seen worse.

112
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,600
This is nothing.

113
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,879
No, I can walk on my own.

114
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,759
Don't be stubborn.

115
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
Just let me help.

116
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
I don't want to take you to
the doctor when you fall.

117
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,919
Your body is weak because
you haven't eaten anything.

118
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm not hungry.

119
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,600
You have to eat either way.
You just puked your guts out.

120
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,679
If you don't eat,
I will force it down your throat.

121
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Now, eat.

122
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,360
I can feed myself.

123
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,279
Do you like to be forced?

124
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,159
Here.

125
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,639
For your eyes.
They are horribly swollen.

126
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,639
Ow, hey!

127
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,759
You're exactly the same.

128
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,360
My baby.

129
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,360
My poor baby.

130
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,519
If your next life isn't good to you,

131
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,519
please be born as my baby again.

132
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
My poor baby.

133
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,039
It's just a guppy.
Do you have to be this sad?

134
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,960
Stop crying already.

135
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,559
My baby.

136
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,919
Puffy-eyed duckling.

137
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,840
- A cold compress for your eyes.
- Ow.

138
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,240
- No.
- You need it.

139
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Stay still.

140
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,360
If you don't apply a cold compress,
you'll look disgusting.

141
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,519
Why are you here?

142
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,200
My mother told me to check on you.

143
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,600
Since when did you start listening
to your mother?

144
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
Normally you are more defiant.

145
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,879
I've always listened to my mother.

146
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,159
If I don't listen, she'll scold me
until my next life.

147
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,519
Mothers are capable of that.

148
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,759
Now that you've done what
she asked of you, you can leave.

149
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,080
Are you kicking me out?

150
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,679
Yes. I have no energy left
to fight you.

151
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,919
If you don't start it,
I won't get into a fight with you.

152
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,639
What are you doing?

153
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,200
Thank you for checking on me.

154
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,279
For making me feel less alone.

155
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Many people are here for you.
You aren't alone.

156
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,440
I'd rather have you by my side.

157
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,319
You should go.

158
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,279
What's wrong with you? Asking me
to stay then kicking me out.

159
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,759
I don't want to force you today.

160
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,720
You can do whatever you want.

161
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,039
I will stay here tonight.

162
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Lan.

163
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,119
It's very late.
I don't want to drive home.

164
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm going to bed.

165
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,359
Mook, I can't sleep.
Can I stay with you?

166
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,960
Lan, how did you get here?

167
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,839
No, you can't stay the night here.

168
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You have to think of Rut.

169
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,000
I told him I'd stay the night here.

170
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,799
- So this bed is mine, okay?
- No.

171
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,039
I want to stay with her.
You go somewhere else.

172
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
- No.
- No.

173
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,519
- I want to sleep here.
- Stop yelling.

174
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,119
You want to sleep beside me,
don't you?

175
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,519
Then sleep on the bed.

176
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,000
Lan, you can choose
between the sofa and the floor.

177
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,000
Hold on. I'm your husband.

178
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,000
This is the best solution.

179
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,890
Let's go to sleep.

180
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm so sleepy.

181
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,279
Petch!

182
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Hey!

183
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,960
Mook, let's switch places.

184
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,839
Enough, Petch. Go to sleep.

185
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,240
Well,

186
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,720
we have a guest.

187
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,359
Auntie, good morning.

188
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,039
I'm going out. Want to join me?

189
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,319
No.

190
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
I will spend the night
somewhere else.

191
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Go ahead.

192
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,519
I didn't think you would stay here.

193
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,720
I made myself clear about
what I'm going to do with Mook.

194
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,799
But you're far from clear.

195
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,200
I did make myself clear.

196
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,559
If you want to pursue her,
that's fine with me.

197
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,079
I will give you another chance.

198
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,680
Let me know if you change
your mind about Mook.

199
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Our rule is
don't love the same girl.

200
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,279
If you like her, you can tell me.

201
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,119
I stand by what I've said.

202
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,240
I will never love Praomook.

203
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Good.

204
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,079
I don't want to stab someone
in the back.

205
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,640
And I don't like being
stabbed in the back either.

206
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
I will never betray my friends.

207
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,119
I will remember that.

208
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,519
(Treenuch is calling)

209
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,400
Nuch, do you need anything?

210
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm just wondering
if I came to the right place.

211
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,359
Nuch.

212
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,240
Hey, Lan.

213
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,440
How did you get here?

214
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,640
Alright.

215
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,319
Let's see who will last longer.

216
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,880
(Have a good day.)

217
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,920
(Rest in peace, Dad.)

218
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,480
Lak, do you know about
Mook's father's funeral?

219
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,960
I'd like to offer my friend
my condolences.

220
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,200
I saw it on Mook's post and searched
where the funeral would be held.

221
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
I'd like to offer my condolences.

222
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,440
We are friends after all.

223
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Could you take me to her?

224
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Sure.

225
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,279
Nuch, are you okay?

226
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
I don't know.

227
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,119
Ah, my ankle.

228
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,559
- Let's find you a seat.
- Okay.

229
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,880
Careful.

230
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,119
Da.

231
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,759
Thank you, Pat, Lim, and Lak

232
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,759
for coming here to send him off.

233
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,240
It's not a problem.

234
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,400
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to let us know.

235
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,000
We would be glad to help you.

236
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,880
What are you looking for?

237
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,880
Is there something wrong?

238
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,160
We're leaving. Could you fetch Lan?

239
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,359
I saw him heading that way.

240
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,319
Okay.

241
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Lan.

242
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,000
Why didn't you answer
any of my calls?

243
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,799
Did I do anything wrong?

244
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,079
If I did something
that offended you, I apologize.

245
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,759
I apologize for everything.

246
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,960
No, it's nothing. I was just busy.

247
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,559
Let me see your ankle.

248
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,279
Does it hurt?

249
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Ow.

250
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Does it hurt?

251
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Yes.

252
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,440
But I think it should be fine
after a little rest.

253
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,319
Are you sure?

254
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,519
I'm really okay.

255
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,279
I'm happy to see that
you worry about me.

256
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,079
This reminds me of the old days

257
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,440
when you used to take care of me.

258
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,160
Good job, pup.

259
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,799
Good job, pup.

260
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,359
Mook.

261
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,720
I was about to go find you.

262
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,079
I'm sorry about your loss.

263
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,809
Thanks for coming.

264
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,809
Would you like to send
my father off? I can take you there.

265
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
- Ah!
- Nuch, are you alright?

266
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,159
Careful.

267
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,329
I'm alright.

268
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,719
She probably didn't know
I hurt my ankle.

269
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
You can't be too sure.

270
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,360
She doesn't care about
people's feelings after all.

271
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,599
It could've been her intention.

272
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,199
It wasn't my intention.

273
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,599
Like I would believe you.

274
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,289
Lan, you're overreacting.

275
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:44,960
She didn't do anything.

276
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:47,360
I'm telling the truth.

277
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,960
You will soon realize that you
should stay away from this woman.

278
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,239
I will use my own judgment on that.

279
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,199
I don't have to be told.

280
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:58,960
It's fine, Rut.

281
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,119
In his eyes, I've never been good.

282
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,599
Excuse me.
I need to rest for a minute.

283
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,719
Go ahead.

284
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,079
You can ask Lan to take you there
when you're ready.

285
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:18,519
Thank you for your condolences.

286
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,920
I'll leave you two alone.

287
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,880
You told Treenuch to
come here, didn't you?

288
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,039
She wanted to come here.
I just answered her question.

289
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't agree with your attempt
to sabotage their relationship.

290
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,199
I haven't done anything.
They started the fight themselves.

291
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,639
I'm just pushing her
to get a divorce early.

292
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,599
I'm trying to help my brother here.

293
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,719
I know you, Lak.

294
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,329
If it doesn't benefit you,
you won't care.

295
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,159
If you know me,

296
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,920
you'd know not to get in my way
when I start doing something.

297
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,440
And you will help me.

298
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,079
- But...
- Danai.

299
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,679
Don't forget.

300
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,039
You got to where you are today
because of me.

301
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,119
So you should pay me back.

302
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,440
Just tell me what you need me to do.

303
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,880
I know you can do it.

304
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,880
I feel better now.

305
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I will walk you to your car.

306
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Okay.

307
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,289
Lan, I'm really okay.

308
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
It's fine.

309
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,159
This place is peaceful.

310
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Where is your brother?

311
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,440
- Dear.
- Hm?

312
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,519
There he is.

313
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,159
Does he have to carry her?

314
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,239
Is your friend okay?
Why does she have to be carried?

315
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,239
She fell and hurt her ankle.

316
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,960
I carried her here
so I can take her to her car later.

317
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,199
I see.

318
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:32,920
Excuse me.

319
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,119
Where does it hurt?

320
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:39,769
Ow.

321
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,480
- Lan, let me see her ankle.
- Lan, come here.

322
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:50,769
Wow. It's so swollen.

323
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,880
Shall I take you to a doctor?
I'm free today.

324
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,039
No.

325
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:02,880
I'm fine. I can go home
and take some medicine.

326
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,639
Are you sure you don't
want to see a doctor?

327
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,199
I'm sure.

328
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,360
- Oh.
- Hey.

329
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,769
Thank you for your concern.

330
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:29,440
See you later, Mook.
I'm sorry for your loss.

331
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:33,880
Thanks.

332
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,920
Mom, let's go home.

333
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,159
Please excuse us, Uncle, Auntie.

334
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,559
See you later.

335
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,719
Lan, I think you should follow Mook.

336
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,920
Your friend will be fine.

337
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,199
That's right. I can take care
of your friend for you. Alright?

338
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,960
Nuch, come on.
I'll walk you to the car.

339
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,519
Okay.

340
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,159
Dear, look at him.

341
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,199
- Dear.
- Hm?

342
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:07,519
What's wrong? You look stressed.

343
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,400
I'm stressed out.

344
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,440
Lan keeps causing me trouble
and it's driving me insane.

345
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,719
I got him a good wife
and he doesn't care.

346
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,809
You have to give them
some time to adjust.

347
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,199
Married couples make adjustments
throughout their entire marriage.

348
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:26,880
It's about taking
one step at a time.

349
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,119
It's not about
getting back at each other.

350
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,679
I'm telling you.
Life is unpredictable.

351
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:39,000
The only certainty is uncertainty.

352
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,920
We have to live each day
as if it were our last

353
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,480
because we may not have tomorrow.

354
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,519
Dear.

355
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,360
To tell you the truth,

356
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,719
I'm scared I'll end up like Pethai.

357
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,809
He wasn't prepared
to leave this world.

358
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,769
His kids aren't ready
to stand on their own two feet.

359
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,119
If it were me,

360
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,599
I wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

361
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,880
So, are you stressed because
you're worried about your kids?

362
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
That's right.

363
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,440
I think

364
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,480
it's time I make myself clear.

365
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:29,809
What are you planning to do?

366
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:42,809
We have a lot of memories
of this house.

367
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,440
I was shocked when I found out
we were going to lose it.

368
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,159
I tried everything to save it,

369
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:52,440
hoping that one day
when Dad woke up,

370
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,360
he would still have this house,

371
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,639
and we would start over.

372
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,809
But now that Dad is gone,

373
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,679
it makes me feel like
I can't lose this house.

374
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,400
This house represents him.

375
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,289
I will do everything I can
to take it back.

376
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,719
I will endure.

377
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:23,769
You mean with Lan.

378
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:25,920
Are you sure you can do it?

379
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
I'm sure.

380
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,639
Then I will give you
another thing to worry about.

381
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,719
What is it?

382
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:42,000
Next Friday night? Sure.

383
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:44,320
I'll let DJ Prao know.

384
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,599
I don't agree with your attempt
to sabotage their relationship.

385
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,840
I haven't done anything.
They started the fight themselves.

386
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,000
You can't make two people who
hate each other fall in love.

387
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,599
I'm just pushing her
to get a divorce early.

388
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm trying to help my brother here.

389
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,719
I know you, Lak.

390
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,280
If it doesn't benefit you,
you won't care.

391
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,480
Besides Treenuch, you have to
be careful of Lak and Danai.

392
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,199
You have enemies on all sides.

393
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:28,920
Good. That sounds fun.

394
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:34,280
The more they want to get rid of me,
the more I want to stay.

395
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,199
I will persevere and make it
through this year.

396
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,119
It's quiet in here.

397
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:16,239
Cold and distant atmosphere,

398
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:18,840
like the house owner.

399
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,079
If you prefer a place
with loud noises, you can leave.

400
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,480
It's peaceful here.

401
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,239
I'll get the door.

402
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,960
Lan, you have a parcel.

403
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:00,280
What's in there?

404
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,920
Some documents from the factory.
I asked for them.

405
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,119
I need these documents
for the past seven years.

406
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,800
Send them to this address
as soon as possible.

407
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,039
What are you going to do with them?

408
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,119
I want to see the budgets
and how they have been allocated.

409
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
Okay.

410
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,960
Please keep this between us.

411
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,960
Of course, Chalantorn.

412
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,159
If you check the last five years,
you should find it.

413
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:15,320
I just want to read through it
in case I find something.

414
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,679
From what I previously found,

415
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,239
the profit stays the same while
product amount looks strange.

416
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,800
It could begin at the factory.

417
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,519
Like that time I read my dad's email
and told Lak about it.

418
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,880
Right, I remember that.

419
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,000
But how can you be sure
that these documents are authentic?

420
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:41,960
These are just for my reference.

421
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,719
Because I will have our hacker
search for the real ones.

422
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,840
You can trust my hacking skills.

423
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,320
I will find you the real data.

424
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,960
I can detect forgery.

425
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,840
It's never a secret
when you say it's a secret.

426
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,800
The culprit will hear
about my request for the documents.

427
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,440
There are no secrets in the world.

428
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,760
If there are people behind this,

429
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,320
the incident at the factory
wasn't an accident.

430
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,199
It's a possibility.

431
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,119
If you were attacked for this,
I think it's too risky.

432
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,320
Your life is in extreme danger.

433
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,440
You need to have a plan
before you do something.

434
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,719
Don't challenge them.

435
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,960
My plan is to put pressure on them,
making them reveal themselves,

436
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,360
and end this as soon as possible.

437
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,440
Good. If you win, you survive.

438
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Your father's company is safe.

439
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,199
That's right. I must win.

440
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:24,320
- Ting, where is my mom?
- Oh.

441
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,480
Petch, why do you look like that?

442
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,360
You know why.

443
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,519
Oh, my poor girl.

444
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,199
You can be sad,
but there must be a limit.

445
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
I know.

446
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,280
Where is my mom anyway?

447
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,719
Right, Pat picked her up
this morning.

448
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,239
She said she would come back
in the evening.

449
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,960
Pat is a nice lady.

450
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,119
She doesn't want Da to get lonely,
so she hangs out with her every day.

451
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:57,599
You too, Petch.

452
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:00,800
You can't mope around all day.

453
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,199
It gives me a bad feeling.

454
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,320
Have you eaten? I made breakfast.

455
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,400
It's over there.

456
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,559
Petch.

457
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:13,639
Petch.

458
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,239
Where did she go?

459
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:24,119
Where are you guys going?

460
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,800
I'm driving Mook to the house
of her husband's friend.

461
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,119
I don't want her husband to
forget that he has a wife.

462
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
See you later.

463
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
I'm going with you.

464
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,119
Why would you want to go with me?

465
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,400
I don't want to be alone.

466
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,760
I miss Dad.

467
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
I'll help you.

468
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,960
The figures don't match.

469
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,880
Hey, guys.
I was just thinking about you.

470
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,719
We've brought food for dinner.

471
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,199
That's great.
I was wondering what's for dinner.

472
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,639
Where are Lan and Rut?

473
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,639
They're working.

474
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,239
Here. Let me help you.

475
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,519
Oak, you can let go.

476
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,280
I'll get this.

477
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Come in.

478
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,159
Poom, where is Rut?

479
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,519
He is with Lan.

480
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,159
Are we disturbing them? I feel bad.

481
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,960
Come on, Petch.
We've disturbed them several times.

482
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:16,639
It's too late for regrets now.

483
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,960
Well, they might want to
enjoy their time with each other.

484
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,079
I don't think they're enjoying it.
Why don't you check it out?

485
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,320
I will fetch them for you.

486
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:38,760
Let's see that one.

487
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,400
Who's here?

488
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,840
Mook and her team.

489
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,400
Her team.

490
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,960
Petch and Oak.

491
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,760
She shouldn't have come back.
This is annoying.

492
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,840
It's a good thing she's here.
Now I can take care of her 24/7.

493
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:10,199
Boss.

494
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:15,880
I have a question about
this investigation.

495
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,639
Should we let Mook know about this?

496
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,199
I mean, the documents are
scattered all over the room.

497
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,400
This should be kept from her.

498
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,119
The less she knows, the better.

499
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
Rut.

500
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,920
Mook.

501
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:00,719
Rut.

502
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,679
Well, please don't mind me.

503
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,440
Make yourself at home.
My house is your house.

504
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:22,280
By the way, where is Lan?

505
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,519
He isn't hungry. We can eat first.

506
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,719
Enjoy the meal.

507
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,880
Thanks.

508
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,679
I'll be right back.

509
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,960
Why are you here?

510
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:36,800
I'm here to ask you
to join us for dinner.

511
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,159
Whether I eat or not
is my business, not yours.

512
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Hey.

513
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,159
You've been avoiding me.

514
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,079
Do you think you can keep
running away?

515
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,039
Not seeing your face
makes my mind feel at ease.

516
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,760
But I want to see your face.
It gives me an appetite.

517
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Come on. Let's go eat.

518
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,960
Can you stop bothering me?

519
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
Hey!

520
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:46,239
Lan.

521
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,719
I want to be near you.

522
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:54,800
Do you miss me?

523
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,239
If there are people behind this,

524
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,360
the incident at the factory
wasn't an accident.

525
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,519
Being near me is dangerous.

526
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,760
If you are out of my life,
you will be safe.

527
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,199
No, I don't miss you.

528
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,800
Are you hurt?

529
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,800
I'm fine. I'm a tough woman.

530
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,960
I'm thick-skinned. This is nothing.

531
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,159
Hey, just eat.

532
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,400
Don't worry about the others.
They'll eat when they feel like it.

533
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,800
Why don't you try this? It's good.

534
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,840
Oak, can you reach this?
Let me get it for you.

535
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,760
(Latest Dream Guy: The Next
Vice President At LS Design)

536
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,679
Oh no. Here it comes.

537
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,159
Do we follow him or keep eating?

538
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,719
I say we keep eating.

539
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,960
Lan.

540
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,960
What's all the ruckus?

541
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,840
There is a rumor about you
on the internet.

542
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,519
The latest dream guy

543
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,519
or LS Design's next vice president,

544
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,920
Chalantorn Anantanapat,

545
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:37,679
the only son of Limpichat,

546
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,639
is rumored to become
the company's vice president soon.

547
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,840
What will Lim's elder child,
Laknara, say about this?

548
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:52,880
You leaked the news, didn't you?

549
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,320
What news?

550
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,039
The news about
Lan becoming vice president.

551
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:08,599
Come on, Lak. It's just a rumor.
Don't pay attention to it.

552
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,360
I don't believe you. They wouldn't
write about a baseless rumor.

553
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,760
You leaked the story
to see how our partners

554
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,360
and the board would react.

555
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,440
Very smart.

556
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:31,119
You're right. I leaked the story.

557
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,440
You want him to be vice president.

558
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,840
What about me?
What will be my position?

559
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,719
For now you're in the same position.
But I'll find you a new one soon.

560
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:47,440
You're saying it like I'm unsuitable
to take over the company.

561
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,480
Lak,

562
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,159
you're raising your voice at me.

563
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,840
If you can't control your emotions,
get a grip on yourself first.

564
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
Danai, get her to calm down.

565
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Alright.

566
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:03,559
Lak.

567
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,239
I think you should talk to him
when you're calmer.

568
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,079
No. I want to hear
his reasons right now.

569
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:15,960
Why do you refuse to
recognize my capability?

570
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,639
Lan does nothing and you're ready
to give him everything. It's unfair.

571
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:23,519
Lak.

572
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:27,360
I'm not handing over
the company to him.

573
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,920
You have the same
executive power I do.

574
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,320
You can run the company in my place.

575
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,039
Isn't that enough for you?

576
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:38,199
Listen.

577
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,159
The company doesn't belong to you.

578
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,639
It belongs to all of us.

579
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,480
I just want Lan to be
part of the company. That's all.

580
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,880
It's clear that he doesn't want to
work with us but you don't listen.

581
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:56,159
He was born lucky.
He's never had to struggle.

582
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,840
You're doing this because
I'm a woman, aren't you?

583
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:01,880
- That's not true.
- You're lying.

584
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:05,639
You don't care about me
because I'm a woman.

585
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,119
You never recognize my worth
no matter how hard I try.

586
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,639
Lak, why don't you believe me?

587
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,480
The way you are acting right now
has confirmed my expectations.

588
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,719
You're emotional and unreasonable.
You look down on yourself.

589
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:23,559
You don't listen to anyone.

590
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,880
If you keep acting like this,

591
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,920
it will be a long time until
I can accept you. Remember that.

592
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,039
Dad.

593
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:33,159
Danai.

594
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:35,599
Get her out of here.

595
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,440
Now!

596
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,760
Okay.

597
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Lak, please come with me.

598
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,320
Dad.

599
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,639
- You have to listen to me.
- Come on, Lak.

600
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,760
- You can't do this to me.
- Just come with me, please.

601
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,199
Dear, what happened?
I could hear you from the gate.

602
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:55,679
Dear, it's Lak.

603
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,400
She yelled at me
for making Lan vice president.

604
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:01,199
I don't know what's wrong with her.

605
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,920
Dear, nothing's wrong with her.

606
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,400
She just wants to know
why you did that.

607
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:12,719
I told you to take it
one step at a time, didn't I?

608
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:18,800
You have to see things
from her perspective.

609
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:24,599
Has anyone ever seen things
from my perspective?

610
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:26,639
Has anyone done that?

611
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,079
I have.

612
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,039
I agree with you. I'm here for you.

613
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,480
Come on. Let's calm down.

614
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,400
Please.

615
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,119
It's just a rumor.

616
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,840
I don't think it's unfounded.

617
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,079
If I were to guess,

618
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,280
it's my father who leaked the news.

619
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,280
I won't waste my time complaining
because I won't accept the position.

620
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,960
But it's your father's company.

621
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,000
You should continue his work.

622
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,280
I didn't ask for your opinion.

623
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:05,119
I will give you my opinion anyway.

624
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,239
No matter how hard
you try to run away,

625
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,360
you will eventually do it
for your family.

626
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:14,480
This is my life. I can handle it.
I don't need help.

627
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,280
I will give you another chance.

628
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,880
Let me know if you change
your mind about Mook.

629
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:31,320
Our rule is
don't love the same girl.

630
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:32,960
I stand by what I've said.

631
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,079
I will never love Praomook.

632
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,599
Good.

633
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,320
I don't want to stab someone
in the back.

634
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:42,440
And I don't like being
stabbed in the back either.

635
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
There's one thing you can do for me.

636
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,280
Lak, calm down.

637
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,679
Shut up, Danai.

638
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:03,960
If you can't help me,
leave me alone.

639
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,239
- Can you be reasonable?
- I said shut up.

640
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,639
You're partly the reason
why it has come to this.

641
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,719
If you were more capable,

642
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,599
the vice president position
would be either mine or yours.

643
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,480
You're right. It's my fault.

644
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,159
You've done nothing wrong.

645
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,400
But Dad told you.

646
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,039
The company belongs to all of us.

647
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,480
It doesn't belong to one person.

648
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:39,119
Lan may be irresponsible,
but one day he will change.

649
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:40,559
I don't want to listen to you.

650
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,159
- Please.
- Get out.

651
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,039
I want to be alone.

652
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,519
- Come on. Calm down.
- Get out.

653
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,400
Get out, Danai, now.

654
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,840
Get out.

655
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,679
Get out.

656
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,199
I will show you

657
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,480
how wrong you are, Dad.

658
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:03,480
Help me choose. Leave this house,
or I will leave myself.

659
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,920
From now on, if there's you,
there's no me.

660
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,840
I'm not going anywhere.

661
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,960
I go wherever you go.

662
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,440
No. You must choose.

663
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,439
I'm getting back together with Nuch.

664
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:20,159
And what she will be? Your mistress?

665
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,920
She isn't my mistress.
She is a woman I once loved.

666
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:27,039
No.

667
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,439
I might still love her.

668
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,960
Do you think
I will fall for your tricks?

669
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,609
I know you're using her to hurt me.

670
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,880
You're wrong. I don't feel a thing.

671
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,119
I've never felt a thing for you.

672
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,079
I've only been around you
in order to beat you.

673
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,880
So my answer is
I'm not going anywhere.

674
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,119
Then I'll go.

675
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
Lan,

676
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:07,359
where are you going?

677
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,760
Mind your own business.

678
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,720
Lan.

679
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,720
Lan, hold on.

680
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,609
I'm not letting you leave.

681
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:31,800
You can't control me.

682
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:34,880
This marriage
isn't a result of love.

683
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:36,319
It's full of hatred.

684
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,279
It's best for us to
stay away from each other.

685
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,079
I don't need you in my life.

686
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,239
I only need Nuch.

687
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:52,880
If you think mentioning her name
can hurt me,

688
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:56,039
or make me want a divorce,
you're mistaken.

689
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,079
I don't feel a thing.

690
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:01,439
I will be with you wherever you go
until our contract is up.

691
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:03,529
I don't need you.

692
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:06,960
I've realized now that my heart
never forgot about her.

693
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,079
Rut,

694
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,840
you told me to stop
running away from Nuch.

695
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,439
I've asked myself

696
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:18,399
and got my answer.

697
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:20,840
Nuch is important to me.

698
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,569
So you chose Treenuch.

699
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,159
That's right.

700
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,609
If I pursue Mook,
you will be fine with that, right?

701
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,529
- That's right.
- What?

702
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,199
What's going on?

703
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,119
Lan and Treenuch.

704
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:44,960
Rut is going to pursue my sister.

705
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,720
Did you two break up
and start liking women now?

706
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:54,880
The relationship between me and him

707
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,609
is a lie we created
to reject the marriage.

708
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,239
We're just friends.

709
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,079
We're men,

710
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:06,319
straight men.

711
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,649
From now on,

712
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:18,760
I will pursue you.

713
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:29,039
I'm a man of my word.

714
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:33,609
You can do whatever you want.
You have my permission.

715
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:37,760
Giving permission like that,
do you think you own me?

716
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:41,920
This is between me and Rut.
You have no say in this.

717
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:44,609
You're right.

718
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:46,529
I have my life. You have yours.

719
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,649
You have no say in who I hang out
or fall in love with.

720
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,439
No way. Rut,
you can't pursue my sister.

721
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:57,800
Lan, you can't see another woman.
It's wrong.

722
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:01,529
How is it wrong?

723
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:05,119
Although this is a mock marriage,

724
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,649
they registered their marriage.
They are husband and wife.

725
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,920
But they don't love each other.

726
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,399
Love isn't the point.

727
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,960
The point is if you pursue her
and she develops feelings for you,

728
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:21,529
you will become an adulterer by law.

729
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:26,609
An adulterer means

730
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:32,279
one who has an affair
with someone else's spouse.

731
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:35,399
- According to the Civil and...
- Enough.

732
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,439
An example of adultery is
touching someone else's spouse.

733
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:49,609
I think just touching her
is considered adultery.

734
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,569
Or sleeping with them,

735
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,800
either in a public or private place,
is considered adultery by law.

736
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,039
A mistress is

737
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:03,649
a woman who has an affair
with a married man.

738
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:08,439
A wife can sue the mistress
for compensatory damages.

739
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,439
You can also file for divorce.
You will definitely win.

740
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:14,840
Sounds interesting.

741
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:17,529
If you want her, you can go ahead.

742
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,399
I will collect evidence
to incriminate you.

743
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,800
I will file for divorce
and sue you for compensation.

744
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:25,319
It will be more than eight-figures.

745
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,159
Wait, Oak, should I ask for nine?

746
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,960
Let's go for ten.

747
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:31,760
Shall I get a lawyer?

748
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:33,680
You're a greedy woman.

749
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,840
Money is more useful than
an unfaithful husband.

750
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,840
If you want to get
back together with her,

751
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:42,529
you will have to wait.
Because I won't let it happen.

752
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,079
You told me to suffer with you.

753
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:50,960
Now I'm suffering with you
and you will never get to be happy.

754
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:54,279
Endure it because
there's nothing else you can do.

755
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,279
Alright. But I've had
enough of you today.

756
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,319
I'm going to see the person I love.

757
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:11,880
Lan, you're not going anywhere.

758
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:15,159
- Lan, hey!
- Mook.

759
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:18,159
- Rut, let go.
- Mook, calm down.

760
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:19,399
Mook,

761
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,479
you should let him go for now.

762
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,920
You two can talk once you've
calmed down.

763
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:31,880
If pretending to be gay didn't work,
you don't have to try to hit on me.

764
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,840
If you want to help your friend,
try another way.

765
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:36,239
I don't like it.

766
01:14:37,649 --> 01:14:39,760
- Wait, Mook. What I said...
- Rut.

767
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,159
We need to talk.

768
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:50,800
Mook, wait for me.

769
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,159
Where should I go now?

770
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:11,359
Hey.

771
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,880
Hey.

772
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:19,279
You aren't allowed
to pursue my sister.

773
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,000
I'm your boss.
Who are you to order me around?

774
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,079
I'm saying this as her sister.

775
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,359
What you're trying to do
isn't right.

776
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:29,649
It's immoral and illegal.

777
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:32,359
I'm just trying to create up
an opportunity for myself.

778
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,039
I'm not trying to
take advantage of her.

779
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:37,399
Lan doesn't love her.
They'll divorce after a year.

780
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:40,159
A lot can change in a year.

781
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:43,239
You shouldn't try to
get between them.

782
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:46,399
Lan made it clear
that he doesn't love her.

783
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:49,399
So, I have the right to pursue her.

784
01:15:51,569 --> 01:15:53,880
I can't believe
your logic is so awful.

785
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:56,840
You're not the man I know.

786
01:15:58,649 --> 01:16:00,439
You're just a part-time employee.

787
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,569
How well can you know me?

788
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,920
You think I'm a good man,
a gentleman, don't you?

789
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:10,920
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

790
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:13,720
I'm just a human being.

791
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:17,760
I guess an inexperienced kid
like you wouldn't understand.

792
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:21,439
I'm not a kid anymore.

793
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,399
You're under 18.
To me, you're a kid.

794
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,279
You wouldn't understand adult love.

795
01:16:29,569 --> 01:16:33,439
I'd rather be a kid forever than
become an immoral person like you.

796
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,479
When you grow up, you will realize
righteousness doesn't always work.

797
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:41,319
Sometimes
you have to fight for love.

798
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:45,119
This is an adult matter.
Mind your own business.

799
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,159
Do you understand, kid?

800
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:16,920
Nampetch!

801
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:20,039
The wrong kind of love
won't make you happy.

802
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:22,479
I won't let you do
whatever you please.

803
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,159
If you want my sister,
you have to go through me.

804
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:29,720
You brat, you will pay for this.

805
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,159
I'm looking forward to it, Boss.

806
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,079
Petch, what happened?

807
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:43,119
Boss!

808
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,159
Boss, why are you in the pool?

809
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,800
She isn't my mistress.
She is a woman I once loved.

810
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:02,159
No.

811
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,359
I might still love her.

812
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:11,119
This marriage
isn't a result of love.

813
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:12,760
It's full of hatred.

814
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,199
I don't need you in my life.

815
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:18,319
I only need Nuch.

816
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,239
So you chose Treenuch.

817
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,239
If I pursue Mook,

818
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,439
you will be fine with that, right?

819
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,880
That's right.

820
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:30,649
I'm not your property.

821
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,119
You can't hand me over
to anyone, jerk.

822
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:38,000
Be honest with me.
Are you jealous of Treenuch?

823
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:40,680
I'm not jealous.

824
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:44,680
You still love him, don't you?

825
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,880
I don't love him.

826
01:18:50,609 --> 01:18:54,119
I'm mad at him for handing me over
to Rut when he has no right.

827
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:58,840
He thinks I'm an easy woman
who likes to sleep around.

828
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,439
It's irritating.

829
01:19:01,569 --> 01:19:04,920
I want to purify him and
get rid of his filthy mind.

830
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,399
Now, listen to me, Oak.

831
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:12,319
What? What did I do?

832
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,199
If you don't stop saying
that I love him,

833
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:17,760
I will smack you in the mouth.

834
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,159
Don't even think about it?

835
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,079
I'm not thinking about anything.

836
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:27,319
Anyway, what will you do next?
Will you stay or leave?

837
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,319
I'm stubborn. I will stay.

838
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:35,359
What about Rut pursuing you?
What will you do about it?

839
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:37,760
I don't trust him.

840
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:41,609
They are friends and have
already pretended to date.

841
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,279
Who knows what their next move is.

842
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,529
I agree with you.
You should be prepared.

843
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,720
Don't worry.

844
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,000
No matter how many tricks
they throw at me, I can handle it.

845

(Latest Dream Guy)

846
01:20:03,609 --> 01:20:08,000
(LS Design's Next Vice President)

847
01:20:21,569 --> 01:20:24,319
Vice president now.
Next is the president.

848
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:26,680
The single man of your dreams?

849
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,199
No one knows he's already taken.

850
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:32,319
Soon I will make you single again.

851
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:34,159
You belong to me and only me.

852
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,609
Why didn't you let me know
you were coming?

853
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:23,159
- Danai, what's wrong?
- Shut up.

854
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,119
Lan may have a suspicion

855
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,159
that you're dating someone.

856
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:07,800
Stay away from him.

857
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:11,199
What about the plan
to get them to divorce?

858
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,840
Let's hold off on it for now.

859
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,399
I'll take it from here.

860
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:37,239
What was the fight about this time?

861
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:39,760
You were

862
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,239
rather rough.

863
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:47,279
It's the same old thing.
It's annoying.

864
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,569
She would be very upset
if she heard you say that.

865
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:54,079
She doesn't care about me.

866
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:56,880
She only cares about herself.

867
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,039
It's alright.

868
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,920
You still have me. I care about you.

869
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,000
I told you to stop seeing Lan.

870
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:16,609
Why didn't you listen to me?

871
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:21,609
Lak still wants me to
ruin their marriage.

872
01:24:24,529 --> 01:24:25,760
Are you stupid?

873
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:28,039
He is watching you.

874
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,960
Stay away from him
and stop seeing him.

875
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,920
If Lak finds out
about our relationship,

876
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,119
she will destroy us.

877
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,359
What about the plan
to destroy their marriage?

878
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:45,569
Don't worry about that.
I will handle it.

879
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,079
Lan, I was thinking about you.
I'm glad you called.

880
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,159
I want to see you.
Can I come to your place?

881
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:40,039
I want to see you too.

882
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:42,529
But I'm out running errands.

883
01:25:42,649 --> 01:25:44,239
I don't know when I'll be finished.

884
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:46,119
I can wait.

885
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:48,800
I want to talk to you
about something.

886
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:54,760
I really can't make it today.

887
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:56,569
Can we talk tomorrow?

888
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,439
I have all day for you.

889
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:01,649
Alright.

890
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:05,960
See you later.
I'm glad you want to see me.

891
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:39,680
I refuse to stay like this forever.

892
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,479
You told me you weren't
seeing anyone.

893
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:50,159
What is this? You're married.

894
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,960
- Nuch.
- You lied to me.

895
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:56,279
Wait, Nuch. Let me explain.

896
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:58,039
No, we're over.

897
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,159
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about Lak.

898
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,319
I can't lose you.

899
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:06,439
You're selfish.
I refuse to be anyone's mistress.

900
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,720
Nuch, please. You're not a mistress.

901
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:18,199
You're number one in your own place.

902
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,159
We're happy together.

903
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:22,399
If you stay with me,

904
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,319
I will support you with everything.

905
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,000
Be it money

906
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,199
or your career, everything.

907
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:31,119
What do you say?

908
01:27:50,119 --> 01:27:53,119
Who would be stupid enough
to let go of a vice president?

909
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,640
Danai's car.

910
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,159
I want to wait until it's over.

911
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:46,880
You can do that if you want.

912
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:50,039
However, I have the right to
try and make you interested.

913
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,640
I will make you take off this ring

914
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:55,560
without regretting it.

915
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:57,920
Can you go back to living abroad?

916
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,279
Go back to do what you love
quickly before I

917
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,399
hate you.

918
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,880
I think you should deal with
the cause of this problem instead.

919
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:09,560
You mean...
