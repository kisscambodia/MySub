00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,359
(Praomook)

2
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,759
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,680
I have to find out who you are

4
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,240
and end this madness.

5
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
You have to figure out
who could be at a disadvantage

6
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,159
and have a lot to lose
from your return.

7
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,479
Lak.

8
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,919
For now, let him
try to absorb the fact

9
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,090
that his sister
is our prime suspect.

10
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,560
How much can you trust Treenuch?

11
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Fifty percent.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,439
I don't think you should trust her.

13
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,560
I've decided to step down
from that position.

14
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,319
You may be successful in life.

15
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
To me,

16
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,840
you're a bad father.

17
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Lan!

18
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Dear!

19
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,080
Why did you take me here?

20
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,919
To relieve your stress.

21
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,319
Your special order has arrived.

22
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm going home.

23
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Oh, you can't leave yet.

24
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,560
Mook has prepared
everything for you.

25
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,199
Do you want to ruin her plan?

26
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,719
Isn't that right, Mook?

27
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,719
Right.

28
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,039
This is for you. I don't want
you to get drunk somewhere else.

29
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,319
Think of it as
you're DJ Prao's VIP guest.

30
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,519
Do you want to try?

31
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Sure.

32
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Let me.

33
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Come here.

34
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,160
This is play control.

35
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,560
Mook is with him. Don't worry, Pat.

36
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,120
That's a relief.
Mook is always there for him.

37
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
Please take care of my son.

38
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Of course.

39
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,639
Thank you.

40
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I'm sorry.

41
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm sorry for looking down on you

42
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,680
and thinking that
you're an irresponsible person.

43
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,120
Today I saw that you don't
fool around with your life.

44
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,480
No matter what you do from now on,

45
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,240
I'm willing to support you
in everything.

46
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,399
What do you want in return?

47
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,079
I just want to watch you
go forward on your own.

48
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,560
Are you sure I can do that?

49
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,759
I believe in you.

50
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,240
I accept your apology.

51
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Thank you for believing in me.

52
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,559
Well.

53
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,759
You look much better now.

54
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,759
If you want to stay over,

55
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,210
you can stay in the studio.

56
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm selfish like you.

57
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
We're different.

58
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,480
I do what I do for my family,
for the company, for your future.

59
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
Have you ever asked me

60
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,559
if I want that future?

61
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,879
I don't want it.

62
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,200
You may be successful in life.

63
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,080
To me,

64
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,360
you're a bad father.

65
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,759
Lan!

66
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Dear!

67
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,399
Lan.

68
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,039
I'm sorry.

69
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,679
Can I take a shower?

70
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Sure.

71
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,120
Stay still.

72
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,080
I'll move.

73
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,679
- Oh no.
- Hey!

74
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,279
Lan, there's a gecko.

75
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,399
- Lan.
- What?

76
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,840
There's a gecko. Get it out of here.

77
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,159
- Then stay still.
- Get it out of here.

78
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,519
- I know. Just get it out of here.
- Come on.

79
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,159
Just get it out of here.
I don't care how.

80
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,080
- Please get it out of here.
- Alright, alright.

81
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,480
- Oh my goodness.
- I can't do it if you don't let go.

82
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
I won't let go. Just find a way.

83
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,960
- Come on, Lan.
- Hey!

84
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,960
Is it gone?

85
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,039
- Calm down.
- Get it out of here.

86
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,039
- Lan!
- Don't get excited.

87
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Focus on the gecko.

88
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,720
- Oh.
- What?

89
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
It disappeared.

90
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,559
What? How?

91
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,399
You have to find and catch it.

92
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,679
Otherwise, it will come after me
and I will die.

93
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,519
Do you hear me?

94
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,240
It's a sin to
ruin people's happiness.

95
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,039
You will be punished.

96
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,759
Do you think I'm scared?

97
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

98
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Hey!

99
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
You have something on your head.

100
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,399
What is it?

101
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
- What is it?
- Don't move.

102
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,240
What is it?

103
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
What is it?

104
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
It's this.

105
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,399
- Where are you going?
- No!

106
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,159
- What?
- No!

107
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,799
No, get it away!

108
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,759
Come here.

109
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,879
No!

110
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,919
No, get it out!

111
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,879
- How do you like that?
- Get it out!

112
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,440
It ran off.

113
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,679
What?

114
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,360
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

115
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,519
Watch this!

116
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
- Lan!
- What? There's nothing.

117
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,519
- Jerk, you scared me.
- Ow.

118
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,720
- Take this.
- Hey, duckling, stop.

119
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,159
Oh no!

120
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,840
Lan, close your eyes.

121
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
- Right, got it.
- Don't look. Close your eyes.

122
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,840
- Both eyes.
- Okay.

123
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,399
Let go of me. Lan, come on.

124
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,919
- Open your eyes when I say so.
- Okay.

125
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,879
It's not like I want to look.

126
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
Lan!

127
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,159
- Oh.
- Move.

128
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,279
Ow!

129
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,599
Cute.

130
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
What?

131
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,759
Hey.

132
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,890
Are you scared that
I will do something?

133
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,079
Nonsense. I'm not scared.

134
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,410
You aren't scared, right?

135
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,079
Then explain this.

136
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,039
Do you think it will keep you safe?

137
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,240
Well, which cheek
should I start with?

138
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,119
It won't keep you safe.

139
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,599
What are you doing?

140
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,720
You said you weren't scared.

141
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,319
I won't do anything to you.

142
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,119
Petch.

143
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,839
Did you come here by yourself?

144
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,599
Yes, I did.

145
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,839
There's a very important guest
at my house.

146
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,319
I don't want the owner of this house
to feel lonely, so I came over.

147
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
Wait, Petch.

148
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,440
The thing is...

149
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,650
I can't contact Lan. I'm worried
So I came here.

150
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,000
Lan is away right now.

151
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,279
But don't worry.
He can handle himself.

152
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,480
I know that but I can't help it.

153
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,170
If you're worried about him,

154
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,960
you can drop by every day.

155
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,599
You're always welcome at this house.

156
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,759
What do you want in return?

157
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,799
I just want to support
my friend's love life.

158
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,279
I want to support you too.

159
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,000
I want Mook to
finally find her own love.

160
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,799
I don't support you two.

161
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,680
This is an adult matter.
A kid should stay out of it.

162
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm not a kid. I'm mature
enough to know what is proper.

163
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,720
Not only do you
try to be the other woman,

164
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,799
but you also try to destroy
the love between two people.

165
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,279
No.

166
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm not destroying anyone's love

167
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,519
because there's no love
in the first place.

168
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,200
Then take a look at this.

169
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,640
Do you see love in this picture?

170
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,119
(Delete)

171
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,079
(Delete)

172
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
There's nothing to see now.

173
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,640
Anything else?

174
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:37,200
Your behavior is immoral.

175
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,359
You don't care about others.
You only care about yourself.

176
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
You're selfish.

177
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,319
Nampetch,

178
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,960
you're crossing the line.

179
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,079
Honestly,
what are you insulting me for?

180
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,279
Your sister, Lan,

181
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,200
Rut, or yourself?

182
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,720
If you're doing it for yourself,
you're just as selfish.

183
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,400
Nampetch, stop.

184
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Come here.

185
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Come here.

186
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:23,200
Nuch is my guest.
You have no right to do that.

187
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,680
If you're still acting immature,
you will not come here again.

188
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Rut.

189
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,359
Have you changed your mind?

190
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
No, I haven't.

191
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Here.

192
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
Are you calmer now?

193
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,720
If you are, you should have
a talk with your father.

194
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,319
I don't want to talk to him now.

195
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,599
If you say so.

196
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,839
Life is unpredictable.
Anything can happen.

197
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,359
If you have a problem,
you should solve it quickly.

198
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,839
You don't know
what tomorrow will bring,

199
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,720
if you will be alive or dead.

200
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,279
Look at me and my dad.

201
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,799
I have tomorrow,

202
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,279
but my dad doesn't.

203
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,680
I have to go to work.
Tell Lan to call me when he's back.

204
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Sure.

205
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,759
- Nuch.
- Lan.

206
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,559
She was worried because she couldn't
contact you, so she came here.

207
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,160
I'm fine. Thanks for your concern.

208
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,680
I'll leave you two alone.

209
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,680
If something is troubling you,
you can talk to me.

210
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,079
If you mean my dad,
I already handled that.

211
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Really?

212
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,200
I have good news for you.

213
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,200
Your company launch video
has over a million views.

214
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,119
With this great feedback,
your company will do well.

215
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,400
I know you can achieve anything
that you set your mind to.

216
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,640
What if I don't succeed?

217
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,400
That day won't come. I'm sure of it.

218
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,440
A reward for being awesome.

219
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,400
I should head to work.
See you later.

220
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,799
What did your dad say

221
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,599
about you resigning?

222
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,160
He was angry
and we fought, as usual.

223
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,559
He wouldn't let me quit.

224
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,720
Did you tell him the reason

225
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,000
why you're resigning?

226
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,039
No.

227
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
You know I can't tell him.

228
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,119
Right.

229
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,440
Are you okay?

230
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Yes.

231
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,480
Where were you last night?

232
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,480
Well?

233
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,799
I went to Mook's house.

234
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,640
Did you go with her?

235
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Yes, I did.

236
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,640
Do you have something
to tell me about her?

237
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,519
No, I don't.

238
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,160
Everything remains the same
between me and her.

239
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,359
That's good to know.
Try to be honest with me.

240
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,880
I want to hear it from you.

241
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,480
Don't let me find out on my own

242
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,039
because it will end differently.

243
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Boss.

244
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,880
I've finished checking the documents
from Lan's company.

245
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,440
Just as you suspected,

246
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,319
millions worth of products
were lost.

247
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,799
Financial statements
were manipulated.

248
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,279
Poom has traced these transactions.

249
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,880
The account holder's name is Rawin.

250
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,960
Don't underestimate this guy.

251
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,839
Rawin is our prime suspect now.

252
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,119
It's the contract.
You left it at my house.

253
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
Thank you.

254
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,240
Did you come to talk to me
about this contract?

255
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Yes, I did.

256
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,839
But I've changed my mind.

257
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,319
I want my son to work for me again.

258
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,039
And if you can do that,

259
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,519
just tell me
what you want in return.

260
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,119
What if I ask you to give your son
a chance to follow his own path?

261
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,480
I want to see him enjoy his life
and do what he loves.

262
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,559
I don't care
if he fails or succeeds.

263
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,920
Just seeing him on his own journey
is good enough.

264
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Mook,

265
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,480
real life isn't pretty.

266
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,759
I know you want to help him.

267
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,480
But I must insist on this.

268
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,200
I want my son to come back.

269
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,799
We can follow our dreams
while doing our duty.

270
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,759
We don't have to make a choice.

271
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,119
I'm not trying to impede him
or ruin his life.

272
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,799
He chose to give it up.

273
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,880
He chose to do only one thing.

274
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,920
And I can't accept that.

275
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,039
Do you understand me?

276
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,599
Does this mean
you will give him a chance?

277
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,599
That's right.

278
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,599
But you have to convince him
to come back and do his duty.

279
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,519
Alright, I will try.

280
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,680
I handled it.

281
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,960
If the auditor finds out,
you will be in trouble.

282
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,159
If this can help you,
then it's worth it.

283
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,119
Don't worry about me.
You can carry on with your plan.

284
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,000
If you need my help, let me know.

285
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,199
No matter how risky it is,

286
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm willing to do it for my friend.

287
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Win.

288
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,239
If Rawin did attack me
to cover up the fraud,

289
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,159
he should have done it
when I started working there.

290
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,039
But this began in Korea.

291
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,329
It could be that email.

292
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,480
Do you think these sales figures are
lower than they are supposed to be?

293
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,519
Right.

294
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,920
You should tell your dad
to take a look at it.

295
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,400
I'll send it to my sister.

296
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,480
If something is wrong,
she should be the one to tell him.

297
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Okay.

298
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,329
Lak.

299
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,809
She might know about the fraud
and doesn't want you to find out.

300
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,039
Not to mention
her position in the company.

301
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,199
If you consider these factors,
the whole thing makes sense.

302
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,519
Impossible.

303
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,960
It's possible and you know it.

304
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,119
Look.

305
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,199
What proof do you have
that my sister is behind everything?

306
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,480
What proof do you have
that your sister didn't do it?

307
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:10,329
Nothing.

308
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,400
Then your sister and Rawin
are the suspects.

309
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,599
It could be someone else.

310
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,840
It could.

311
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,920
If you're afraid of the truth,
you should back away.

312
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,440
Ignore it and let them work it out

313
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,239
while you focus on our company.

314
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,679
Right. I should do that.

315
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,329
But I'm not a coward
who shies away from reality.

316
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,360
Then it's time to change the game.

317
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,960
Your attacker is
keeping a low profile,

318
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,519
figuring out your next move.

319
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,039
If you want to catch him,
you have to lure him out,

320
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,000
vice president.

321
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,440
I have to be a hunter
who acts like prey.

322
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,559
Check where Rawin was
and if he left the country

323
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,809
- while Lan and I were in Korea.
- Got it.

324
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:03,960
If you're still acting immature,
you will not come here again.

325
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,599
Could you show me this side?

326
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,119
Here.

327
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,840
Are you upset that
Boss gave you a scolding?

328
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,079
He just gave me a scolding.
I'm not upset by that.

329
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,480
How is Lan?

330
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,119
He is calmer now.

331
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,920
It worries me that
Lan has a problem with his dad.

332
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,400
I understand him though.
He's doing it for his future.

333
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,239
If it's possible,
I want to help him.

334
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,199
Don't worry.
Lan can take care of himself.

335
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,719
That's good to hear.

336
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,239
Is that all you want to say to me?

337
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,480
There's one more thing.

338
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,039
Well?

339
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,559
Will you and Lan stay together
until the term is over?

340
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,769
I can't give you an answer.
That's in the future.

341
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,809
Why are you asking?

342
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:42,639
I'm worried about you.

343
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,440
If I were to guess,

344
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,039
Dad probably helped you
with your financial situation.

345
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,159
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
agreed to marry him.

346
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,639
If one day being around Lan
makes you feel uncomfortable

347
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,000
and you're afraid to tell Dad,

348
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,840
you can talk to me.

349
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,480
I may be able to help you.

350
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,440
Think of me as your brother.

351
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,809
Thank you for your concern.
But I don't want to bother you.

352
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,360
If that's all,
I'd like to get back to work.

353
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Alright.

354
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:07,679
(Lan)

355
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,519
Do you want to go with this concept?

356
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Mook?

357
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,289
Yes?

358
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:30,809
It's the concept for the new line.
I want you to create a design.

359
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Okay.

360
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,199
Are you okay?

361
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,769
Do you feel unwell?

362
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,920
She is fine.

363
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:01,880
Lan.

364
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,329
Do you have business here?
I heard you quit.

365
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,000
I came to deal with something.

366
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,480
Can I have a moment with
your co-worker?

367
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Sure.

368
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,880
You're a charmer.

369
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,519
Where are you taking me anyway?

370
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,920
- You'll be my witness.
- Witness.

371
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,719
Don't tell me you're going to quit.

372
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:54,329
If I decide to do something,

373
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,199
will you still support me?

374
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,519
If it isn't wrong or illegal
and it makes you happy,

375
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,239
I will be on your side.

376
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:32,400
(Chalantorn, a passionate CEO)

377
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:12,719
What's your business?

378
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,400
I will work here again.

379
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,199
What are you saying?

380
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,079
Yesterday you announced
to everyone that you were resigning.

381
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,079
Now you want to come back.

382
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,360
This is a company, not a playground.

383
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,880
You can't just come and go
whenever you feel like it.

384
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,719
Are you going back on your word?

385
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,760
- You...
- I'm sorry.

386
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,599
What did you say?

387
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,320
I'm sorry for
thinking only about myself.

388
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,960
If it isn't too late,

389
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,840
I'd like to come back
to help you and my sister out.

390
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm serious.

391
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:50,559
Okay.

392
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:55,440
If you can convince the board
to put their trust in you,

393
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,960
you can return to work.

394
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,199
I won't help you.

395
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:03,519
You are responsible for your words.

396
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Alright.

397
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,079
If I can do it,
I want full control of the company.

398
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,280
I want to show them
I got this job because I deserve it.

399
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,199
Alright.

400
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,599
However, you will be
accountable for any consequences.

401
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,480
This emergency meeting

402
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,039
is about Chalantorn's resignation
as vice president.

403
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,400
Alright.

404
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,000
I will let him explain.

405
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Go ahead.

406
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,239
My announcement may have
consequences,

407
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,239
especially for
the company's credibility.

408
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,440
I have reconsidered it

409
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,239
and decided to
continue working here.

410
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,360
Your indecisiveness
affects the company anyway.

411
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,119
You should just resign.

412
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,559
If you don't, your company's
credibility will be affected too.

413
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,960
Don't worry about us.

414
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,159
We can handle this on our own.

415
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,320
I caused this problem,
and I will find a way to solve it

416
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,960
if you give me a chance
to prove that I'm capable.

417
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:00,920
You have your own company.

418
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,360
Time management
may be an issue for you.

419
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,159
He has been managing
his time well so far.

420
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,960
I don't think it will be an issue.

421
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,679
I have a plan for the future.
Please hear me out.

422
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,000
I want to focus on the online market
to promote our products

423
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,840
without relying on other platforms.

424
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,320
This will reduce costs
and boost sales.

425
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,239
We will target new markets
in Asia to improve distribution.

426
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,360
Well, that sounds interesting.

427
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,880
If you can't do it,

428
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,519
will we be able to remove you
from your position?

429
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
Of course.

430
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,000
I will earn your confidence.

431
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,599
Very well.
We will let him continue his work.

432
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:23,280
After that,
we will do an evaluation.

433
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,239
Lak, send me the vice president's
work as soon as possible.

434
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,199
I want to get to work.

435
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,920
Sure. I will handle that.

436
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,320
I hope you can keep your promise,
vice president.

437
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,639
Alright. Thank you, everyone.

438
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
You're dismissed.

439
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,760
I have one more thing to say.

440
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,239
I want all the documents
on your project, Lak.

441
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,639
Rawin and Danai, I want yours too.

442
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,639
Is that all?

443
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Yes.

444
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,639
I'm glad to hear that
you're serious about this.

445
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,719
If you need my help, let me know.

446
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:08,760
Dad, you don't have to worry.

447
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,800
This is just the beginning.

448
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,039
We still have a long way to go.
I can't be too confident.

449
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
Lak!

450
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,280
Lak, stop it.
Get a hold of yourself.

451
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,760
I'm as calm as I can be.

452
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:00,639
You should give me props for
not giving him an earful back there.

453
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,159
If he wants everything back,
he can have it.

454
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
- Let him have it.
- Hey!

455
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:11,280
Listen to me.

456
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,199
If you want everything back,
I will help you.

457
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:16,800
What will you do?

458
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,039
Talk to Dad?
Don't even think about it.

459
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,840
As for Lan, with his arrogance,
I don't think he will listen to you.

460
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,840
I know a way to make you
become the company's number one.

461
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:37,719
If you want it,

462
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,440
I'm willing to do anything for you.

463
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,079
Trust me.

464
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:44,920
I can do it.

465
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:51,480
I want to be number one.

466
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,960
Help me.

467
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,559
Why did you change your mind?

468
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,599
What are you planning to do?

469
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:48,320
I want to give it a try.

470
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,440
You're willing to do
what you don't want to.

471
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,280
Does this have
something to do with your sister?

472
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:13,119
You suspect that
she could be involved

473
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,159
in the incidents.

474
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,920
You knew?

475
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,440
I also know that you refused
the position because of her.

476
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,320
So why the sudden change of plans?

477
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,000
Can I trust you?

478
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,559
Look into my eyes

479
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,480
and make your own decision.

480
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,559
Are you going to
use yourself as bait?

481
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,360
If I don't do that, we won't
know who is behind the whole thing.

482
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,239
This matter is too
important to ignore.

483
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,760
What will you do
if the attacker shows up?

484
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,719
I will catch him.

485
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,119
And what will you do
if you don't catch him?

486
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:27,159
Don't you have another plan?

487
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,679
No, I don't.

488
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:34,800
You only have one life.

489
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:36,960
Don't play around with it
as if you're playing a game.

490
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,199
Just be careful.

491
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,159
If something seems wrong,
tell me, Rut, or Poom.

492
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,199
Don't go it alone.
Do you understand?

493
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,960
You're bossy.
How will telling you help me?

494
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,519
I don't know. But I won't let
anything happen to you.

495
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:15,760
You stay out of it.
I can deal with it on my own.

496
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:20,960
I want to stay out of it
and leave you on your own,

497
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:22,880
but I can't do that.

498
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:34,599
I'm worried about you.

499
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,519
I know about Lan's decision.

500
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,400
It's very risky.

501
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,639
I'm envious of him.

502
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,800
If it were me, would you be worried?

503
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,480
Of course I would.

504
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,360
We're friends after all.

505
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,400
We may be friends now,

506
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,280
but we don't know about the future.

507
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:13,639
Rut.

508
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:27,079
You should be careful too.

509
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,199
Don't forget you're the only one
who saw the attacker.

510
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,079
I'm scared he will come after you.

511
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:43,280
Alright, I will be careful.

512
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Hey!

513
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,480
- What?
- Come on.

514
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
Oh.

515
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,239
Hey.

516
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,119
Lan!

517
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:42,679
Lan and Praomook's
marriage contract.

518
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:47,440
She married for money and her house.

519
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,760
I thought she did it out of love.

520
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,159
Do you think Lan knows about this?

521
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,920
I don't think he knows.
If he did, he'd have thrown a fit.

522
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:03,320
What do you want me
to do about this?

523
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,159
It's up to you.

524
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,119
You could show it to him
and bring him to his senses.

525
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,360
I have someone else in mind though.

526
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:19,199
Who?

527
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,360
Lak.

528
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,360
I assure you.
She will burn the house down.

529
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,559
From now on,
Rut won't see me as a kid anymore.

530
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,840
Lan!

531
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,199
Do you think
the attacker will show up?

532
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:36,920
Soon.

533
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,239
Lan.

534
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:52,760
What happened?

535
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:13,679
What's wrong?

536
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,199
I dreamed about the attacker

537
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,199
and you.

538
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,920
Did I get hurt in your dream?

539
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,719
It's just a dream.
It doesn't mean anything.

540
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,159
Happy birthday to you.

541
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,159
Happy birthday to you.

542
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:26,760
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

543
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,960
Happy birthday to you.

544
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:35,559
- Bang!
- Wow.

545
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:38,199
Happy birthday, my dear.

546
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,639
I wish my daughter
good health and happiness.

547
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,440
You're 18. You're an adult now.

548
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:48,840
Always think before you act.

549
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:51,719
Thank you, Mom.

550
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:57,159
Well, I wish you success
in your career and studies.

551
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,639
And in love.

552
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,199
Come on. Make a wish.

553
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:10,280
I hope I succeed in everything I do.

554
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:18,159
Happy birthday to you.

555
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,920
Bang!

556
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,039
Yay!

557
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,960
Are you waiting for your girl?

558
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,440
No.

559
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,400
I see.

560
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:09,840
Don't wait. She won't come.

561
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,760
Did you forget that
you told her not to come here?

562
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,239
I told you I'm not waiting for her.

563
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,039
Sure.

564
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:25,199
Well.

565
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,960
Who is at the gate?

566
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,480
Boss.

567
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,719
Someone sent you a threat.

568
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,159
I've checked the cameras.

569
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,400
His face is covered.

570
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,960
Shall I go to the police?

571
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:23,569
No.

572
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:26,359
We don't have any leads on him.

573
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,479
He was well prepared.
We won't find his fingerprints.

574
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:41,039
Using myself as bait worked.

575
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,399
Now that I've returned to
the company, he's on the move again.

576
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,479
I can't believe
it's actually what I thought.

577
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:51,439
Don't assume things.

578
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:53,960
We don't have proof
that can identify the attacker.

579
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:59,529
I can't help it.
Everything is abundantly clear.

580
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,960
Lan.

581
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,399
What is it?

582
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:42,079
It's nothing.
I'm just being paranoid.

583
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,079
You're paranoid.

584
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:47,609
Do you think he is nearby?

585
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,800
Forget about it.

586
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:57,279
What will you do if he comes out?

587
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,279
You know the answer.

588
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,000
Don't put your life at risk
because of me.

589
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,359
Think about this.

590
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:10,680
Would you do nothing
if I'm targeted and in danger?

591
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,649
You can't help it.

592
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:21,399
The only way to stop me
is to catch the attacker.

593
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:25,359
I will try to remember
more details about him.

594
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:29,880
Even if I didn't see his face,
I may be able to identify him.

595
01:11:04,119 --> 01:11:05,119
What is it?

596
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,479
I brought you coffee
and your favorite dessert.

597
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,239
You need energy from sugar
and starch while you work.

598
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:23,880
- Poom.
- Hm?

599
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,880
Tell me how to make Rut fall for me.

600
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,880
Poom.

601
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,399
I also brought you my work.

602
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,880
Hand it to me.

603
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,800
(How To Be Romantic)

604
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,239
How to be romantic.

605
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:54,199
It's a catchy title, I promise.

606
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:56,359
You brat.

607
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:00,609
I'm not a kid anymore.

608
01:13:04,529 --> 01:13:05,960
I should get back to work.

609
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,880
Mook is very worried about you.

610
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:50,119
She is either worried
or is stressed.

611
01:13:52,609 --> 01:13:54,479
She has always been with me
when the attacker showed up.

612
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:57,720
If this continues,

613
01:13:58,479 --> 01:13:59,960
it will take a toll on her.

614
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:03,569
If it really takes a toll
on her mental health,

615
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:05,399
what will you do?

616
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,880
What will you do if he comes out?

617
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:18,359
You know the answer.

618
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:20,960
Don't put your life at risk
because of me.

619
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,399
Think about this.

620
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:26,760
Would you do nothing
if I'm targeted and in danger?

621
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,159
What's wrong?

622
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,960
Let's go home.

623
01:15:25,649 --> 01:15:26,960
I'm going to take her home.

624
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,239
If something comes up,
leave it for tomorrow.

625
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,609
- Come on.
- Wait.

626
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:34,479
Let me clean my desk.

627
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,439
You leave work on time,
vice president.

628
01:16:23,569 --> 01:16:25,039
You two seem to get along well now.

629
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,720
Is it you who convinced him
to come back here?

630
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,960
You're mistaken.

631
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:38,800
The person who made me
change my mind is you.

632
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,199
Why?

633
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:41,840
I want to help you.

634
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,079
With work.
I don't want you to work too hard.

635
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:52,119
I don't need help.

636
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:53,649
But I want to.

637
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:57,079
One day you will understand.

638
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,439
Why did you take me to my house?

639
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:44,569
You have to stay away from me.

640
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:46,279
For now you will stay here.

641
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:50,199
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

642
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:53,319
I don't want to be around you.

643
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:55,439
Being around you

644
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,649
makes me miss my chance
to be with Nuch.

645
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:00,529
You make me feel uncomfortable.

646
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:11,680
Do whatever you want then.
If it makes you happy,

647
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,279
I told you I'm willing to
support you in everything.

648
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:44,399
He is so stubborn.
I can tell he is worried about her.

649
01:18:46,569 --> 01:18:47,569
Oak.

650
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,319
Oak, I have urgent news.

651
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:03,000
You don't want her to put her life
at risk, so you sent her home.

652
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,319
That's right. This place isn't safe.

653
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:09,079
The attacker came to our front door.
Something could happen to her.

654
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,479
Staying away from me is best.

655
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:15,840
And she agreed to stay home
even though she's very worried?

656
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:21,920
I guess you hurt her
with your words again.

657
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,880
Like I can convince her
by being nice. She is stubborn.

658
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:30,239
She will listen
if you explain things to her.

659
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,199
Just admit you're worried about her.

660
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,079
Tell her how you feel.

661
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,680
Don't be so stoic.

662
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:43,359
It's already done. What's the point
of bringing it up?

663
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,880
It's to make you think.

664
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,569
What worries me is,

665
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,479
what if he targets her instead,
who will be there to help her?

666
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,920
That won't happen.

667
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:58,569
Anything can happen.

668
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,439
Don't forget that
Mook is our witness.

669
01:20:34,649 --> 01:20:38,000
Nuch, are you free tomorrow?
I want to see you.

670
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,880
Come in.

671
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:22,609
Oh, your complicated relationship
gives me a headache.

672
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:25,840
Not to mention the attacker
and the love triangle.

673
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,479
Now he goes back to Nuch.

674
01:21:28,609 --> 01:21:31,239
And I'm a crazy woman
who worries about him.

675
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:37,159
Who knows, he could be worried
about you and want to keep you safe.

676
01:21:39,529 --> 01:21:41,079
Don't give me hope.

677
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:43,609
It's possible.

678
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:55,649
(I will take care of him.
You can't get him back now.)

679
01:22:00,609 --> 01:22:02,359
He is a man of his word.

680
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,079
Can you tell me
what's troubling you?

681
01:22:36,609 --> 01:22:38,159
Is it about your work?

682
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,319
Yes, it's about my work.

683
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,880
Don't think of other things.

684
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:54,239
Focus on me.

685
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,720
(Lan)

686
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,319
(Praomook)

687
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:02,720
(Praomook)

688
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,199
(Rut)

689
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:32,880
Rut, did you miss me?

690
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:35,880
How is Mook?
She didn't answer her phone.

691
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,560
Nampetch,

692
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,840
I have to speak to your sister.
Can I talk to her?

693
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:45,800
Let me think about it.
