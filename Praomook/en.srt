[Previous episode]

32
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,665
We indeed successfully enter Haishen Island,

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,665
but this is just the beginning.

34
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:16,599
Great!

[Black Level Seven Test]
Is this the difference between

36
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,832
the top-tier and the black tests?

37
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,865
The challenge is about going up the stairs

38
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,932
but we need to pass through
the forbidden area of Haishen Island.

39
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,965
This pressure can bring out our potential.

40
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:29,699
Bai Chen Xiang, please accept the test
of the Ocean Delusion Beast in the Sea Within a Sea.

41
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,132
I am ready.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,332
(Forty-nine, fifty...)

43
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,165
(The recovery of soul power
can't keep up with the consumption.)

44
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,132

[Episode 171]

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,765
Be careful, Brother San!

47
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,932
This is what it feels like to be stuck.

48
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,399
Wu, don't get close to
the Light of the God of the Ocean.

49
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:09,765
You will get hurt!

50
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,565
San is running out of soul power.

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,732
(Within the Light,)

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,732
(the teleporting skill is ineffective)

53
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,265
(and I can only use
the Invincible Golden Shield against attacks.)

54
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,865
(I can't go any further under such pressure.)

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,032
I'm fine.

56
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,499
I need to keep trying to finish this challenge.

57
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,065
You should all have a try.

58
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,165
Okay.

59
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,632
San.

60
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,199
The pressure from the Light
comes from the front entirely.

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,999
We can defend ourselves with soul power.

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,599
But what about Wu?

63
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,399
As long as Wu stays close to me,

64
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,065
I can protect her with my soul power.

65
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,432
But you will use your power even faster.

66
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,699
Wu's body will also be affected by the pressure.

67
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,199
That's why I need to get stronger as fast as I can.

68
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:12,599
Do you have a way?

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,298
Teacher once said

70
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,599
that the bigger the pressure,

71
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,832
the more likely to bring out one's potential.

72
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,265
The best time to improve

73
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,899
is when a soul master's life is in danger.

74
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:28,265
The Light of the God of the Ocean
is the best catalyst for our growth.

75
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,765
(My breathing underwater
can only last for 30 minutes.)

76
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,699
(I need to quickly find
the Ocean Delusion Beast and pass the challenge.)

77
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,032
(A millennium soul beast...)

78
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,965
(Is that the Ocean Delusion Beast?)

79
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,465
(It looks very aggressive.)

80
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,699
(I won't have an advantage
if I attack head-on.)

81
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,165
(I need to remain hidden
and take it down with one shot.)

82
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,399
(Oh no, it saw me!)

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,565
(Made it!)

84
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,965

to pass the challenge.)

85
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,465
(I can't fall behind!)

86
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,832
No... I can't do it anymore...

87
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,699
Thirty steps

88
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,699
is my limit.

89

Rong Rong, are you alright?

90
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,799
My body is too weak.

91
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,532
Even with the amplification
from the Jiubao Amber Pagoda,

92
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,565
I can't enhance the resistance.

93
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,632
Support branch soul masters are at
a big disadvantage against the Light.

94
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,465
Moreover, you have to climb

95
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,899
more stairs than most of us.

96
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,565
One hundred and thirty-six steps...

97
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,965
Don't push yourselves too hard. Safety first.

98
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,332
Can we really finish

99

a challenge like this?

100
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,832
(My cultivation speed
has significantly increased.)

101
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,399
(I no longer feel weak.)

102
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,532
(This is the same state I was in
when I was at the waterfall.)

103
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,865
(The longer we last
under the pressure of the Light,)

104
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,332
(the faster we cultivate.)

105
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:35,965
(But...)

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,932
(If I can't talk to Wu about her health in time,)

107
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:41,899
(she will be easily hurt)

108
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,032
(when we pass through
the Light of the God of the Ocean.)

109

(This time,)

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,665

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,232
Wu, we are already on Haishen Island.

114
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,232
Did you feel the thing
we experienced so far?

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,332
Are you angry?

116
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:24,532
What's wrong?

117
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,065

118
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:35,665

119
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,099

120
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,232

entered the Light.)

121
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:46,465
(Does this mean)

122
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,199
(Wu is more powerful than me?)

123
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,165
Be careful.

124
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,632
Brother Dai stopped at the 38th flight of stairs.

125
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,832
(This is Wu's first attempt
and she didn't use any skills.)

126
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:19,665

than Brother Dai.)

cultivate an unbreakable physique.)

130
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,265
(Wu must have absorbed its effects)

131
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,299
(and greatly increased her endurance
and soul power.)

[Soul Land]

135
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,232
Wu, how are you feeling?

136
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,832
My body is not at my upper limit,

137
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,332
but my soul cannot take it anymore.

138
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,465
If you're just carrying my body,

139
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,365
you don't need to worry about
the first sixty flights of stairs.

140
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,365
I can bear even more.

141

Come back inside of me now.

142
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:22,332
Your soul can't be damaged.

143

147

but not yourself,

148
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,232

Brother, let me come out every day
and cultivate with you from now on.

151
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,799
The pressure on me just now helped exercise
both my body and my soul.

152
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,699
I should be able to hang on for a longer while.

153
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,665
I should go back. Don't forget what I said.

(If Wu can do all that for Brother San,)

156
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:34,699
(then I can't give up either.)

157
