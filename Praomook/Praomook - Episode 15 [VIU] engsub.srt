1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,000
(Praomook)

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,320
So this contract is real.

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,239
Now that you know the truth,
what will you do next?

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,280
I want you to be careful
of your brother-in-law.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,239
I think Nuch and Danai
seem suspiciously close.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
How close do you think they are?

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,119
I don't love Praomook.
Are you happy?

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,960
So far you haven't been
honest with me.

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,039
Go be with whoever you want.
I will take care of her.

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,119
If people knew why you got married,
wouldn't you feel ashamed?

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,479
Let's get a divorce.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Alright.

13
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,159
(Divorce Certificate)

14
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,359
Uncle, I appreciate your kindness.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,319
But I'm firm about my decision.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,359
If it were back then,
I wouldn't accept this.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,640
But you got hurt because of my son,
and I'm not okay with that.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,319
About your house, you can have it.

19
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,040
Think of it as compensation
for the trouble.

20
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,200
It's too much.

21
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,319
I will move out as soon as I can.

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,120
(Divorce Certificate)

23
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,719
Did she get anything?

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,759
She wouldn't accept anything.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,530
Dad's possessions are intact.
Are you happy?

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Very.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,599
I'm glad she's left our family.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,840
I think she became free.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,919
You can think whatever you want.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,960
Just know that
I finally feel at peace.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Oh.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
And if you're thinking about
getting back with your ex,

33
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,800
I suggest you find a new girlfriend.

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,000
Treenuch can only be your ex.

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,479
I don't want her

36
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,719
as my sister-in-law.

37
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,560
Our company is facing trouble.
I want you all to find out together.

38
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,520
There are complaints about
our products not meeting standards.

39
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
That they are unstable,

40
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,080
are made of low-quality materials,
and are overpriced.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
Even worse,

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
our new products
were available on Lan's Much app

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
before their launch.

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,439
I ordered some of them.

45
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,520
They really are our products.

46
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,759
Have you checked how they got out?

47
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,080
I have. They probably got out
during production.

48
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,050
I've also checked
our defective furniture.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,730
The issue occurred during
the material selection process,

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,800
resulting in overpriced,
low-quality products.

51
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,959
The person responsible is

52
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,959
the design and development manager.

53
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,120
All the evidence points to Rawin.

54
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,050
He might be the culprit.

55
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,240
(Reviewer: Rawin Mahadeshoshai)

56
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,759
Now that we have hard evidence,

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,399
we should look into it
and contact the police.

58
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,920
I don't think we should
involve the police yet.

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,519
Let me handle it.

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
However, I will need
full authority on this.

61
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,680
Alright then.
Prepare a report on this for me.

62
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Okay.

63
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,759
Poom, check
the merchant in question on Much.

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
Find out who they are,
where they are located,

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,040
and where they procured
the products.

66
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,639
Got it.

67
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,720
Have you told the police?

68
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,839
Not yet. I asked my dad not to.

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Why?

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,360
If my sister is involved,
I won't be able to help her.

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
What about Mook?

72
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,360
Dad told her to stay at
the condo for now.

73
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,279
Anyway, I'll leave her to you.

74
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Lan, aren't you worried
about her at all?

75
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm doing this because I'm worried.

76
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,079
Right.

77
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,879
Talk to you later.

78
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,959
Lan, you have to suspend Rawin,

79
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,199
or put together a team
to investigate this. I will help.

80
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,439
I will handle it myself.

81
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,000
You can help me with the press.

82
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,600
Alright. But you can't be
lenient about this.

83
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,319
No matter who they are,

84
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,279
if they are dirty,
I won't let them get away.

85
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,519
(Subject: Review of suspension)

86
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,399
(Chalantorn Anantanapat
Vice President)

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,079
Oh, Lan.

88
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,960
You seemed focused today.

89
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,279
But you didn't.

90
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,759
Are you worried about the company?

91
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
I've been watching Rawin
for a while.

92
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,399
Now that we have evidence,
I'm ready to get rid of him.

93
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,159
Like removing a cancerous finger.
Let's worry about the outcome later.

94
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,450
I hope the finger we plan to remove
is actually cancerous.

95
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,240
If it isn't, cancer may spread
to the whole hand.

96
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,240
The evidence points to him.
We have the culprit.

97
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,279
According to what I have found,
Rawin could be a scapegoat.

98
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
What do you mean?

99
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,000
He might have been framed.

100
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,279
The true culprit
could go unpunished.

101
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,450
Who is it?

102
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,840
How do you know that?

103
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
I've known for a while,
but wasn't sure.

104
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,159
Once I have all the evidence,
I will let you know who they are.

105
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,240
When you know,

106
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,279
let me know.

107
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,679
Where are you going?

108
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,399
Out of here.

109
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,440
Let me give you a ride.
For your safety.

110
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Let go.

111
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,519
Even if we're no longer married,

112
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm still worried about you.

113
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,559
Your concern is unwanted.

114
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,360
If you want to take care of Mook,
give me a straight answer.

115
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,480
Do you love her?

116
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,159
Take care of her for me.

117
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,399
You didn't answer my question.

118
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,440
I will take that as a no.

119
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,080
Don't worry.

120
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,480
I will keep her safe.

121
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,399
The evidence points to him.
We have the culprit.

122
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,240
According to what I have found,

123
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Rawin could be a scapegoat.

124
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,159
He might have been framed.

125
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,480
The true culprit
could go unpunished.

126
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
Once I have all the evidence,
I will let you know who they are.

127
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Lan.

128
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,080
Mook and I got a divorce.

129
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,919
Congratulations on your freedom.

130
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,440
You don't look happy.

131
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
Do you regret losing her?

132
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
Don't forget that
she doesn't love you.

133
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,559
She wanted your money.

134
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,759
It's best to stay away
from that selfish woman.

135
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,799
What about you?

136
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,720
Why did you come back into my life?

137
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,039
Why do you ask?

138
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,399
Do you think I'm like her?

139
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,879
You two are different.

140
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm asking you that
because I want to know you

141
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,799
and everything about you.

142
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,200
I came back into your life because
no one else deserves you like I do.

143
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,039
I love you.

144
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,319
Thank you for the ride.

145
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,079
I will find time to visit you.

146
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm still concerned about
your safety.

147
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,599
Alright.

148
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Don't tell Lan where I am.

149
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,319
I want to start over
and forget about what happened.

150
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,359
Okay.

151
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,960
(Poom)

152
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,200
I know. I'll handle it.

153
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,960
I have to go. Excuse me.

154
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,319
I have to go.
That's all I have to say to you.

155
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,039
I will wait for you.
I hope it won't be a waste of time.

156
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,799
Of course.

157
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,799
Get yourself ready.

158
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,759
I will come back later.

159
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,599
If you shoot, I shoot.

160
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,880
Let's see who is faster.

161
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,240
Wait, Rut.

162
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,200
I will handle him.

163
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,519
But...

164
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,640
You know who he is, don't you?

165
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,680
Get yourself ready.

166
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,839
I will come back later.

167
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Good timing.

168
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,039
Take your stuff with you.

169
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,880
From now on we won't talk again,
unless it's about work.

170
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,039
Never come back here.

171
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,079
And return my keycard.

172
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,559
As soon as you found out
they got a divorce,

173
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,920
you get rid of me.

174
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
You know we aren't a thing.

175
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,000
Now that I've found
someone better, richer,

176
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,519
holding the vice president position,
I have to choose him.

177
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,039
Don't compare me to Lan.

178
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,200
You can't compete with him.

179
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,359
Do you think he loves you?

180
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,400
You're just a toy.

181
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,079
When he gets tired of you,

182
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,680
he will leave you.

183
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,119
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

184
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,799
If he knows you slept with me,

185
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,799
he won't want you.

186
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,799
If you tell him, I will tell Lak
she has an unfaithful husband.

187
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,359
If you tell her, I will kill you.

188
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,279
There are no secrets in this world.

189
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,359
Lak.

190
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,720
Lak.

191
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't.

192
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,359
I've seen enough.

193
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,119
Do you take me for a fool?

194
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,160
Snake.

195
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,720
You stabbed me in the back.

196
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,920
You pretend to be high and mighty

197
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,119
when in fact,
you're as dirty as a pig.

198
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,359
Sleeping around with a married man.

199
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,799
You're just a mistress.

200
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,759
- I'm not a mistress.
- Then what are you?

201
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
A man's plaything?

202
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,200
You're cheaper than I thought.

203
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
You!

204
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,720
Stop seeing Danai
and get out of Lan's life

205
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,759
before I deal with you.

206
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,000
A cheap woman like you
doesn't deserve my brother.

207
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,839
I told you before, didn't I?

208
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,480
If you betray me,

209
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,279
I will make you regret it.

210
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,559
If I can make your life comfortable,

211
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,079
I can ruin it too.

212
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,240
Your life is in my hands.

213
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,519
If you hurt my sister,
I will send you to jail.

214
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,319
Lan.

215
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
Do you think

216
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,480
you can do anything to me?

217
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,720
Why don't we find out

218
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,359
what the evidence I have here
can do to you?

219
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,200
Evidence?

220
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,599
What is it about?

221
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,599
It's about the fraud,

222
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,160
showing that
the culprit isn't Rawin,

223
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,079
but Danai.

224
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,359
In this,

225
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,720
there is proof that the documents
and Rawin's signature are fake.

226
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,640
Documents you created to cover up
years of embezzlement

227
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,559
are also in here.

228
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Lak.

229
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,799
Don't believe him. He is lying.

230
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,279
He is trying to get rid of me.

231
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,000
There could be nothing on that.

232
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,240
I knew you would doubt me.

233
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,039
All the evidence against him
is in here.

234
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,960
If you don't believe me,

235
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,960
we can prove it
in front of the police.

236
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,119
Lak, listen to me.

237
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,720
Greedy pig.

238
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,599
I'm going to remind you

239
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,920
that you are here today
because of me and my dad.

240
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,599
Piece of trash.

241
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,119
Right, I'm a piece of trash.

242
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,599
But you made me become this man.

243
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
Don't put the blame on me.

244
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,279
I'm telling you the truth.

245
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,279
You've walked all over me,

246
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,480
telling me I'm worthless,

247
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,880
incapable,

248
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,240
even though I've worked so hard

249
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,759
as if I were a slave.

250
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,359
In the end, I really am a slave.

251
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,400
No one appreciates me.

252
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,799
My life isn't in your hands.

253
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,279
You're always ready to ruin my life.

254
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,880
And I don't know when

255
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,759
you will take everything back.

256
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,839
I never thought about leaving you.

257
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,119
I've done everything for you.

258
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,400
You've done it for yourself.

259
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,240
You put me down.

260
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,599
That's why I had to do something.

261
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,359
I can't lose.

262
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,440
Everything is your fault.

263
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,039
It's in your nature.
My sister has nothing to do with it.

264
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,119
I will make sure you go to jail.

265
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Lan.

266
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,799
Let him go. I'm begging you.

267
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,519
After all of that,
you're still protecting him.

268
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,720
I have to catch him.

269
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,359
Lan.

270
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,200
If this gets to the police,
it will be out of our control.

271
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,480
If it gets on the news,
it will affect the company and Dad.

272
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,920
Are you going to let him get away?
It won't end here.

273
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,720
I will end it myself.

274
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,679
I will take responsibility
for what he did.

275
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,239
I'm the reason why
he became this man.

276
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,639
I put too much pressure on him.

277
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,519
I did it for his own good.

278
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,480
I love him.

279
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:32,599
However,
it's my love for him that hurt him.

280
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,039
Please let me deal with this, Lan.

281
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,519
Alright.

282
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,809
I will let him get away this time.

283
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,559
If something happens after this,
I won't give him another chance.

284
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Lan.

285
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,920
We will talk later.

286
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,559
Okay.

287
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,329
Danai, you ruined everything.

288
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,039
Find Danai and bring him back.

289
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,039
Give him time.
I will deal with this myself.

290
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,960
No. Even though you two are married,
you don't have to take the blame.

291
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,079
If he has to go to jail,

292
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,289
will you go to jail in his place?

293
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,000
I can do it.

294
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,199
Laknara.

295
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,400
If I hadn't put him down

296
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:55,289
or made him think I could leave him
anytime, he wouldn't have done this.

297
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,199
This is partly my fault.

298
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,329
It still doesn't
justify what he did.

299
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,840
Come on, dear.

300
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,559
Let's not send someone to jail.

301
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,199
We should end this discreetly.

302
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,239
If you want a second chance,

303
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,809
find Danai and bring him back.

304
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Lak.

305
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,809
Do as he said.
It's our best solution.

306
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:34,639
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

307
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,960
Please try again later.

308
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,289
You just let a wild animal get away.

309
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,039
You don't know what he will do
once he finds his footing.

310
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,289
Let him try.

311
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,719
Then I will make him pay
once and for all.

312
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,880
That way, I won't break
my promise to my sister.

313
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,199
I know you can look after yourself.

314
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:57,480
But what about Mook?

315
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,519
We can't guess
what his next move will be.

316
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,360
Where did you hide her?

317
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,400
You don't have to know.

318
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,360
Just know that
she is in a safe place.

319
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,639
Then you do your job.

320
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,199
If you fail, I will make you pay.

321
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,840
Who are you to make me pay?

322
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,519
Ex-husband?

323
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,400
Childhood friend?

324
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,440
Both titles

325
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,840
entitle you nothing.

326
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Whatever.

327
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Have you finished packing?

328
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,880
Do you need my help?

329
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,239
It's almost done.

330
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Let's start a new life.

331
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,159
Although this house is smaller,

332
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,329
I'm sure we'll be happier.

333
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,000
No matter what happens,
we will get through it together.

334
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,769
If you want to do something,
you can go ahead.

335
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,769
You should do things
for yourself too.

336
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,039
Alright, Mom.

337
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,809
All the evidence against him
is in here.

338
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,519
If you don't believe me, we can
prove it in front of the police.

339
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,719
Greedy pig.

340
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,960
Did you take me for a fool?

341
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,769
Right, I'm a piece of trash.

342
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,159
But you made me become this man.

343
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,639
- Don't put the blame on me.
- I'm telling you the truth.

344
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,679
You've walked all over me,

345
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:46,519
telling me I'm worthless.

346
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,559
My life is in your hands.

347
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,360
You're always ready to ruin my life.

348
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,159
And I don't know when
you will take everything back.

349
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,360
I'm scared that
I will lose everything.

350
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,440
That's why
I had to look after myself.

351
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,679
I will not struggle again.

352
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,329
Come on.

353
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,679
Let go.

354
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:30,769
You!

355
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,840
You released the video, didn't you?

356
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,519
I asked you a question.

357
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,559
Somebody, help me!

358
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:39,239
Help me!

359
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,119
Nobody will help you.

360
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,679
You snake, you ruined my life.

361
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,159
It's your own doing.

362
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,679
Alright.

363
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,199
Since you ruined my life,

364
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm going to make you
unable to face anyone again.

365
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,079
No, don't.

366
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,769
Lan ordered me to do it.

367
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,289
He said he let you go
to make you think you got away,

368
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,000
then he would make you pay later,

369
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,960
so you would finally
get out of his sister's life.

370
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,289
He wants to destroy me, doesn't he?

371
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,840
I was just following his orders.

372
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,119
I'm sorry.

373
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,039
Alright.

374
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,039
Since he destroyed my life,

375
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,079
I'm going to take him down with me.

376
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:34,079
Tell him

377
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,480
he will suffer with me.

378
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,920
And if I can't hurt him,

379
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:42,159
his loved ones will have to do.

380
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,079
I will start over with you

381
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,880
as a friend.

382
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,719
Even if this didn't happen,
we wouldn't be able to continue.

383
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,800
It's you who believes
we can't continue.

384
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,280
Do you think
I don't know how you feel?

385
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,360
You may be with me,
but your heart is somewhere else.

386
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,480
I know where my heart is.

387
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,119
That's why
I want to be clear with you.

388
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,440
If you don't feel anything for me,
you can leave.

389
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,840
I refuse to be
the only one who loses.

390
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:08,599
I'm sorry, Lan.

391
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,239
Okay, I just secured your bookings

392
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,800
for this week and
the beginning of next month.

393
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,840
Okay, thank you.

394
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:29,960
Hey, Mook.

395
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,400
You just got more gigs.

396
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,360
You're booked up for three months.

397
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
That's good.

398
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,119
You're lucky in game
and unlucky in love.

399
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,199
You can have a good life
without a man.

400
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,239
I guess so.

401
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,199
Did they go to Chiang Rai?

402
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,280
Yes, Mook, Oak,
and Petch went there.

403
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,159
Don't they realize it's dangerous?

404
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,320
Dangerous? How?

405
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,239
It's nothing.

406
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,960
Nampetch.

407
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,639
Wait here. I will be back.

408
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:28,239
Rut.

409
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,320
Why didn't you tell me
you came here?

410
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,199
Let's talk about that later.
I'm worried about my sister.

411
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,920
She just left all of the sudden.

412
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Lan.

413
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,360
- Mook!
- Lan!

414
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:45,079
Rut, catch him.

415
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,079
Somebody, get a doctor!

416
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,559
Lan,

417
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,920
are you okay?

418
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,880
I'm okay.

419
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,880
Please wait outside.

420
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:25,360
Please move aside.
Let us take a look at her.

421
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,800
How is she?

422
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:34,639
The patient is safe.

423
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,679
Mook, how are you?

424
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:00,639
Does it hurt?

425
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,519
A little.

426
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:07,199
I will be fine though. Don't worry.

427
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,920
Oh, my poor girl.

428
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,119
You're safe now.

429
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Okay.

430
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,239
Mook.

431
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,800
I'm sorry that my family
dragged you into trouble.

432
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,039
Also, thank you for saving my son.

433
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,159
Without you,

434
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,079
he would have died.

435
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,119
About Danai, I will handle it
as soon as possible.

436
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,159
Alright.

437
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:16,119
Lak, help me.

438
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,320
Take it easy.

439
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,599
That's for hurting my brother.

440
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,920
And that's for betraying me.

441
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,039
You said I put pressure on you,
forcing you to steal money.

442
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,239
I admit that
I played a part in this.

443
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,280
But my mistake is
marrying a piece of trash like you.

444
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:44,159
Lak.

445
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,960
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

446
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,079
Don't.

447
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,119
Don't give me stupid excuses.

448
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:56,360
You planned the whole thing.
This isn't your first time.

449
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,480
Lan told me everything.

450
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,199
Lan.

451
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,599
If only you could stop being nosey
and leave me be.

452
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,519
You messed with my life.

453
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:18,280
You took the position
that was supposed to be mine.

454
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,320
You're such a greedy pig.

455
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,679
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Lak, that's enough.

456
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:24,639
Listen to me.

457
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,719
Even if Lan didn't come back,

458
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,840
I wouldn't let you be in charge.

459
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,239
Did you think
you're smarter than everyone?

460
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,960
Did you think you could
get away with everything?

461
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:39,760
We just gave you a chance
to redeem yourself.

462
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:42,800
I'm disappointed

463
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,079
in how stupid you are.

464
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,320
Right, I'm stupid.

465
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,239
I'm stupid for working so hard,

466
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:58,679
hoping that somebody
would appreciate me

467
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:00,920
and give me a chance.

468
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:06,199
Win.

469
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,079
You want to be the president's
son-in-law, don't you?

470
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,960
Go ahead. You can have the title.

471
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,440
- Hey!
- Don't do it.

472
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,760
Did I hit the nail on the head?

473
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,039
If you don't shut your mouth,
no one here will help you.

474
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,039
This is your fault, Lan.

475
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,599
You ordered Treenuch
to release the video.

476
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,079
- I didn't do it.
- I don't believe you.

477
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,920
She confessed
that you told her to do it.

478
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,760
Everything

479
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,159
was going nicely.

480
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,599
When I get out,

481
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,119
I'm going to kill you first.

482
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,760
Hey, stop!

483
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,679
Go over there. Move.

484
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,360
Come here.

485
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:03,599
Move.

486
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,840
Rawin,

487
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:25,239
after you're done here,
you can go back to Bangkok.

488
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,519
Also, you're free to take leave
if you want to.

489
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,039
I want to get back to work quickly.
There are many things to be fixed.

490
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:38,199
Good. I'll leave it to you.

491
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,920
Of course, sir.

492
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:49,719
Lak.

493
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,960
Dad.

494
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,280
You knew that
Danai is untrustworthy, didn't you?

495
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,880
I want you to find out

496
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,119
who attacked Lan.

497
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Do you suspect someone?

498
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,360
I don't trust Danai.

499
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,719
But I'm unsure if he is connected.

500
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,199
If something seems suspicious,
let me know immediately.

501
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,159
Yes, sir.

502
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:26,679
Yes, I did.

503
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,920
I thought he would repent.

504
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:34,639
And I was wrong.

505
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,440
You and Lan

506
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,360
don't trust me.

507
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:47,519
You thought I was also involved.

508
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:59,239
I wasn't sure, so I investigated.

509
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,119
If you were involved,

510
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,239
I would try to make it
less hard on you.

511
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:11,679
I may love Danai,

512
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:14,679
but I love my family more.

513
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,960
I wouldn't let
anyone hurt my family.

514
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,400
Dad.

515
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm sorry for marrying an evil man

516
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,400
and causing you trouble.

517
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,480
No, Lak.

518
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,920
It isn't your fault.

519
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,360
Don't blame yourself.

520
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,360
Listen to me, Lak.

521
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,679
I'm very proud of you.

522
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,320
Do you know that?

523
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:51,480
Hi.

524
00:59:56,199 --> 00:59:59,159
I'm sorry that Danai hurt you.

525
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,199
It isn't your fault.
You don't have to apologize.

526
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,760
I'm not ready to be
completely nice to you.

527
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:23,480
But I understand

528
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,719
how it feels when
you want to save your loved ones.

529
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,920
That's all I want to say.

530
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,960
Thank you, Lak.

531
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:30,599
Don't think I will always
let you hurt me.

532
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,239
If you slap me again,

533
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,599
I'm going to press charges and
you'll be in jail with your husband.

534
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,880
That was nothing compared to
what you did.

535
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:41,440
You ruined Danai's life.

536
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,440
You caused my company trouble.

537
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,039
But your useless husband
hurt me first.

538
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:48,039
He lied and said he loved me.

539
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,920
My life went downhill
the moment he came into my life.

540
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,239
I know you don't want me
to be your sister-in-law.

541
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,880
You used me,
just like your husband did.

542
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:00,679
I should have made you suffer more.

543
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:03,599
He blamed you,
saying it wasn't his fault

544
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,719
because he is selfish.

545
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,239
Getting rid of him
is the best thing for both of us.

546
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,639
Removing you from my brother's
life is also the best thing.

547
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,679
You don't deserve Lan.

548
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,199
If you truly love him, you wouldn't
have released that video.

549
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,400
You're free to do whatever you want.

550
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:41,679
But if she comes after our family,

551
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,880
I won't let her get away with it.

552
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,000
Just yell at me
and get it over with.

553
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,760
I'm sorry.

554
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,199
We can't go back to
what we were, can we?

555
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,039
We can't.

556
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,880
Smells nice.

557
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,199
- It's a new recipe.
- Hm?

558
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,400
- I'm trying out a new recipe.
- Oh.

559
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,320
Hm.

560
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,360
Well.

561
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,039
Go on, say it.

562
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,639
I'm tired of waiting.

563
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,400
I want to talk to you about work.

564
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:03,159
You can quit and
do your own thing if you want to.

565
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,400
You can even submit
your resignation letter tomorrow.

566
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Aren't you going to try to stop me?

567
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,280
No, I've had enough.

568
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:14,559
I already have Lak.
I don't know why I would need you.

569
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:21,400
I heard your company
needs a marketing manager.

570
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:26,079
Well, I could let
our assistant manager be in charge.

571
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,159
Come on, Dad.

572
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,960
Well, what do you want to say?

573
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:34,199
I want to be the marketing manager.

574
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:36,280
I have a degree in this field.
I can do it.

575
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,960
Well, what about your company?

576
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,519
I can work two jobs.

577
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:43,480
People can have more than one job.

578
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,599
If your company fails,
I will still have my own company.

579
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:50,480
Hey, don't jinx my business.

580
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:51,920
Dear, did you hear what he said?

581
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,360
Should I disown him?

582
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:55,960
Can you kick him out?

583
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:01,039
Alright, be honest with me.

584
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,360
What made you decide to work for me?

585
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,119
After trying both at the same time,
I realized I can do it.

586
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,039
Also,

587
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,679
Mook told me I still have
a chance to work for you,

588
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,519
while she doesn't have that.

589
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,480
Wow, this son of mine.

590
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,239
I kept telling you that, and
it went completely over your head.

591
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:31,840
But when Mook said it,
you understood.

592
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,920
Alright, if you say so.

593
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,559
I'm warning you though. If you don't
do well, you'll be fired.

594
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,400
And if I do well,
you have to give me a bonus.

595
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,079
It's a deal.

596
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,840
Yes, let's go.

597
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:58,840
Oh, I love you.

598
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,360
Love you.

599
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,039
How is Mook?

600
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,800
Wound is healing. No complications.
She can leave the hospital.

601
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:05,679
Thanks for looking after her.

602
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,559
As someone who loves her,
I'm entitled to say it.

603
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,199
Aren't you worried
that I will be mad at you?

604
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,439
No.

605
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,720
I've handled everything. I can
tell you how I feel about her now.

606
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,199
Don't you think it's too late, huh?

607
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,760
I've given you many opportunities.

608
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,159
You said you didn't feel
anything for her.

609
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,319
And now you're saying you love her?

610
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,159
What are you playing at?

611
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,960
I'm being serious.
I want to be clear with you.

612
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,569
And if you're upset by that,
I'm sorry.

613
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:46,680
We've never fought
over a girl before.

614
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,529
Can't you just leave her alone?

615
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,479
I will stop when Mook tells me to.

616
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,609
We agreed not to
go for the same girl.

617
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:00,199
You have to stop this,

618
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,800
otherwise,
our friendship will be in trouble.

619
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:36,649
Hey.

620
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:40,119
Lan.

621
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:43,399
Ting, why did you let him in?

622
01:09:44,199 --> 01:09:46,680
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

623
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,399
If you did,
I wouldn't have let him in.

624
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:53,649
This time, just give him a pass.

625
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,359
Make it up to her quickly.
I will leave you two alone.

626
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:15,399
Say what you have to say.

627
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:19,649
I made my decision.

628
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:22,960
I will make you love me again.

629
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,439
Lan, it's enough.

630
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,319
I've moved on. Please leave.

631
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,439
Your lips say one thing,
but your heart says another.

632
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,920
You can't move on from me, duckling.

633
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,680
You're right. I haven't moved on.

634
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,239
But if you keep making me
feel like a loser,

635
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,439
one day I might be
able to stop loving you.

636
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:39,239
Lan, let go.

637
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,569
Calm down, Mook.

638
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,800
You never lost.

639
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:47,239
Your love always wins.

640
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,359
It overcame death.

641
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,529
If it wasn't for you,
I would have been dead.

642
01:11:58,279 --> 01:11:59,760
I came here because I love you.

643
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,119
I won't accept your love easily.

644
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,880
Alright.

645
01:12:27,529 --> 01:12:29,239
I will ask you again.

646
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:31,760
Do you love her?

647
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:37,569
Yes, I do.

648
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:45,039
Then you don't have to worry.

649
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,609
We aren't interested
in the same girl.

650
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:50,479
What?

651
01:12:53,529 --> 01:12:57,319
I don't love her the way you do.
She is a friend.

652
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:02,649
Then why did you punch me?

653
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,119
I did it for Mook.

654
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,399
You were horrible to her.

655
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,529
How many times did you make her cry?
I had to teach you a lesson.

656
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,760
Look.

657
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:14,529
If you want her to love you again,

658
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,760
you have to put in your best effort.

659
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:20,649
Jerk.

660
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,039
Yay!

661
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,529
Good job, Petch.

662
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:46,760
Congratulations on
the launch of your game.

663
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:48,399
You did it, Nampetch.

664
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,079
Good job.

665
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:27,649
Thank you.

666
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,359
You convinced me you're capable,
that you're not just playing around.

667
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:34,569
My sister is the best.

668
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,960
Thank you.

669
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,199
Do you think I can get myself
a man after finishing the game?

670
01:14:41,529 --> 01:14:45,119
Oh, if I get a guy in real life.

671
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,079
The creator can't even
get herself a guy.

672
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,399
Petch, who are you trying to get?

673
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,609
I mean, a character in the game.

674
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,119
- Right.
- Right.

675
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,569
Right, Mook.
Can you do the music festival gig?

676
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,569
If you can't,
I can cancel it for you.

677
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
I can do it.

678
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:18,479
Can I go with you?

679
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:57,279
Can you keep Rut away?

680
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:00,359
If you can do it,
I will help you get him.

681
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,760
Follow me.

682
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,399
What are you doing?

683
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,840
Move.

684
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,439
Where are you taking me?

685
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:13,119
Hey! What are you doing?

686
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:19,399
Stay still
if you don't want to fall down.

687
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,760
Why are we here? What do you want?

688
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,649
I want to know
how you feel about me.

689
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:03,569
I don't want to talk about that.

690
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,359
But I want to hear it.

691
01:18:11,239 --> 01:18:12,359
Don't lie.

692
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:14,920
Tell me how you feel.

693
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,039
I can take it.

694
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,800
If I say I don't love you,

695
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,920
what will you do?

696
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,720
I will disappear from your life.

697
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,840
Forever.

698
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,720
I love you, jerk.

699
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,760
I love you so much that I want to
make you lose and love me back.

700
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,239
But I realized that
winning is useless.

701
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,920
You can't win love.

702
01:19:24,649 --> 01:19:25,880
Are you happy?

703
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,880
We were married against our will.

704
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,000
This time we're both willing.

705
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:41,569
More importantly, you love me,

706
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:44,079
and I love you.

707
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,649
We love each other.

708
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,279
Duckling,

709
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:55,800
will you marry me?

710
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
Hey!

711
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,399
What's gotten into you?

712
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,279
I'm really not dreaming.

713
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:41,800
Now, will you marry me?

714
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,760
If it's a yes, give me your hand.

715
01:21:57,439 --> 01:21:58,569
There you are.

716
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:07,319
Now that you're wearing
the ring I chose,

717
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:10,359
I will consider today
our wedding day.

718
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:18,649
Our first of many anniversaries
will be on this day.

719
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,279
Today is the day we love each other,
and no one else gets a say in it.

720
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:28,720
I want you to know

721
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:34,569
that I love you.

722
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,880
I know.

723
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,399
And I will remember
that we love each other.

724
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,569
Chalantorn,

725
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:55,159
I love you.

726
01:22:56,279 --> 01:23:00,319
I know you love me back.
Will you be my boyfriend?

727
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:16,279
Praomook,

728
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,649
I love you too.

729
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:29,680
Hold on.

730
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:31,680
Where are you taking me?

731
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:33,680
I'm going to see your sister.

732
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:35,359
You can't.

733
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,960
Why not?

734
01:25:38,569 --> 01:25:41,569
- Because...
- Because?

735
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,279
Because Mook is busy.

736
01:25:44,649 --> 01:25:46,279
And you have to come with me.

737
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,960
To do what?

738
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,960
To...

739
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:55,039
To watch the balloons over there.

740
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,000
Rut.

741
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,760
Can I take my sister's place?

742
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,800
No, you can't.

743
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:38,609
It's because
I'm still a kid, isn't it?

744
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,239
I'm eighteen now.
I will be twenty in two years.

745
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:43,359
Then you will be twenty-six
or twenty-seven.

746
01:26:43,609 --> 01:26:45,840
It isn't a big gap.

747
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,079
Can you see me as a woman?

748
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:53,479
I will show you that I...

749
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:57,399
- I love...
- I said no

750
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,720
because you aren't
a substitute for anyone.

751
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:03,039
You're you, not your sister.

752
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,199
Everyone has their own worth.
Don't compare yourself to others.

753
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,159
Besides, I know you love me.

754
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:15,649
You know but you don't care.

755
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:18,760
I know and I care.

756
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:23,439
I just realized that
the person I like

757
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,479
is the little sister,
not the big sister.

758
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,960
What?

759
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,000
What did you say?

760
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,840
Do you like me?

761
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,760
I won't repeat myself.

762
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,279
Okay. You like me.

763
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:47,600
And?

764
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,520
I kept telling myself
that you were a kid.

765
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,439
But it was an excuse for me
because I refused to face the truth

766
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,479
that I have fallen you
for who knows how long.

767
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,279
Now I can only wait.

768
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,479
Wait for what?

769
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,159
Wait for the girl to grow up
and be sure about her feelings.

770
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,239
That way,
I won't get my heart broken.

771
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,239
I won't break your heart, trust me.

772
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,920
We'll see about that
after you turn twenty.

773
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:30,680
I don't want to break
a girl's heart.

774
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,319
I wonder whose heart
will break first.

775
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,560
Watch out.

776
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:45,399
I will make your feel sorry.

777
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:47,920
I doubt it.

778
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,760
Hey, Rut!

779
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,880
If you don't stop flirting with me,
I will knock some sense into you.

780
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:01,319
This is just the beginning.

781
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:03,920
Brace yourself.

782
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,359
My love is reciprocated.
Thanks, Lan.
