I still haven't approved
your relationship.

that makes me approve,

185
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,000
then I'll call her your So-bin.

Fine, she can be yours.

Well,

it's only because I'm a curious person.

254

Not because I like you.

255
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,910
Let me be clear with that.

256
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,010
Why bother?
I'm good with it not being clear.

257
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,000

will give you constipation.

for crying out loud.

when not to cross the line.

534
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,900
Guys, let's just drink.

535
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,730
Cheers.

536
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,430
Hello.

537
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,050
I'm sorry. I'll take care of their bill
and take them home.

538
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,070
Why would you pay for their drinks?

539
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,580
Sorry?

540
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,750
I'll wake them up and deal with it.
Just go home.

541
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,370
Aren't you Yeo Jun in first year?

542
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,190
Yes, do you go to my school?

543
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,570
I'm Wang Young-ran, a senior in PE major.

544
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,530
Are you and Soo-hyun close?

545
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,250
No, we're not close.

546
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,040
I want to befriend him, but it's hard.

547
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,130
I just wanted to ask
if you've talked to him.

548
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,950
Soo-hyun and I are friends,
but I can't get hold of him.

549
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,100
You're Soo-hyun's friend?

550
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,520
What did you do to become his friend?

551
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,990
He wants to cut me off
whenever I try to do anything.

552
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,020
He's a difficult one.

553
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,060
But if I don't do anything,
he'll never even glance at me.

554
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,130
Right?

555
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,560
If I were asked to write just one line
on my resume,

556
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,550
I'd write "Nam Soo-hyun's only friend."
Nothing else.

557
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,030
That was an overshare, wasn't it?

558
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,190
Then I'll be "Nam Soo-hyun's friend
whom he adores like his little brother."

559
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,210
That's what I'll be.

560
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,660
Hey, come on.

561
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,600
Hey, let's go for another drink.

562
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,900
Today's the only day I'm available.

563
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,970
You always say you're not available.

564
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,830
-Are you a politician or something?
-Politics sure is important.

565
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,530
Professor Song will have my back soon.

566
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,780
What? Why?

567
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,690
-And you've got my back.
-That's right.

568
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,630
-You little...
-You too.

569
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,860
[Nam Soo-hyun]

570
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,960
-Come on.
-Do you want me to have your back too?

571
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,210
Oh, did you dial my number by mistake?

572
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,980
-Let's go.
-Did I call him?

573
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,130
[Do you want to have dinner?]

574
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,950
Sorry? What?

575
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,820
[Do you want to have dinner?]

576
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,840
[I'm curious.]

577
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,750
[Do you really hate me that much?]

578
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,870
[Yes. Don't follow me.]

579
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,200
[I don't have time to waste with you.]

580
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,970
-Can I call you again?
-No, don't.

581
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,820
[You might call me first, you know.]

582
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,710
[That won't ever happen.]

583
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,670
It's for the coffee. Bye.

584
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,360
[I want to cross the line.]

585
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,960
I'm not curious about you at all.

586
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,740
[So don't be curious about me.]

587
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,770
[Do I]

588
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,370
[have the right
to be curious about someone?]

589
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,290
-What is this?
-I already paid for it. Eat up.

590
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,020
So, you were asking
if I wanted to have dinner alone,

591
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,830
not with you?

592
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,190
Excuse me.

593
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,460
Yes, do you need something?

594
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,630
How am I supposed to eat this?
Look, there's a bug here.

595
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,060
I'm sorry. I'll let the chef know
and get you a new one...

596
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,180
And I asked for butter earlier.
When will I get it?

597
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,650
I'm sorry. I'll bring it right out.

598
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,510
Come here.

599
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,450
What did you do wrong?

600
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,050
Oh, he asked for butter earlier.

601
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,650
Then you should've taken care of it
right away.

602
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,190
-I'm sorry.
-Do you want to get fired?

603
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,520
No, I'll be careful and work harder.

604
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,450
This is your final warning.
I'll be watching you.

605
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,070
I'm sorry.

606
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,450
And why are you always late?

607
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,960
-You need to get here on time.
-I'm sorry.

608
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,320
Gosh.

609
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,930
Did I keep you waiting long?

610
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,150
Don't come close. I smell like food.

611
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,320
Why did you call me here?

612
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,030
I think I know why,
but I want to make sure.

613
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,290
How was the food? Did you like it?

614
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,780
Don't act all sweet.

615
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,720
Why did you call me here?

616
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,660
So I could buy you dinner, okay?

617
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,740
Did you want to make me understand
why you're such a jerk to me?

618
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,930
Whenever I open my wallet,
I'm reminded of yours.

619
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,450
When I see your place, I think of mine.

620
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,900
I feel like I could walk out of my job
and go for drinks

621
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,800
or just chill at a cafe somewhere.

622
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,070
I think to myself, "It seems so easy.
Why can't I do that?"

623
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,340
You see,

624
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,340
I'm fine with not being able
to do stuff like that.

625
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,660
But I think of my brother
whenever I see you, and it hurts me.

626
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,930
You could've kept it short.

627
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,450
You're basically saying
you can't stand seeing me around.

628
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,960
"Don't be curious about me
or try to befriend me."

629
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,470
Did you call me here so I'd just get lost?

630
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,050
Yes, so you'd see my situation
and come to your senses.

631
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,950
I had no idea. I was all excited
on my way here, like an idiot.

632
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,680
Why not pick a better place
if you wanted me to experience

633
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,040
what it's like to be poor?

634
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,850
This place is too boring.

635
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,070
Did you have to work this hard

636
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,050
to pay me back?

637
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,550
I gave up my place.

638
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,360
Oh, you did?

639
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,210
Just to pay me back?

640
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,120
So I'd leave you alone and get lost?

641
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,480
Here, this is what I make in a day.

642
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,390
It's less than how much your dinner costs.

643
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,220
So what?

644
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,550
When I pestered my dad in tears
to buy me a game console

645
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,880
and asked him why my family was so poor,

646
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,880
he didn't say anything.

647
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,440
Then he quietly showed me
how much our total debt was,

648
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,850
his salary, our living expenses,

649
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,410
and the cost of raising me.

650
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,680
He thought that was a faster way
to make me understand.

651
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,920
You and I

652
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,980
can't be friends.
There's no need for us to be friends.

653
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,040
I heard you loud and clear.

654
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,990
You always mean what you say.

655
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:26,980
I prefer this rather than
being left with hope.

656
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,100

Good luck, you two.

661
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,050
Hey, Jun.

662
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,610
I'll join you. Where else would I go?

663
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,770
I knew you'd join us!

664
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,140
Don't tell me you were torn.

665
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,420
That hurts my feelings.

666
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,150
I almost doubted you
and thought you were ditching us.

667
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,390
Let's go.

00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,540

-Gosh, you...
-My mom's there now.

-She can join us.
-Yes, let's go to your place.

What happened to his backer?

674
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,910
Let's go there and...

675
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,060
Hey.

676
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,750
What we did at the convenience store
is enough.

677

Let's not do the same thing again.
It's too childish.

678
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,470
Jun, let's do the assignment
at your place.

679
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,160
-Great idea, for a change.
-Right?

681
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,130
-Yes.
-Let's do the assignment at your place.

682

My mother is supposed to come by that day.

683
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,630
Your mother?

684
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,880
This is my first time hearing you
talk about your mom.

685
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,010
Did we mention what day it'd be?

686
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,190
-I'm hungry.
-Let's go have some tteokbokki.

687
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,650
You know I don't eat tteokbokki.

688
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,190
[-I'm safe here.]
-I love tteokbokki.

689
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,200
Actually, I like it too.

690
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,440
[-No one's curious about me,]
-I can eat it all day.

691
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,630
Do you want to join us?

692
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,260
[and I'm not curious about them.]

693
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,410
-The tteokbokki place over there is good.
-No, thanks.

Hey, you talk to her.

696
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,640
[-And no joy.]
-Let's go.

697
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,270
You're allergic to rice cakes.

698
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,350
[-I'm safe here.]
-I'll take my allergy meds.

Can I ask you something?

702
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,400
You probably know the answer.

703
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:50,160
I want to ask someone about something

704
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,020
but can't muster up the courage.

705
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,090
Will you gain something
by asking this question?

706
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,230
Think about that first.

707
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,460
I know I can't get the truth
just by asking,

708
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,360
but it'll at least make
the other person think.

709
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,890
And they'll either choose to
tell the truth, lie or stay silent.

711

is lying to you

won't it be better than doing nothing?

What do you want to know?

714
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,090
I want to know

why I was fired.

716
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,470
You got fired for a reason.

717

718

I don't want to hate myself.

Even if I do,

720
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,290
I want to know which part
I have to hate and fix.

that's all I saw.

726
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,750
Then that'll be a huge stress for you too.

727
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,480
All I'm going to do is point out
how incompetent you are.

-I'm sorry if I was rude.
