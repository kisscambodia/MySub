[He never said anything]

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,370
[and didn't come by the office.]

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,170
Darn you, Yeo Jun.

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,690
Yeo Jun!

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,830
I treated you like my senior
because I pitied you,

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,380
but you disgust me.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,340
That's better.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,340
It was hard seeing you act so pretentious.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,610
Is that so?

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,380
I put on an act knowing you'd like it.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,650

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,270
Maybe... I'll catch you some other time.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,550
No, don't go.

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,140
Are you here to see me?

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,730
Yes, I am!

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,360
To pick a fight?

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,560
Or maybe you just missed me.

21
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,110
Yeo Jun, do I seem like a pushover to you?

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,390
Yes.

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,530
Even though I do,
you should still keep your promise.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,210
Don't mess with people.

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,050
Especially those desperate--

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,729
I never messed with you.

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,360
I checked at the office.

28
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,830
You should've just said
you didn't want to give up the position.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,550
As if that's too hard to say.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,810
It is for me.

31
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,580
I don't want you to hate me.

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,979
But I only forgot about our agreement.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,370
I got sidetracked on my way to the office.

34
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,590
Don't worry though. I'll keep my word.

35
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,169
-When?
-When I have the time.

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,160
And when exactly would that be?

37
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm wired with a rebellious tendency.

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,550
I tend to act out when people annoy me.

39
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,060
So what are you saying?

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,600
That you should stop worrying

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,370
and be patient.

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,900
So that I'll be happy to help you out.

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,170
Be patient until then.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,140
-You're such a--
-A jerk, right?

45
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,620
Yes, you're an obnoxious pig.

46
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,860
I see her in you.

47
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,310

48
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,890
Where are you headed?

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,410
To my dorm room.

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,250
Do you have an umbrella?

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,450
-No.
-I do, so let me walk you.

52
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,350
No, I'm good.

53
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,110
I need to stop by the office too.

54
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,700
Are you sure you're okay
with giving up this position?

55
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,720
Yes, I already agreed.

56
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,579
Nicely done, So-bin.

57
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,120
How did you persuade him?

58
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,200
I didn't--

59
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,060
I'll have other opportunities,
so of course, I should pull out.

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,090
My gosh, Jun.

61
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,990
How can you be this handsome
and super generous?

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,030
Can you put in a good word
to Professor Song for me?

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,960
Don't worry.

64
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,730
I won't go back on my promise
after what you did.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,170
Also, your switch of class was authorized.

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,250
But brace yourselves.
Professor Park makes you work hard.

67
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,280
Do you take his class too?

68
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,050
You too?
Why though when you're a freshman?

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,649
I'm ambitious, you see.

70
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,290
This is great though.
I'll now see you every week.

Your shoulder's getting wet.
Get inside the umbrella more.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,030
It's like a scene from a movie.

73

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,760
Yes, "Bungee Jumping of Their Own".

something nice today?

Yes,

188
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,160
Are you aware that I had my eyes
set on another student?

189
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,510
Yes.

190
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,100
Have you ever took any one of my classes?

191
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,230
Yes, from introductory classes
to your advanced ones.

192
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,250
But I don't recognize you.

193
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,900
I should since you're a junior.

194

I forgot to mention this

What about those
with no friends in this class?

Sometimes, life boils down
to the connections you have.

of forcing yourself to team up

with other students
who share the same goal

321
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,160
will become an asset.

322
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,710
But Professor, I'm a freshman.

323
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,820
-Isn't this class for juniors?
-It is.

324
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,380
Which is why I should be teamed up
with someone who gets good grades.

325
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,930
He must be referring to you, Soo-hyun.

326
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,530
He's your responsibility now.

327
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,290
-Professor, that's--
-Professor!

328
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,460
I'll lead Jun to a good grade.

329
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,550
You, Han Jung-ho?

330
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,270
I'm old enough to know what I'm doing.

331
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,460
Soo-hyun, you now have
another member on your team.

332
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,010
Who else? Raise your hand
if you need help getting into a group.

333
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,110
Right here and right now,
I'll play matchmaker for you.

Hey, Nam Soo-hyun.

336
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,030
What was with that scowl?

337
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,960
We may both be juniors,
but I'm a year older than you.

338
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,470
So what was with that scowl?

339
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,810
Not again. Why you--

340
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,670
Jung-ho, please.
We're on the same team now.

341
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,570
How can I possibly work with that jerk?

342
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,470
You have me, remember?

343
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,870
Right. Just take your cues
from me and Chun-guk,

344
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,360
and run errands.

345
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,980
Hye-ji, just follow my lead.

346
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,010
Sure thing.

347
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,850
Does that make me the only girl?

348
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,480
We're short a person.

349
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,110
And with Jun being a freshman...

350
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,270
Just a second.

351
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,280
-Me?
-Are you already in a team?

352
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,860
-Not yet.
-How about you join ours?

353
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,180
Well...

354
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,900
I need someone I can trust on the team.

355
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,300
Are you saying you can't trust us?

356
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,800
Someone who works hard.

357
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,860
That jerk...

358
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,010
I wouldn't mind having you on our team.

359
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,290
If this is about the team project
we did last semester, I'm good.

360
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,710
Did something happen between those two?

361
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,780
I don't get swayed by frivolous things.

362
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,290
I checked the file you sent

363
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,020
and liked your work
which is why I'm asking.

364
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,040
Please think about it.

365
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,420
What's there to think about? Just join us.

366
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,010
-What?
-Let's go.

367
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,170
Our first meeting should be held
somewhere fancy.

368
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,320
Let's go.

369
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,170
Off you go.

370
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,550
Really?

371
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,190
Hey, stop that.

372
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,100
-Unbelievable.
-It wasn't me though.

373
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,620
Come on, guys.

374
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,280
Are you deliberately falling behind
or do you just walk slowly?

375
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,520
You startled me.

376
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,800
I always seem to do that.

377
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,440
I'll notify you in advance
before approaching you.

378
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,380
Your number.

379
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,690
We'll exchange numbers anyway
since we're a team now.

380
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,150
Don't you think it'll be fun?

381
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,380
We'll see.

382
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,440
Think of it like bungee jumping.

383
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,180
It'll be thrilling
since you'll be working with me.

384
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,490
So what should our presentation be on?

385
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,790
How about success stories in marketing?

386
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,250
No, it's a topic easy to do research on,

387
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,320
so another team could beat us to it.

388
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,060
Can't we say that we called dibs?

389
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,250
No.

390
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,240
A common topic won't make us stand out.

391
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,880
We won't get good grades
even with a good presentation.

392
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,820
What's your idea then?

393
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,790
An analysis on marketing strategies
that failed.

394
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,750
It sounds fresh.

395
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,050
I don't know any better,
but it'll make us stand out.

396
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,470
-Don't you agree?
-What?

397
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,060
Is it a good one?

398
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,360
I don't know. You guys can decide.

399
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,480
It doesn't sound too bad.

400
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,410
Isn't it a cheap trick to go that route

401
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,570
just because success stories seem to easy?

402
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,500
The conclusion will be the same.

403
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,410
Something like
"Failure is the mother of success."

404
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,050
So-bin, what do you think?

405
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,330
Well...

406
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,510
It sounds like fun.

407
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,310
It's not meant to be fun.

408
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,680
But...

409
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,140
An analysis of failed marketing strategies

410
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,480
is a topic that covers
a wide range of views.

411
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,560
So just like Jung-ho said,

412
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,900
it could seem like
we're just twisting the words.

413
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,720
It’s why I think

414
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,580
focusing on a top-tier product

415
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,910
falling down the ladder
due to failure in marketing

416
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,150
and examples of marketing strategies

417
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,510
that couldn’t adjust to
the needs of consumers could be better.

418
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,550
Unbelievable. So-bin, I'm impressed.

419
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,360
I was just voicing my opinion.

420
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,220
Do we have our topic then?

421
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,600
I guess we do,

422
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,540
so now we should decide on team leader.

423
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,090
You're the oldest here, so of course

424
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,140
it should be you.

425
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,430
What? How does that make sense?

426
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,600
Apart from Jun, we're all juniors here,
so why does age matter?

427
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,740
Are you volunteering?

428
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,250
No, I have other team projects to manage.

429
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,100
What about Soo-hyun?

430
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,050
He seems to have the professor's trust.

431
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,170
Let's make this simple
and put it to a vote.

432
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,150
It'll be between Jung-ho and Soo-hyun.

433
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,600
What do you say?

434
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,740
Sorry? Well, I'm fine with
either of you being--

435
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,720
You seemed confident when
suggesting the topic,

436
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,170
so why not be the team leader?

437
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,330
What?

438
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,790
I vote yes.

439
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,170
How can she when she's mostly invisible?

440
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,400
I saw at the orientation

441
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,040
that she was hard-working
and had a good sense of responsibility.

442
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,020
Someone like that should be team leader.

443
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,440
He's right.
So-bin has that quality to her.

444
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,260
-I vote for her too.
-Hold on a second.

445
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,580
Same here.

446
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,640
Majority rules then.

447
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,470
In the next class, the team leader
will inform the professor

448
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,100
of our team and topic.

449
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,320
Are you leaving already?

450
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,270
The pretentious jerk.

451
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,250
It's impossible to like him.

452
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,920
Did you notice he didn't order anything?

453
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,960
Life would be a bore
without odd people like him.

454
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,240
Odd?

455
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
He's not odd.
He's just the ultimate psycho.

456
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,090
Do you know what happened
during my freshman year?

457
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,760
When I first met him, I mean.

458
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,840
Soo-hyun!

459
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,620
Can you treat us to a meal?

460
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,020
I'm Park Hye-ji,
a freshman in the department.

461
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,840
And I'm Lee Ki-sun.

462
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,690
So?

463
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,670
Sorry?

464
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,050
Why must I buy meals to strangers

465
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,420
who I haven't met before?

466
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,860
We're sorry.

467
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,560
Talk about a new kind of jerk.

468
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,010
What did I tell you?

469
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,710
He may be good looking,
but he's an annoying jerk.

470
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,110
Darn it.

471
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,270
So you're freshmen.

472
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,070
That's right.

473
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,810
How well did you do
on the language section of your CSAT?

474
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,840
I got a level two.

475
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,290
You got the subject wrong.

476
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,650
Sorry?

477
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,070
The one begging for a free meal

478
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,800
is the annoying kind.

479
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,960
-I see.
-Be a better judge of character

480
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,130
and figure out
who'd actually treat you to meals.

481
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,060
That would've been a cool sight to watch.

482
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,800
You can clearly imagine how Soo-hyun was.

483
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,910
He's not wrong though.

484
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,690
Seniors shouldn't have
to blindly treat their juniors.

485
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,070
Wait. Did you just take his side?

486
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,550
Of course not.
I'm just saying he has a point.

487
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,150
What about a senior student
stealing a freshman's job?

488
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,410
Are you going to keep making me
feel guilty over what's been settled?

489
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,010
Yes.

490
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,990
I must really be an easy target to you.

491
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,440
That's what I like about you.

492
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,700
Yeo Jun, I don't appreciate it all.

493
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,030
I can be scary when angry, you know.

494
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,700
Boy, I'm trembling.

495
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,410
Anyway, I'll see you, Scary One.

496
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,300
I have a call to make.

497
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,980
Right. Sure thing.

498
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,000
Hello?

499
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,730
It's on Friday night.
Your aunt and uncle will be there too.

500
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,250
Right. It's been a while
since I saw you and Father.

501
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,320
Do you actually miss us?

502
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,190
[Of course. I miss home-cooked meals too.]

503
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,570
Don't lie just because I can't see you.

504
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,900
I can hear it in your voice.

505
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,250
[I'm not fond of having you here either.]

506
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,840
[It's not like
you're someone to be proud of.]

507
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,230
[Since your brother's busy,
you'll have to do instead.]

508
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,220
What can I do
when I have a limited number of sons?

509
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,470
[Be here even if you don't want to be.]

510
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,720
Right. I'll see you then.

511
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,360
Don't be your usual self
and be here on time.

512
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,230
-Sure.
-That reminds me.

513
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,930
Is your hair still a mess?

514
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,830
[I don't want to burn my eyes out,
so clean yourself up.]

515
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,990
[Your brother
never had his hair like that.]

516
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,940
Yes, Mother. I'll do just that.

517
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,740
Don't you worry.

518
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,110
[I'm not fond of having you here either.]

519
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,710
[It's not like
you're someone to be proud of.]

520
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,950
[Since your brother's busy,
you'll have to do instead.]

521
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,350
[Is your hair still a mess?]

522
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,160
[I don't want to burn my eyes out,
so clean yourself up.]

523
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,540
[Your brother
never had his hair like that.]

524
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,090
My gosh.

525
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,530
Can you please get up?

526
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,560
[Nam Soo-hyun]

527
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,740
Will you drink it?

528
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,840
I'll take these too.

529
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,730
Your total is 4,400 won.
Do you need a bag?

530
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,580
No.

531
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,800
It's for you.

532
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,130
Please forget what you saw.

533
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,370
What?

534
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,900
It's nothing.
You work so hard. Just drink it.

535
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,200
-Take them.
-You're welcome.

536
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,390
You're here.

537
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,860
Got eyes in the back of your head?

538
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,160
I have a sharp sense of smell.
Your perfume.

539
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,960
Did you have a beer?

540
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,470
No, maybe you did.

541
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,260
Mi-ju, are you all right?

542
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,900
Yes, he's not the only guy in the world.

543
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,980
Oh, right. There's only one guy for you.

544
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,460
Did you have dinner?

545
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,570
Dinner?

546
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
No, I don't think so.

547
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,120
Do you want cup noodles?

548
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,940
One, two, three, four. Hold your breath!

549
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,320
That's it.

550
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,340
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Exhale!

551
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,190
Good. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

552
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,150
Great job. Good boy.

553
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,950
Who are you?

554
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,210
Hey, friend. Doesn't it help you
clear your mind for a moment?

555
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,090
-Not sure.
-Come on. I've tested it on my friend.

556
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,210
And? Did it work?

557
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,110
No, it didn't work on her.

558
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,880
This isn't enough for her
because she thinks way too much.

559
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,730
She needs me to help her
declutter her mind

560
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,670
by chatting her up nonstop.

561
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,170
You're a good friend.

562
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,510
What? What's this?

563
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,840
Are you jealous?
I can tell from that look in your eyes.

564
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,170
Come on. You're the one
who has the most friends!

565
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,190
Do you know me?

566
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,050
No, but I've heard a lot about you.

567
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,340
Yeo Jun, the most popular guy
at Myungil University!

568
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,870
But I don't have any good friends.

569
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,690
Honey, what are you doing?

570
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,090
Well, let's enjoy this sweet night air
together again next time.

571
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,480
[Rent, Books, Academy]

572
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,930
[Living Expenses, Phone and Internet]

573
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,200
[Don't lie just because I can't see you.]

574
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,360
[I can hear it in your voice.]

575
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,920
-You're already here.
-I just got here.

576
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,040
Hi, Soo-hyun.

577
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,510
Don't do things like this by yourself.

578
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,530
This isn't a team leader's job.

579
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,040
Come on. All you need to say is,
"Thank you."

580
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,180
You're so cranky.

581
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,870
He's right though.

582
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,670
Get me to do it since I'm the youngest.

583
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,670
Anyone who's here first can do it.

584
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,010
Did you call everyone else on the team?

585
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,730
Yes, they all said
they'll be here on time.

586
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,330
Actually, Hye-ji can't come.
She's coming down with a cold.

587
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,700
I guess it'll be just the five of us.

588
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,940
This is our first meeting
for the assignment.

589
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,570
Where is everyone?

590
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,240
Is this your first group assignment?

591
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,220
-Except for electives.
-Yes.

592
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,270
For required courses,
there are three every semester.

593
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,770
You'll hear all kinds of excuses.

594
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,240
I think there are two types of people.

595
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,360
Those who are responsible
and those who aren't.

596
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,990
Both Jung-ho and Chun-guk
aren't checking their phones.

597
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,270
They're not picking up either.

598
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,970
I should've double-checked with everyone.

599
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,570
I'm really sorry.

600
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,870
The fewer people there are,
the easier it'll be.

601
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,410
We're here anyway,
so let's divide up the workload among us.

602
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,050
Without the others?

603
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,420
Then what? Are we going to keep waiting?

604
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,160
Then I'll let them know
which parts they should work on.

605
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,890
Do you trust they'll do the work?

606
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,440
Sorry?

607
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,210
It's hard to forgive someone
who betrays your trust.

608
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,160
It's easier to just think
they were never on the team.

609
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,000
You're always so negative.

610
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,280
I'd say, I'm a realist.

611
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,270
If that's what it's like to be a realist,
I don't want to be one.

612
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,530
But it must be hard to be positive
if you're down in the gutter.

613
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,880
I get it.

614
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,290
You get it?

615
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,820
Do you even know what that means?

616
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,040
I sure do. Being broke isn't
the only reason you end up in the gutter.

617
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,070
I hope you're not
one of those pathetic losers

618
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,790
who attack innocent people

619
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,560
because they think no one else is
more miserable than they are

620
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,800
when they don't even know
others' situations.

621
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,600
They do that
because they have too much ego.

622
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,460
I'm...

623
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,620
I'm the team leader,

624
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,920
and I don't want to give up on anyone.

625
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,530
We'll divide it up into six parts.
If they don't do their parts,

626
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,240
I'll do their work.

627
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,960
Then I'm out.

628
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,100
Wait, Soo-hyun!

629
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,460
What do we do?
If he's out, we're seriously doomed.

630
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,790
Don't worry. I'll bring him back.

631
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,220
Chun-guk, what happened?
I called you several times.

632
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,080
We were playing billiards
and lost track of time.

633
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,280
Did you guys drink?

634
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,860
The loser had to buy chicken and beer.

635
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,110
Nam Soo-hyun, you jerk!

636
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,730
Hey, what did you just say about my age?

637
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,220
Say it again.

638
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,300
I said, you're 26,
and you need to act your age.

639
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,160
You jerk.
You think I'm a complete joke, don't you?

640
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,280
Because you played billiards
and drank beer,

641
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,430
we wasted our precious time.

642
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,540
What a way to set an example.

643
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,100
You little jerk! Got a death wish?

644
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,140
Look at you. You dodged it? Get back here.

645
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,430
Come at me, jerk. You're so dead.

646
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,720
Jung-ho! Please calm down.

647
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,950
We're at school now.

648
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,320
Get off of me.

649
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,550
Help me calm him down.

650
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,180
Hey, just leave him be.

651
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,680
-Nam Soo-hyun deserves to get beaten up.
-Chun-guk, please!

652
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,760
You're drunk. Please don't cause trouble.
Just leave, okay?

653
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,270
Have you all gone mad?

654
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,120
Yeo Jun, let go.

655
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,750
One, two...

656
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,390
You, Chun-guk, and I should go
for another drink. Come on.

657
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,170
Jun!

658
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,250
Jun, are you okay?

659
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,600
Hey, don't look down on us
just because your family's rich.

660
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,890
We know that you belittle us
behind our backs.

661
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,740
Where do you think you're going?
You little...

662
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,150
Don't hit him!

663
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,190
Just talk it out! Why must you hit him?

664
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,730
Don't hit him!

665
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,100
Don't...

666
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,470
Jun.

667
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,080
Don't hit him...

668
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,060
It's okay.

669
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,610
Just a second. It's almost done anyway.

670
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,100
-Here...
-I can do it.

671
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,660
Do you think Jun will be okay alone?

672
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,540
Why don't you go see him
if you're that worried?

673
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,840
I don't know where he lives.

674
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,860
I have to go. I have my shift.

675
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,590
Wait, Soo-hyun.

676
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,030
For the assignment...
Are you really going to leave the team?

677
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,680
You said you'd make it up to me.

678
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,030
Could you do that now?

679
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,930
Don't leave the team. We need you.

680
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:01,490
What if the team members cause trouble?
Will you cover for them

681
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,120
as the team leader?

682
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,380
No, I was wrong about that.

683
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,160
Everyone's grade should reflect
how hard they worked.

684
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,440
All right. Then I'll stay.

685
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,130
Really?

686
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,810
One more thing.

687
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,110
I suppose I have a lot to make up for.

688
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:34,270
You see, Jun isn't normally like that.

689
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,690
I don't know why he did that earlier.

690
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,650
Please try to understand.

691
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,950
So you know what he's normally like?

692
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,190
Jun always smiles a lot,
and he's very sociable.

693
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,400
I don't think he's usually that sensitive.

694
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:53,890
I guess you're right.

695
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,150
But I refuse to try to understand him.

696
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,600
I simply can't.

697
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,850
Okay.

698
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,850
Is my team going to be okay?

699
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,200
Get in.

700
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,020
You said you were headed home.

701
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,380
I can go by myself.

702
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,750
Just get in.

703
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,820
Mom called me first. I didn't call her.

704
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,210
I told you to let me know
if you were ever going home.

705
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,700
I don't want to do that.

706
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,750
Why do I have to do that?

707
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,260
Why do I need your permission to go home?

708
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,840
Because it's not your home.

709
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,360
So you're not my brother.

710
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,840
Put on your seat belt.

711
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,100
That mischievous rascal.

712
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,530
I envy you. Your younger son is adorable.

713
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,400
And your elder son is the youngest
doctorate degree holder and professor.

714
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,970
Myung-hoon, you've done a great job
raising your boys.

715
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,170
A man must have big goals.
I expect more from them.

716
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,110
Doesn't Jun-wan look more handsome
in person than on TV?

717
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,920
Yes, he does.

718
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,260
Chan-woo got into
Seoyul University, you know.

719
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,760
He'll attend Jun-wan's alma mater.

720
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:49,810
That doesn't mean
they're on the same level.

721
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:57,020
Jun, what are you majoring in
at Seoyul University?

722
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:04,460
I didn't get in. I'm studying Business
at Myungil University.

723
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,440
Oh, right!

724
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,650
Everyone else in the family attended
Seoyul University, so I forgot.

725
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,370
Sorry about that.

726
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,470
My school's great, Auntie.

727
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,230
Jun-wan teaches at my school, you know.

728
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,470
That's true.

729
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,680
I totally thought he'd get a position
at either Seoyul University or HAIST.

730
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,750
but you got transferred to
Myungil University?

731
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,950
Seoyul University,
which we graduated from, isn't that

732
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,040
different from Myungil University
which Jun is going to.

733
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,770
Not different? That's ridiculous.

734
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,750
Despite the standards of
Korean universities,

735
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,820
none of them produced a noteworthy scholar

736
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,240
or has an outstanding
educational environment.

737
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,510
We should get going. I have other plans.

738
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,360
-Already?
-Let's go.

739
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,460
Why don't you stay a little longer, Jun?
It's been a while since you came.

740
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,830
Come on.

741
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,700
-You go ahead.
-Yes, go ahead Jun-wan.

742
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,060
You said you had other plans.

743
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:29,160
Go ahead. Mother must've missed me.

744

Come out when I call you.

745
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,690
Are you smiling?

746
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,400
Is this funny to you?

747
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:49,130
You were laughing and bragging
about your school, weren't you?

748
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,730

749

750
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,520

You're the problem!

752
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,260
Why did you call this

753
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,760

754

Are you out of your mind?

755

Please stop, Father. It's all my fault.

756

Understand?

759
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,630
Arrogant brat.

760
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,320
I'll get going then, Mother.

761
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,200
Does it hurt?

762
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,810
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

763
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,060
Of course, it does.

764

No...

766

-I shouldn't have interfered...
-No...

It's all on me.

769
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,350
It's my fault for thinking
you'll behave yourself today.

770

No...

771
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,730
It's my fault for giving birth
to you in the first place.

Look at your brother.

I gave birth to you both.

776

So why can't you be as good as Jun-wan?

777

I know... I'm trying my best.

778

This is why I hate you.

I told you to
dye your hair black, didn't I?

784

Stop making excuses!
You're always like that!

786
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,800

00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:14,950
Okay.

Even though you're saying "okay"

789

fooling us on the inside.

-Right?
-No, of course not.

792

I wonder how many more times
you're going to fool me.

I promise I'll go.
