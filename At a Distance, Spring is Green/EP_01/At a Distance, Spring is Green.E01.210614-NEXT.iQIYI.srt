00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,770
People who think a lot
tend to make fewer mistakes.

532
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,750
[You have mediocre grades
and aren't licensed to do anything.]

533
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,790
["Better late than never" means that
you’re truly far behind.]

534
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,470
[I guess it's my fault. I'm sorry...]

535
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,710
[That may not be the case.]

536
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,230
[People who think a lot
tend to make less mistakes.]

537
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,530
Don't you lie to my face, jerk!

538
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,660
You obviously know
that I have a crush on Mi-ra.

539
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,730
How could you do that

540
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,580
and still call yourself my friend?

541
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,950
Did she say that she and I dated?

542
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,860
That's right, jerk.
I heard about everything at the reunion.

543
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,500
I had planned to tell her how I feel
that day.

544
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,530
But she kept crying
and talked about you nonstop.

545
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,780
Got anything to say?

546
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,200
She wanted to go to the movies
on her birthday, so we did.

547
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,220
We had dinner, and I took her home.
That's all.

548
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,070
Then why didn't you tell me?

549
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,390
Because it wasn't important.

550
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,550
You have a crush on Mi-ra?

551
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,450
I told you back in 10th grade.

552
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,180
I told you to stay away from her
because I like her!

553
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,990
You betrayed my trust, you jerk.

554
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,800
You're really drunk.

555
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,100
Where do you think you're going?

556
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,250
Go to bed.

557
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,240
Watch out!

558
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,190
What the...

559
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,270
Let go! Get off of me!

560
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,640
I will kill you all!

561
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,420
Darn it!

562
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,690
Get him out of here.

563
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,200
You're bleeding.

564
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,790
You know where the first aid kit is?

565
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,070
-Yes.
-It's okay.

566
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,140
No, it's not okay.

567
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,030
The team leader will be held responsible
if freshmen cause trouble.

568
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,040
I was touched for a second,
thinking you were worried about me.

569
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,600
Let's go.

570
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,070
You're so dead.

571
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,280
Where do you think you're going?

572
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,110
Well...

573
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,290
It might scar. Make sure
you go see a doctor, just in case.

574
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,940
Will do.

575
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,730
[Ointment]

576
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,430
Why did you guys fight?

577
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,120
We didn't fight.

578
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,190
I was just trying to handle
a drunk friend.

579
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,920
He seemed really angry though.

580
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,480
You see, being nice to everyone

581
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,040
can lead to misunderstanding at times.

582
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,390
Popularity comes with a price.

583
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,280
Wait.

584
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,240
I know this isn't the right time
to bring this up, but...

585
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,000
What is it? Just say it.

586
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,200
That's why you've been
stealing glances at me.

587
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,250
What? How did you know?

588
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,140
It shows on your face.

589
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,840
Well...

590
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,180
If I say this,

591
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,570
you may think that
I risked my life to protect you

592
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,680
because I had a hidden agenda,

593
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,270
but that really wasn't the case.

594
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,440
I did that without hesitation
because my protective instincts kicked in.

595
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,910
Okay, just relax and get to the point.

596
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,980
The research gig for Professor Song.

597
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,050
Can't you please let me do it?

598
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
That's why you didn't hesitate
for a second to come to my rescue.

599
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,540
No, it's not that. Trust me.

600
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,750
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't want to do that.

601
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,960
Then, let's pretend
you didn't hear what I just said.

602
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,410
Not for free.

603
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,760
I'll think about it
if we can become close.

604
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,320
That's it?
Then you'll let me have the position?

605
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,870
My goodness.
Don't think it'll be that easy.

606
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,350
Being my real close friend,
not a fake one...

607
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,370
It's really hard.

608
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,920
I'll do my best. What should I do first?

609
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,120
We'll take things slow.

00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,840
You know where the first aid kit is?

615

-Yes.
-It's okay.

00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,800
No, it's not okay.

617
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,310
Befriending a guy like me
won't help you anyway.

618
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,360
Even if we're not friends,
your college life won't be affected.

What are you looking at, all spaced-out?

621
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,520
Do you want to try bungee jumping?

622
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,980
I'm afraid of heights.

623
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,000
Then it'll be even more thrilling.

624
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,640
If you do it,
you'll realize it's no big deal.

625
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,060
Do you want to try?

626
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,990
I'll do it with you. It'll be fun.

627
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,290
Just hearing about it makes me queasy.

628
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,420
You'd better do it
if you want to be my friend.

629
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,180
What?

630
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,820
You should be a little adventurous
if you're that desperate.

631
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,750
Why don't you just do it?

632
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,120
Can you spare me a moment?

633
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,860
We're leaving

634
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,280
at noon, right?

635
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,420
I was mistaken.

636
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,190
-Pardon me?
-Your e-mail.

637
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,610
I found it in the spam folder.

638
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:16,060
It must've ended up there because of
the spam trigger word in the subject.

639
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,940
-Then...
-It was my mistake after all.

640
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,280
But you're partially responsible too.

641
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,670
-Sorry?
-You should've asked me right away.

642
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,140
There's nothing I can do now

643
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,290
because the semester is already over.

644
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,500
I couldn't bring it up
because I was intimidated by you.

645
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,450
You never listened to the team members.

646
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,780
-What I'm saying is...
-You suffered because of my personality.

647
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,130
I'm sorry.

648
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,060
I'll make it up to you
if the chance arises.

649
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,760
No, it's okay.

He apologized to me,

651
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,940
so why do I feel so awful?

00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,920
What's awful?

00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,650
Oh, when did you get here?

654
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,290
Let's go bungee jumping.

655
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,010
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

656
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,680
How much time? Three days?

657
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,090
Not a chance. Let's go!

658
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,950
Gosh, my stomach is upset.

659
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,800
Then I should just keep the job.

660
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,530
Hey, wait up!

661
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,570
You're already here, you know.

662
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,120
I really can't do this. Just keep the job!

663
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,170
Some people just hover over what they want

664
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,780
and always hide or run away
when they have to make a decision.

665
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,770
Then they'd regret it over and over.

666
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,810
But you're not a coward like that.

667
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,210
You know what though?

668
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,260
This may be the last chance

669
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:34,440
for you to trust someone
and just let yourself go.

670
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,500
You'll feel differently after you jump.

671
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,840
-But...
-You have me.

672
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,000
Just trust me.

673
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,530
Can I

674
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,170
really trust you?

675
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,000
Ready to jump?

676
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,070
We're going to jump together.

677
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,540
I can't do this. I'm out!

678
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,820
Then I'll jump alone.

679
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,020
You came to my rescue last time,

680
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,570
so I wanted to do this with you
and keep you safe.

681
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,210
I really can't jump. I'm not doing this!

682
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,090
-That was nice.
-What?

683
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,810
Hey, do you want to grab
a drink next week?

684
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,360
-How about a cup of coffee?
-Sure.

685
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,340
-Alright. I'm going to take off.
-Bye.

686
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,530
Oh, hello.

687
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,200
Have you been to the department office?

688
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,520
What?

689
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,300
Did you tell them that you quit
the research gig for Professor Song?

690
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,480
Oh, I forgot.

691
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,680
You didn't tell them yet?

692
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,920
But I don't think

693
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,910
Did we make a proper deal
for the position?

694
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,700
- What?
- I mean, I am the one who brought it up,

695
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,030
but you're the one who jumped.

696
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,520
I don't think

697
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,500
I ever promised you my spot
if you bungee jump.

698
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,950
Yeo Jun! You said you'll...

699
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,780
Okay, fine. I was just joking.

700
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,590
I'll go to the department office
right now and tell them. Okay?

701
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,610
But you have to keep your promise too.

702
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,680
-What promise?
-You promised

703
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,480
we'll be close friends
if I gave you my spot.

704
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,160
We became close
through bungee jumping.

705
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,140
No, that's not going to cut it.

-Like that'll ever happen.

710
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,280
Figures. There's no reason
for you to come see me.

711
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,740
I've been transferred here.

712
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,670
I'll start giving lectures next week.

713

Pretend like you don't know me.

714
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,320
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

715
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,260
Which brand would you like?

716
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:17,720
Can't you tell which one I smoke

717
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,630
just by looking at me?

718
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,790
Just give me my regular.

719

How are you planning to keep your job
if you don't even know that?

I'm telling you, kids these days
are out of their minds.

722

No, not that one! The one next to it.

723
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,240
No. The one below it.

724
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,530
Yes, that one.

725

a million times!

Gosh, you... You studying English?

727

You're the one who shoved me first!

saw everything.

Hey.

And where did a jerk like you come from?

What? Gosh...

740
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,350
I'm letting this slide because I'm a man.

741

Hey, man!

742
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,220
You want a piece of me?
Where are you going?

743
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,250
Should I call the police?

744
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,540
Maybe I'll let it go

745
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,390

What brings you here?

752
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,040
I came to water your cactuses.
I don't want them to dry up.

753
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,630
If not for me, who will water them?

754
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:23,830
Eat.

755
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,420
I'm good. You eat up and go home.

Come on.

757

If I don't come see you at work,
I never get to see you.

758

I'd prefer to be left alone.

759
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,140
So you're saying I interrupted
your sweet break time?

760
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,220
Drink. All you need is alcohol, isn't it?

761
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,430
I'm only drinking
because you're here with me.

762

Right?

769
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,330
Now that I think about it,
I've never really thanked you.

770
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,770
I could've gotten into big trouble
that night if it weren't for you.

Thanks for helping.

I get that you're used to
people being kind to you

773

but I wasn't trying to help you.

774
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,870
You have an overinflated ego.

775

You're so crooked, you won't even accept
