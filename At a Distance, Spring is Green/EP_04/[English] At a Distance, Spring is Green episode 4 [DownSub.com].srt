00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,980
[So-bin]

187
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,240
[gather the materials
and go over them instead?]

188
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,140
[I'm really, really, really sorry.]

189
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,060
Maybe I should skip school today.

190
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,160
[Can't you tell the time?]

191
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,490
I'm only ten minutes late.

192
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,720
[Just ten minutes?]

193
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,740
[I told you to be on time.]

194
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,120
[Being punctual is the first step
to acing tests.]

195
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,450
[-Ten minutes is enough to--]
-I think I'm lost.

196
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm at the fountain, so meet me here.

197
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,150
Bye!

198
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,350
Such a nagger.

199
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,900
I took time off practice

200
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,360
to meet him between his classes.

201
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,080
He'll be a while, right?

202
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,450
Let's take a look around.

203
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,430
Him over there.

204
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,070
Seriously? Not again.

205
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,840
Bleaching your hair
damages your roots and scalp.

206
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,560
Is it your roots or scalp though?

207
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,940
-Mind your own business.
-I know from experience.

208
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,000
Soo-kyung,

209
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,200
you think I'm a boomer.

210
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,890
I'm most certainly not.

211
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,340
Then what are you?

212
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,260
All I wish
is to talk about life with students

213
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,540
over a meal.

214
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,680
There's so much I've experienced
that I want to tell them about.

215
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
That's what makes you a boomer.

216
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,380
It sure is hot outside.

217
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,760
What is he doing?

218
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,430
Can you believe it?

219
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,660
-Unbelievable.
-He's not that good though.

220
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,130
-Why isn't he getting up?
-He's good.

221
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,960
Soo-hyun!

222
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,910
We're in matching colors today.

223
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,810
Did you copy my look?

224
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,640
Take your pants off too
while you're at it.

225
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,100
Stride in your underwear.

226
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,650
You have a unique talent.

227
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,340
What would that be?
I have so many, you see.

228
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,150
You ignore what others say

229
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,350
and get in their faces with a smile.

230
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,390
Not to everyone, you know.

231
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,240
Just like you said,

232
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,750
I'm more like this
because you're hard to win over.

233
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,090
I just think
you're being pretentious like me.

234
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,510
Pretentious?

235
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,370
I laugh in people’s faces

236
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,280
and it seems like
you’re trying hard not to like me.

237
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,910
Isn’t that being pretentious too?

238
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,680
Hey, you laughed!

239
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,150
I don't know
why I'm trying to patronize you,

240
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,860
but listen up.

241
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,260
In this world,
there are people who don't like you.

242
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,470
That's true.

243
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,470
But I don't think you're not one of them.

244
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,460
I apologize.

245
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,570
I could see right through you

246
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,460
which is why I bothered to converse.

247
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,000
But, just forget about it.

248
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,760
You know how I am

249
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,480
and I treat everyone the same.

250
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,270
You can apologize

251
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,230
by treating me to a meal.

252
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,490
No one has ever
been treated to one by you,

253
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,380
and I'd like to be your first.

254
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,990
You won't agree to a meal that I buy,

255
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,720
-so treat me to one instead.
-Why would I?

256
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,210
You've got to be kidding me.

257
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,640
Look at him.
He can't take his eyes off Mi-ju.

258
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,500
You haven't found a model yet, have you?

259
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,920
-What about him?
-Forget it.

260
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,570
Excuse me.
Are you perhaps interested in modeling?

261
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,330
Sorry? A model?

262
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,370
-Don't.
-She's looking for one.

263
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,570
You'll be seeing her at least once a week.

264
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,250
What? Every week? With her?

265
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,760
-Stop it.
-Do you think you can handle it?

266
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,710
Of course.
I'm confident in the body I carry.

267
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,600
Why don't I show you?

268
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,470
What do you think you're doing?

269
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,670
Soo-hyun, it's...

270
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,100
Let's go.

271
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,900
Just a second!

272
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,520
Did I ask you to strip?

273
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,800
No, that was just me.

274
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,200
He's looking at us
as if we were sexually harassing you.

275
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,100
-Weren't you?
-Of course not!

276
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,510
Then I guess I misunderstood.

277
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,060
It's just that you were all ogling him.

278
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,890
Then apologize.

279
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,850
Apologize for the misunderstanding.

280
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,130
I don't think I can.

281
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,410
Who knows what's actually true?

282
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,250
Come on.

283
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,680
Hi, I'm Yeo Jun,
a younger classmate of Soo-hyun's.

284
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,790
What? A classmate?

285
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,870
This temperamental jerk
has one that talks to him?

286
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,810
Unbelievable.

287
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,410
I'm at least not as immoral as you.

288
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,030
Hold on, will you?

289
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,030
Thank you for being his friend.

290
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,840
I'm Nam Koo-hyun,
Soo-hyun's one and only brother.

291
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,990
It's good to meet you.

292
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,100
This is just fascinating.

293
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,050
Why is someone like you
friends with my brother though?

294
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,180
Does he have some kind of leverage on you?

295
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
Quit the nonsense and get going.

296
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,700
That hurts, darn it!

297
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,200
You said we'd see our room,

298
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,820
so I skipped practice and my meal.

299
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,790
I'm telling Mom.

300
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,390
Go ahead. Brag about

301
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,190
stripping in front of the girls too.

302
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,270
Would you like to eat with us?

303
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,080
I'd appreciate the saving.

304
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,060
-His nagging is just--
-Koo-hyun!

305
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,400
-Sure. Let's go.
-Sweet.

306
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,220
What should we have?

307
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,210
[Cash, Credit cards only]

308
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,820
-What's good?
-The pork cutlet.

309
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,220
I'll have the pork cutlet
and ramyeon with cheese.

310
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,560
I'll pay for it.

311
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,980
I thought that was a given.

312
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,230
No, this is a first.

313
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,240
Choose.

314
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,380
Go ahead.

315
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,700
What should I have

316
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,990
that would say I ate well?

317
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,080
Budae jjigae?

318
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,370
This hair isn't appropriate
for someone who wants to be police.

319
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,920
I won't be able to bleach my hair
as an officer,

320
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,330
so I'm enjoying these moments.

321
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,530
You sure are a nutjob.

322
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,920
Have some beef too.

323
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,260
-What about you?
-Eat your fill.

324
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,480
And comb your hair.
Just look at this mess.

325
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,170
Have some beans too.

326
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,720
Go on and stop being a picky eater.

327
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,050
Eat up.

328
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,120
Eat.

329
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,670
Unbelievable.

330
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,510
I'm off to the restroom.

331
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,000
That's a sweet watch you have.

332
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,020
Do you like it?

333
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,760
I'll get going then.

334
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,960
Come back here.

335
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,460
Why? What are you going
to nag about this time?

336
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,110
Don't skip your meals
and open the windows often.

337
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,760
Look after yourself more
and get some sleep.

338
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,080
Get going already.

339
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,280
Don't abandon my brother.

340
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,950
He's a poor guy, you see.

341
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,280
-Aren't you leaving?
-I'm going!

342
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,180
I'll see you around.

343
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,170
Aren't you going too?

344
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,680
I should.

345
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,040
You're quite affectionate
toward your brother.

346
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,120
Affectionate? What's that?

347
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,120
How you treat your brother
is exactly that.

348
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,990
What about you? Any siblings?

349
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,950
No, I'm an only child.

350
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,030
It's easy that way.
You have no one to be mindful of.

351
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,060
You should get going then.
Thanks for the meal.

352
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,510
Sure.

353
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,330
-Soo-hyun.
-What now?

354
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,130
Can I call you again?

355
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,200
No, don't.

356
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,970
You might call me first, you know.

357
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,970
That won't ever happen.

358
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,920
I was treated to a meal by Nam Soo-hyun.

359
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,030
You just don't know me yet.

360
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,930
Just go.

361
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,890
[So-bin]

362
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,240
Hey, it's my girlfriend.

363
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,620
You're adorable.

364
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,350
If only someone like you
were my girlfriend.

365
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,560
Hye-ji.

366
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,610
Why did you call?
Must you be this annoying?

367
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,040
[Oh, I'm sorry. Should I hang up?]

368
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,500
You're so gullible at times.

369
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,390
Are you really not coming?

370
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,810
[Yes, and it's what had me worried.]

371
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,940
[Can you mediate if anything happens?]

372
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,140
[It's your specialty.]

373
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,790
Why do people keep saying
I'm good at things?

374
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,340
[I'll count on you then. Thanks.]

375
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,100
[Bye.]

376
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,040
As if there would be
anything to worry about.

377
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,980
[Myungil University]

378
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,800
There's no need to act so primly.

379
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,200
Hye-ji, let's go for dinner.

380
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,180
-I'm good.
-Come on.

381
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,340
Hye-ji, please.

382
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,370
So-bin, Hye-ji, and I
emailed the materials we researched.

383
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,660
The others should hand them in right now.

384
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,830
Unbelievable.

385
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,710
Soo-hyun, you saw what I sent, right?

386
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,470
Let's discuss that first.

387
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,180
You did a vast research.

388
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,670
I get things done properly
once I put my mind to it.

389
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,780
However,

390
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,160
I can't say it was done properly.

391
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,300
What?

392
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,940
What do you mean?

393
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,980
I researched three marketing strategies.

394
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,130
I got carried away with the brand concept,

395
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,720
but there's a lot to work with.

396
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,920
Mijin Foods is a big company.

397
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,780
You ignored
the distribution network it has

398
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,860
and only focused on marketing
which is why it's not realistic.

399
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,010
There were many typos too

400
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,010
which are a result of you
not knowing proper grammar.

401
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,220
A lot of the materials overlapped too.

402
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,210
Are you sure you didn't
just copy and paste?

403
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,370
If Professor Park saw this,

404
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,170
he'll scold us for playing tricks.

405
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,630
Bad grammar and playing tricks?

406
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,410
Must you be this strict about things?

407
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,430
We're on a tight schedule,
so go easy on it.

408
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,630
Handing in your work
would speed things up.

409
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,070
Yes, of course. I should hand that to you.

410
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,440
But first,

411
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,250
there's something I must collect.

412
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,310
The other day, I only stepped back

413
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,990
because Jun had a fit.

414
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,950
You never apologized
for what you did though.

415
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,620
An apology?

416
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,020
Have you done your research?

417
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,780
How's that the issue right now?

418
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,630
Apologize, you jerk!

419
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,810
So,

420
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,060
you haven't done the work.

421
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,700
-You--
-Is it fun

422
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,150
to belittle people like this?

423
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,540
Being told off

424
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,220
for trying to play tricks
has done it for me.

425
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,470
I can't stay on this team.

426
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,830
I'll get going.

427
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,000
Right. I knew this would happen.

428
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
Try getting it done alone, you jerk.

429
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,710
Jun, come on.

430
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,130
Why didn't you go with them?

431
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,740
I don't know.

432
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,060
I'll do the research with So-bin,
so you don't have to contribute.

433
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,500
You're a freshman anyway.
I don't have any expectations.

434
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,020
Why do you assume that I can't contribute?

435
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,040
I could do a good job, you know.

436
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,960
Are you planning to toy around
with me this time

437
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,680
instead of So-bin?

438
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,620
When did I toy around with So-bin?

439
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,100
Some people should never be messed with

440
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,300
and you'll pay for it in spades.

441
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,800
You're one to talk.

442
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,790
If that were the case,
karma would eat you alive.

443
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,410
You said materials on Mijin Group
are hard to come by.

444
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,960
It'll make or break our presentation.

445
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,200
Put me in charge of it.

446
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,070
-You?
-Trust me this once

447
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,440
and see for yourself
if I'm toying with you or not.

448
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,930
I don't like getting disappointed
after trusting someone,

449
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,210
so don't overexert yourself.

450
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,300
It's for the coffee. Bye.

451
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,180
Is it that hard for you to trust me?

452
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,970
"Yes, Father. This is Jun."

453
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,480
"I'm sorry to catch you on a busy day."

454
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
"I have something to ask"

455
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,450
"regarding a school project."

456
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,990
No, that's too long.

457
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,990
[Mijin Group Secretary]

458
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,260
[Trust me this once]

459
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,730
and see for yourself
if I'm toying with you or not.

460
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,130
I don't like getting disappointed
after trusting someone,

461
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,450
so don't overexert yourself.

[Mijin Group Secretary]

463
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,790
[This is the secretary's office.]

464
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,610
Yes, of course.

465
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,810
I'll give you the intranet ID.

466
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,450
-Ms. Cha!
-Sir?

467
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,000
Who are you informing of our intranet ID?

468
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,200
[It's your son, sir.]

469
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,750
[He wanted the company files
that were never released.]

470
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,600
-My son?
-Yes.

471
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,180
Well, if my son wants those,
he should have them.

472
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,300
The CEO just approved it.

473
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,150
Gosh, thank you so much.

474
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,260
Goodness.

475
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,720
Does he need them for a thesis?

476
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,160
It's your youngest son, not your eldest.

477
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,710
What?

478
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,050
[You're the winner
of the Dissertation Writing Contest.]

479
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,240
[Congratulations.]

480
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,830
Hello?

481
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,390
Kim So-bin!
Congratulations on winning the contest.

482
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,430
What? No. You don't need to treat me.

483
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,710
Yes.

484
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,950
I'll think about what I want to eat.

485
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,310
Okay.

486
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,110
So-bin should take me out for dinner.

487
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,410
-You? Why?
-I'm the one who gave her the idea.

488
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,170
You did?

489
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,190
You only see the good in others.

490
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,100
She got the idea from the materials

491
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,000
I handed over to her
when doing research for Professor Song.

492
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,870
That's what you think.

493
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,250
-Do you have everything for the lecture?
-Yes.

494
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,690
-Professor Song.
-Yes.

495
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,100
The thing I told you about.

496
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,990
I have to submit all the paperwork
by today.

497
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,530
What?

498
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,460
Choose one out of the students
who are working for you,

499
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,750
and the selected student will receive
more financial aid.

500
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,980
Oh, that.

501
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,650
Right, So-bin won a prize

502
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,370
in a dissertation writing competition.

503
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,230
On a topic that is related
to what you're writing about now.

504
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,050
Really? I'm impressed.

505
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,600
-Then I should choose So-bin...
-Hey, come on.

506
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,550
I told you that I gave So-bin
the idea for it.

507
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,930
It was her first time,
so she was a bit lost.

508
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,560
Professor, I guided her

509
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,720
through your research
and the dissertation too.

510
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,240
To give you all the support
and assistance you need, ma'am.

511
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,230
Kim So-bin...

512
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,530
-Okay, then you can be my main assistant.
-Thank you.

513
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,140
See you later!

[Nam Soo-hyun]

515
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,880
My, who is this? Nam Soo-hyun!

516
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,050
Who knew we'd run into you here?

517
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,810
Are we invisible to him?

518
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,190
-I don't think he can see us.
-Get what you need and leave.

519
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,130
Don't cause trouble in my workplace.

520
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,550
Don't be so rude to your customers.

521
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,640
Buy something,
and I'll treat you like customers.

522
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,910
I'm so sorry! I'll pay for it.

523
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,330
Now, I'm a customer, right?

524
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,170
You'd better not do it.

525
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,900
Why not? Are you going to punch me again
like last time?

526
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,330
Even if you think I'm a complete joke,

527
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,620
you won't hit a customer. Right?

528
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,000
You immature jerk.

529
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,630
You're acting like a revengeful kid.

530
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,090
My foot! Hey, my foot!

531
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,510
My foot! My foot hurts!

532
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,830
Darn it.

533
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,780
Let go!

534
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,590
Hey, do you have a death wish?

535
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,650
-How dare you!
-Enough!

536
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,510
Darn it.

537
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,250
What are you doing to my friend?

538
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,450
Did you pass the exam or something?

539
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,360
You need to learn to enjoy
the small things in life.

540
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,200
You're always so serious.

541
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,500
Just pass the exam, please.

542
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,970
Let go!

543
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,710
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

544
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,290
It's cash.

545
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,400
Where did you get this?

546
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,820
Come on. It's just 100,000 won.

547
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,670
Hey, "just 100,000 won"?

548
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,840
You always work so hard,
so I did some gig work just for the day.

549
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,910
You'd better tell me the truth.

550
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,340
Hey, just let it go. It's really nothing.

551
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,530
Nam Koo-hyun.

552
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,370
Well, I just sold something
I got for free.

553
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,070
From your rich friend.

554
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,020
-Yeo Jun?
-Yes.

555
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,300
I told him I liked his watch,

556
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,710
and he said I could have it.

557
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,650
-And you accepted it?
-Hey.

558
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,140
Of course, I did. It's expensive.

559
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,820
Are you a beggar?

560
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,270
That's a mean thing to say.

561
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,860
What's wrong with accepting something
he doesn't need?

562
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,400
Is this it?

563
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,290
It's what's left
after paying for the gosiwon.

564
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,430
Hey!

565
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,820
[Youth Villa]

566
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,200
-Soo-hyun?
-[I'm in front of your place. Come out.]

567
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,700
Now?

568
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,300
Yes, I'll wait here until you come out.

569
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,330
Okay, give me a minute.

570
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,330
Soo-hyun.

571
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,510
Koo-hyun told me what happened.

572
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,930
Oh, that.

573
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,940
-Why did you do that?
-I gave it to him because he wanted it.

574
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,700
I can just buy another one.

575
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,860
I'm sorry.

576
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,190
For what?

577
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,490
I can't pay you back right away,
but I will.

578
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,070
Will that make you feel at ease?

579
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,620
You said I'd call you.
Were you referring to this?

580
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,250
-Did I say that?
-So, it all went according to your plan.

581
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,200
You made me call you first
and practically beg you.

582
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,740
That wasn't my plan.

583
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,860
You may never have found out.

584
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,200
What do you want from me?

585
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,750
What could it be?

586
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,650
Forget about the money.

587
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,900
I don't need money.

588
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,830
As you know, I can get it easily.

589
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,790
Can you warm up to me?

590
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,200
Nobody warms up to you
because they genuinely like you

591
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,650
without you having you trick them
like this or spend money on them?

592
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,510
That's right.

593
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,460
Nobody.

594
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,070
Don't you pity me?

595
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,350
Don't look at me like that.

596
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,120
You need money,

597
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,100
and I need love. It's the same thing.

598
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,050
You do everything in your power
to earn money.

599
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm just doing what I want to do
to get what I want.

600
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,180
All right.

601
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,480
You won. I'll do as you say.

602
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,450
Answer my calls.

603
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,310
I'll head in, then.

604
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,740
Kim So-bin!

605
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,850
So-bin, Kim So-bin.

606
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,320
So-bin, are you mad at me?

607
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,610
I knew you had your tutoring session here,

608
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,190
so I came to pick you up.

609
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,690
Who has such an amazing friend?

610
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,540
You do!

611
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,440
So-bin, don't be mad at me.

612
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,110
Leave me alone, please.

613
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,310
Why did you have to come by that day?

614
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,850
Someone told me

615
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,830
that was the best day to go to your place,

616
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,950
but I ended up humiliating myself.

617
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,710
Who told you that?

618
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,650
Don't tell me... Yeo Jun?

619
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,510
That's right!

620
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,150
My boyfriend said
that promises must be kept

621
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,520
and told me to go that day.

622
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,790
Are you actually seeing him?

623
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,590
You're joking, right?

624
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,710
-That's...
-You're not seeing him, right?

625
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,190
Right, no way! I knew it.

626
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,430
"I knew it"?

627
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,730
-What I meant was...
-What did you mean by that?

628
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,420
Were you saying I shouldn't even dream
of dating a guy like him?

629
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,980
Now, I'm relieved.

630
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,790
Yes, this is the So-bin I know.

631
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,210
The timid, sensitive girl
who can only yell at me.

632
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,010
This is the Kim So-bin I know.

633
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,620
Hey, were you not joking?

634
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,740
Hey! We've stayed friends
even after I got a girlfriend.

635
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,630
Why let that jerk ruin our friendship?

636
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,090
"That jerk"?

637
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,550
Don't call him like that.

638
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,000
Don't trust him.

639
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,000
He knew I'd have a girl over that day.

640
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,210
I told him.

641
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,710
So what?

642
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,660
Are you saying he told me to go over
to your place that day on purpose?

643
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,640
That's absurd.

644
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,810
[Yeo Jun]

645
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,250
[Why don't you tell him tomorrow?]

646
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,210
[If he says no, just come meet me now.]

647
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,720
I can't believe you called
right on time though.

648
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,430
Worry swept over me.

649
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,630
And regret.

650
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,770
He's been kind of creeping me out.

651
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,890
People like him aren't good for you
because you trust others easily

652
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,990
and tell them everything.

653
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,530
But you don't even know him well.

654
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,920
I know a lot more about Jun than you do.

655
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,530
So, you are serious about this.

656
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,040
Yes.

657
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,970
No more crush.

658
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,220
It's over now.

659
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,400
What about us as friends?

660
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,030
Not sure. I don't know.

661
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,560
I want to focus on myself now.

662
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,300
[Don't trust him.]

663
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,870
He knew I'd have a girl over that day.

664
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,800
[Please, I hope I'm wrong.]

665
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,260
[Nam Soo-hyun]

666
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,960
Hey, where are you?

667
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,160
Hi, Jun.

668
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,070
Can we meet now?

669
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,050
You call this a nice place?

670
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,420
To me, it is.

671
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,750
I'll go easy on you
since you asked me to meet up first.

672
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,940
Well... Jun.

673
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,610
Yes?

674
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,810
I had such a long day today.

675
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,260
Soo-hyun and Jung-ho...

676
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,200
You can tell me about that later.

677
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,920
I want to ask you something.

678
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,840
What is it? You can ask me anything.

679
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,600
You know,

680
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,840
that day... The day I went
to Chan-ki's place to tell him how I feel.

681
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,700
Did you know

682
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,170
that his girlfriend would be over
that day?

683
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,200
Do you think I intentionally made you
run into her?

684
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,240
No.

685
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,440
Did you

686
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,560
see him?

687
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,790
Yes.

688
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,710
He came to pick me up
after my tutoring session.

689
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,190
Forget it, if that's not the case.

690
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,220
To tell you the truth,

691
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,040
I did wonder if you did it on purpose.

692
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,460
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,320
I did.

694
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,790
-What?
-I sent you there because I knew about it.

695
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,090
I wasn't sure whether
the timing would work out,

696
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,120
but I thought it could.

697
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,370
What you were wondering is true.

698
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,380
Why did you do that?

699
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,000
I wanted to end it for you.

700
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,390
I'm sure it's hard for you
to keep getting disappointed.

701
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,060
Was that the only way though?

702
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,340
It'd help you give up quickly.

703
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,720
Are you sure
you didn't want to see me get hurt?

704
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,310
Was it fun for you to watch me cry
like an idiot?

705
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,430
So he rejected you,
just as I had expected.

706
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,140
You should've stopped being so foolish
a long time ago.

707
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,480
Didn't I tell you?

708
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,420
You told me to use you.

709
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,810
What did you mean by that?

710
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,830
I hurt you,

711
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,260
so it's only right
that you gain something from me.

712
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,300
Yeo Jun.

713
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,150
That's the only thing
I've learned in life.

714
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,130
Give and take.

715
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,510
Nothing's free in life.

716
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,170
I was bound to get hurt
even if you didn't get involved.

717
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,450
I'm not trying to put the blame on you.

718
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,630
But I can't figure you out.

719
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,420
You scare me.

720
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,770
I don't think I can be friends with you
anymore.

721
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,150
We'll just be

722
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,930
teammates from now on.

723
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,160
I'm off.

724
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,740
[But you have to keep your promise too.]

725
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,030
You promised we'll be close friends
if I gave you my spot.

726
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,450
You'll do a good job, so don't worry.

727
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,920
[It'll be thrilling
since you'll be working with me.]

728
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,970
[This is my girlfriend.]

729
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:50,410
She's pretty, right?

730
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,610
[Didn't I earn that right?]

731
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,590
As your boyfriend.

732
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,060
[So he rejected you,
just as I had expected.]

733
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,510
You should've stopped being so foolish
a long time ago.

734
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,130
[Lee Hye-ra]

735
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,410
Okay, let's meet up.

736
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,620
Do you want to come up? I booked a room.

737
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,400
[Road Closed, Detour]

738
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,900
[Yeo Jun]

739
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,070
-[Soo-hyun.]
-Hey.

740
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,920
You picked up.

741
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,430
[Of course. I still owe you.]

742
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,410
[I'm working.]

743
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,080
-At such a late time?
-Yes. At such a late time.

744
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,490
I hurt someone

745
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,050
and I want to know
how to go back to the way things were.

746
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,520
[What are you doing over there?
Get back to work!]

747
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,660
[Yes, sir.]

748
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,710
[Just tell her how you feel
without embellishing.]

749
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,040
-That's it?
-You're bad at that.

750
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,030
Just do what you're bad at.

751
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:05,880
[Bye.]

752
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,700
I must be out of my mind.

753
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,240
Why am I doing this?

754
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,310
Hey, good actions lead to good fortune.

755
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,290
Do you want me to die of muscle cramps?

756
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,700
Do you have to say it like that?

757
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,190
Why do you get so many cramps?

758
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,000
Because I work my butt off
to make a living.

759
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,110
It's probably because
you're drinking all the time.

760
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,870
[So-bin!]

761
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,120
Hey, did you hear that?

762
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,350
[-So-bin!]
-Who is that?

763
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,380
-Yeo Jun?
-So-bin!

764
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,660
Did he follow me here?

765
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,780
Why do you think it's you?
Maybe he's looking for me.

766
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:24,940
-It's not you!
-It's not you!

767
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,580
Gosh...

768
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,910
-What are you doing here?
-I missed you.

769
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,510
Am I a joke to you?

770
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,940
I came because I didn't want things
to get out of hand. Just go.

771
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,390
I wanted to tell you how I feel.

772
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,090
So everything I heard until now
had nothing to do with your feelings?

773
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,630
Yes.

774
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,180
Please give me a chance.

775
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,910
No.

776
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,950
I don't want to hear this.
I won't be fooled anymore.

777
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,420
Telling you how I feel

778
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,850
is awkward and difficult for me

779
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,040
because I worry that you'll hate me.

780
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,960
Because love is something
you have to earn.

781
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,970
When I saw you have a hard time
with your crush

782
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,390
it felt like I was seeing myself.

783
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,570
I wanted to see that you couldn't
succeed even if you try

784
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,990
when I couldn't give up myself.

785
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,560
I thought I had control over everything

786
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,140
when I had no idea
I couldn't even control my feelings.

787
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:57,870
What are your feelings?

788
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,730
The moment I saw your tears I realized

789
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,290
what I did was wrong.

790
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,790
I realized if the girl I like is in pain,
it hurts me too.

791
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,270
I never knew that before.

792
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,350
I'm sorry I hurt you. I truly am.

793
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,000
-But...
-Next time.

794
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,770
I'll hear your answer next time.

795
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,100
I'm scared.

796
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,780
If you're going to be informal,
just keep being informal.

797
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,770
Just choose one.

798
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,170
I'll be off now.

799
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,680
-What's going on?
-Hey kid!

800
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,590
-What's the matter?
-What happened?

801
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,260
He just passed out.

802
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,770
-Are you okay?
-Call an ambulance! Hurry!

803
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:50,770
[Soo-hyun]

804
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,760
-Hey, Soo-hyun.
[-Hello?]

805
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,500
Isn't this Soo-hyun's phone?

806
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:02,300
[I'm calling from
the ER at Hosu Hospital.]

807
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,870
What?

808
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,360
Sir, can you please go faster?

809
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,210
Dad...

810
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,570
Is Mr. Nam Soo-hyun's guardian here?

811
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,330
Yes.

812
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,550
-Soo-hyun.
-What happened?

813
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,800
-Are you okay?
-Why are you here?

814
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,950
Do you remember collapsing
at the construction site?

815
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,420
They said you have malnutrition.

816
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,050
Didn't you hear me? You have malnutrition.

817
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,460
I don't care.

818
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,850
I'm going to call your brother and mother.

819
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,140
I heard that
you told them not to call your family

820
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,630
when you were rushed to the ER.

821
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,500
What are you doing here?

822
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,940
I called you and a nurse
at the hospital picked up.

823
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,050
Why did you call me again?

824
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,030
What am I, your girlfriend?

825
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,510
I wanted to thank you.

826
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,120
Thanks to your advice,

827
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,100
I got the courage to tell her how I feel.

828
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,130
Good.

829
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,310
Thanks for coming to the hospital
and not calling my family.

830
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,050
I keep owing you. I don't know
when I'll be able to repay you.

831
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,030
Do you have to repay me?

832
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,200
Aren't you that kind of guy?

833
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,240
When you spend money,
you expect something in return.

834
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,620
I was.

835
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,330
But I'm going to change.

836
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,540
Go ahead and change all you want.

837
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,180
Go. It's getting late.

838
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,910
Why are you always so angry with me?

839
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,730
I know.

840
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,250
Every time I see you, I just get angry.

841
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,420
I guess it's because my life sucks.

842
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,720
I don't even have time
to think about things like that,

843
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,520
but when I see you
I feel envious and angry.

844
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,270
Happy?

845
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,890
-I feel the same way.
-Just go

846
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,530
and stay out of my sight.

847
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,940
No.

848
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,110
I'm going to do what I'm good at

849
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,000
so you do the same.

850
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,520
What are you good at?

851
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,740
-Being clingy.
-What?

852
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,580
So you try to push me away.

853
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,220
Let's each do what we're good at.

854
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,680
[At a Distance, Spring is Green]

855
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,070
[No, don't do this, So-bin.
It'll only get you killed.]

856
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,440
[I heard you're going out with Jun.
Is that true?]

857
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,640
I'm going to call you
"honey" and "sweetie".

858
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,670
[You think this will make me
stay away from you?]

859
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,380
It's going to make me miss you for sure!

860
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,720
[You remind me of my brother
and it pains me.]

861
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,920
Unfortunately, you are my brother.

862
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,420
[So you want me
to stop being curious or clingy?]

863
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,360
You called to tell me
to get out of your sight?

864
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,310
Yes. I pited you.
I saw how anxious you were.

865
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,940
[-A fair face]
-That's her.

866
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,870
[-may hide a foul heart.]
-I know right?

867
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,760
[Are you curious about me?]

868
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:31,360
Yes. I'm curious about you.
