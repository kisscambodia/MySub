Where did you get
the money for Mom's surgery?

533
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,779
I borrowed it from a friend.

534
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,385
You're not the only one
with a rich friend.

535

Rich friend, who?

Let's have lunch together.

544
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,405
I'm actually meeting a friend.

545
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,535
Is that so? What about tomorrow?

546
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,605
I have class tomorrow.

547
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,189
It's best not to go through hardships
when you're young,

548
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,959
but later on in life,
those hardships become memories

549
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,415
you cherish.

550
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,069
Let's grab something to eat sometime.
It'll be my treat.

551
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,659
Thank you.

552
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,855
Okay.

553
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,715
I told you to pick your favorite menu.

554
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,935
This is my favorite menu.

555
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,565
Is that so?

556
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,655
Can I tell you a story about myself?

557
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,955
Sure, go ahead.

558
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,265
When I was in school,
I took a leave of absence three times.

559
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,415
I couldn't pay the tuition.

560
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,465
I didn't want to tell anyone,

561
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,645
and I would've rather died
than owe someone.

562
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,205
- I see...
- But

563
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,379
there was this one guy who would
always call me

564
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,975
and buy me a meal.

565
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,005
And I was able to get through those
hard times because of those meals.

566
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,805
It's painful for me to receive help
when I can't

567
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,745
return the favor.

568
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,515

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,505
Things will change.

Even if it seems like it never will.

571
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,595
I thought I was all alone,
but that was all in my head.

572
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,459
Open your heart, ask for help,

573
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,485
don't reject it, and stay strong.

574
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,125
If you go through all that hardship,

575
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,485

enough time to return the favor.

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,205

Thanks a lot for your help,
but don't do that again.

You've seen me anxious too.

Why do we keep letting each other
see the things

591
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,805
Right?

592
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,545
Do you know what's really miserable?

593
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,755
Being so broke

594
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,325
that you can't protect
those who are dear to you.

595
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:38,645
Some have nothing they want to protect
even if they have money to do it.

596

I'm more pitiful, right?

eventually.

604

Is your mother in serious condition?

605
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,515
She hurt her back while working
when she was young.

606

And it's been torturing her all her life.

I hope the surgery goes well.

608

You seem to have a good relationship

Do you also think that?

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,055
Isn't that why
you didn't like me at first?

614

You are not a sly hypocrite.

615

The things your mom says about you.

617
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,625
They're not true.

618
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,495
It's just her twisted opinion of you.

619
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,485
If someone ever says awful things to you,

620
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,775
it means that person is hurting inside.

621
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,975
Do not take it to heart,

There are three

The same goes for integrative growth.
There are three strategies.

Backward, forward,
and horizontal integration.

662

Soo-hyun, why do you keep
dozing off these days?

There you are. I wanted to eat with you.
What a coincidence.

What is this?
The way you talk is very similar.

685
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,425
Is it because you're roomies?

I like you.
