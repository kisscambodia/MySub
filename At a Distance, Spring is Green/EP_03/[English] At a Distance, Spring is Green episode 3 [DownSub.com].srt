00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,280
[Episode 3]

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,740
Get in.

3
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,270
If not, we'll talk tomorrow
at the school cafeteria.

4
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,110
Drop me off at the salon.

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
You go there too,
so you'll know where it is.

6
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm taking you home.

7
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,780
So that you can watch me
get scolded by Mother?

8
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,289
It's a pastime of yours, right?

9
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,500
You do everything
you're asked to do perfectly

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,620
and laugh as you watch me fail.

11
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,890
Then don't come by anymore.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,440
No one in that house
misses you or wants you there.

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,229
You have no family.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,100
Pull over.

15
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,640
Pull over, darn it!

16
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,870
Thanks.

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,160
Thanks for the lift

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,490
and the advice.

19
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,729
But moreover,

20
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,120
thanks for reminding me that
you're a psychopath.

21
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,740
[This is why I hate you.]

22
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,210
[Deceiving people while wearing
that fake smile is your specialty.]

23
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,910
No one in that house
misses you or wants you there.

24
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,710
[You have no family.]

25
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,430
Hey, it's me.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Are you free right now?

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,740
Let's call the others for a drink.

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,870
Of course, I'm buying.

29
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,130
Let me pour you a glass.

30
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,980
-Are your glasses filled?
-Of course.

31
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,880
There's no tomorrow,
only a blinding today!

32
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,420
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,520
-Are you drunk?
-Yes.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,450
-I bet you're not.
-Here.

35
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,120
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

36
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,360
He's gone though.

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,690
He's out of it.

38
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,050
Hey, Jun.

39
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,300
You need to pay for the drinks!

40
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,720
He dragged us here saying he'd buy.

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,520
He already picked up the tab.

42
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,020
This is Jun we're talking about.

43
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,020
He proved his worth once again.

44
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,030
Once again.

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,930
Guys, I...

46
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,360
Life must be so easy for him.

47
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,410
He's handsome, popular, and rich.

48
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,880
What could possibly worry him?

49
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,820
He should be scolded for having one.

50
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,990
Could not worrying
make life boring though?

51
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,420
Guys, let's drink to that. Cheers!

52
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,350
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,340
Can you please get up?

54
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,280
Take them.

55
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,740
That was embarrassing.

56
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,770
What's wrong?

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,330
It's nothing.

58
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,880
I must've sighed too loudly.

59
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,820
Yes, enough for
the whole building to hear.

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,150
Just let it out.

61
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,700
You can consider me as a pretty wall

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,460
since I won't engage.

63
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,250
I have heaps of research to do

64
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,990
and a professor
who only accepts top-notch presentations.

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,730
I also need to go over a mock Q and A.

66
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,060
Jun's only a freshman,

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,890
so I don't know if Soo-hyun and I
can handle it all.

68
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,450
What if the team members cause trouble?
Will you cover for them

69
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,300
as the team leader?

70
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,180
How did he know that they'd cause trouble?

71
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,520
[Soo-hyun]

72
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,800
-Have it on vibrate!
-Why is he calling at this hour?

73
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,070
Aren't you going to pick up?

74
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,050
Yes, Soo-hyun.

75
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,210
Jun said what?

76
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,760
What's wrong?

77
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,050
I need to step outside for a bit.

78
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,030
Who's calling you out at this hour?

79
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,870
Could he be interested in you?

80
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,280
He's not the type.

81
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,790
Either he is or isn't.
Type has nothing to do with it.

82
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,050
He's just wired a little differently.

83
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,040
That's how he is.
Anyway, I'll see you later.

84
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,790
Don't make a sound.
You'd better not wake me up!

85
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,680
Jun?

86
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,580
So-bin, it's you.

87
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,440
How did you know I was here?

88
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,470
Soo-hyun said you'd be here.

89
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,810
You guys must be close.

90
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,410
Except me...

91
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,830
Are you okay? How much did you drink?

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,540
Not much...

93
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,190
I can drink more.

94
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,710
Let's go drink more...

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,670
What's wrong? Can you pull yourself up?

96
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,490
So-bin.

97
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,650
Can you please like me?

98
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,410
Why won't you answer?

99
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,320
Don't you like me?

100
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,300
So you hate me too.

101
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,700
It's not that I hate you.

102
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,770
Right?

103
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,380
I knew you of all people would like me.

104
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,559
I knew you'd like me.

105
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,330
Actually,

106
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,159
I like someone else.

107
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,320
What?

108
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,760
There's someone else I like.

109
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,040
What?

110
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,370
I can't like you
because I have feelings for someone else!

111
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,920
Jun, can you get a grip on yourself?

112
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,820
Jun, are you asleep?

113
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,630
-Hey.
-Is he asleep?

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,830
Soo-hyun?

115
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,900
Give him to me.

116
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,830
Sure.

117
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,930
Do you know where he lives?

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,530
What? I don't.

119
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,570
I think Hye-ji knows though.

120
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,660
Oh, no.

121
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,030
Could he have heard what I said?

122
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,950
[Youth Villa]

123
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,810
This seems to be the place.

124
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,810
Oh, no.

125
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
Unbelievable.

126
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,870
We're almost there.

127
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,010
Jun, what's your door lock combination?

128
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,200
Jun?

129
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,620
I've done enough.

130
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,250
Just a second.

131
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,140
It's a biometric lock.

132
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,550
Could you bend down a little?

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,500
A little closer.

134
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,450
Could you lift him up slightly?

135
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,180
Darn it.

136
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,890
Darn these fingers. Work with me!

137
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,240
Yes! That's a good boy.

138
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,250
It worked! Soo-hyun, hurry inside.

139
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,070
You must be exhausted.

140
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,180
Your jacket.

141
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,360
-Please take it off and I'll--
-Why should you?

142
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,190
You're right.

143
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,440
I probably earned the right
to use the bathroom.

144
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,550
Same here. I probably earned the right
to get a glass of water.

145
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,330
What is it?

146
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,310
Nothing.

147
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,260
-The cup's overflowing.
-My gosh!

148
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,580
Would you like some water?

149
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,100
[Did he hear what I said or didn't he?]

150
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,990
[Should I ask?]

151
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,600
Thanks.

152
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,240
Soo-hyun, wait.

153
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,050
Did you perhaps hear

154
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,210
what I said earlier?

155
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
I mean,

156
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,850
I hope you heard me
thanking you for carrying him here.

157
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,530
It was exhausting for you too.
We should go.

158
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,350
Sure.

159
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,470
Doesn't something seem to be up with him?

160
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,680
I really think something's up.

161
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,920
So-bin.

162
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,700
Can you please like me?

163
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,020
He's liked by everyone, so why me?

164
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,660
Is something troubling him?

165
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,290
Your mind's running off to places again.

166
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,630
Yours don't though.

167
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,790
Because I don't care about others.

168
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,860
As if.

169
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,510
After getting his call,
you sent me looking for him.

170
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,540
Then you came by and carried him home

171
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,390
to his house.

172
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,810
I call that caring.

173
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,430
I talk a lot, don't I?

174
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,140
I didn't want his last call
to be have been to me

175
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,990
which is why I called you.

176
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,410
I followed you there though

177
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,240
because I didn't want to put you out
more than necessary.

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,900
Right. If you hadn't shown up,

179
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,630
we would've stayed there all night.

180
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,430
Anyway, you did good.

181
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,090
-This is where we ended up.
-Good night.

182
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,090
Did you purposely walk me back?

183
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,530
I'd rather you not tell Jun that I came.

184
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,760
Why not?

185
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,140

00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,200
the guy you like
is handsome but unreliable.

364
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,220
You've been friends with him
for a long time,

365
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,160
but he always blows you off.

366
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,490
He's a playboy
who's always with a different girlfriend?

367
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,600
If you put it like that,
he doesn't seem nice.

368
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,440
That's not how he is though.

369
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,520
You're tortured by false hope.

370
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,680
[Does it hurt?]

371
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,730
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

372
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,710
Of course, it does.

373
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,320
You believe that person could love you

374
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,670
and get your hopes up over small gestures.

375
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,760
Just tell him how you feel.

376
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,310
How I feel? That's insane.

377
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,670
How is that insane?

378
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,930
You can't move on until this is resolved.

379
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,920
Just tell him.

380
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,530
I could take the leap with you
just like I did when bungee jumping.

381
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,380
It's been going on for so long

382
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,980
which makes it harder.

383
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,890
I don't even know where to begin.

384
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,480
Just say whatever you want.

385
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,250
Why are you worried
when you're this pretty?

386
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,200
Stop saying things like that!

387
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,530
You'll be someone
who breaks too many hearts.

388

389

-You--
-Wait a second.

392
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,540
Would I regret this?

393
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,910
What if you end up dating him?

394
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,440
Stop it.
What do you mean I'll be dating him?

395

What? Look at you beaming.

396

No can do. I'm done helping.

397

But you lit the fire first.

398

Don't tell him how you feel.

399

401
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,110
I'd rather you not confess.

402

539
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,080
He said he has to find a job
that offers room and board.

540
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,250
What? He's going to get another job?

541
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,670
A job that offers room and board?

542
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,910
Your brother is out of his mind.

543
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,200
Darn it. Nam Soo-hyun, this fool...

544
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,260
That's yours.

545
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,420
Hey, is everything okay with you
these days?

546
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,150
Yes, it's the same always.

547
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,470
Everything's okay?

548
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,110
What about your jobs? Nothing new?

549
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,930
No, nothing new.

550
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,390
Okay.

551
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,410
I'm off.

552
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,800
Already?

553
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,990
Hey.

554
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,320
Am I really your friend?

555
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,490
What do you mean?

556
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,290
You seem to have forgotten that
since you're so tired these days.

557
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,250
How could I, when you're my only friend?

558
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,780
-It'll be just a moment.
-Thank you.

559
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,290
Excuse me.

560
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,120
Hey, Young-ran.

561
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,880
He's a great guy.

562
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,960
Put in a good word for him with your boss.

563
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,010
Okay, thanks.

564
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,900
Would you stop that?

565
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,750
-What?
-Enough, okay? Don't look prettier.

566
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,260
You're teasing me again.

567
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,710
I think I picked the wrong day.
Don't I look weird?

568
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,010
No, you look perfect.

569
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,430
Really?

570
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,590
Yes, really.

571
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,280
Kim So-bin, is that really you?

572
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,040
I almost didn't recognize you!

573
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,020
My gosh, what's going on?

574
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,180
Hye-ji is still prettier.

575
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,290
You're right about that.

576
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,830
What's up, So-bin?

577
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,160
I didn't even know you existed

578
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,070
since we rarely see you around.
But, what's gotten into you?

579
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,180
For a moment,
I thought Jun brought his girlfriend.

580
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,260
You thought So-bin was Jun's girlfriend?

581
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,630
Give me a break.

582
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,500
Hello, Soo-hyun.

583
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,310
Soo-hyun.

584
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,480
Doesn't So-bin look
totally different today?

585
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,390
Let's get started.

586
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,540
I think I studied too hard today.

587
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,010
I'm parched.

588
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,180
How about a drink? What do you all say?

589
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,450
I have plans.

590
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,780
See you tomorrow, Soo-hyun.

591
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,730
He nods at you at least.

592
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,970
That obnoxious jerk.

593
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,180
Does he think he's the boss?
What's with the arrogant nod?

594
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,200
Jun! Where are you going?

595
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,370
Look at him following Soo-hyun
like a puppy.

596
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,320
Soo-hyun!

597
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,610
Soo-hyun!

598
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,790
Did you carry me home?

599
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,730
Who said that? Kim So-bin?

600
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,180
No.

601
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,330
She wouldn't tell me.

602
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,590
I found out
because you left some traces behind.

603
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,350
-Like what?
-Your hair.

604
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,410
I sent it in for a DNA test,
and the results say it's your hair.

605
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,210
I wonder why I called you.

606
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,640
I mean, you're so cranky.
You'd just hurt my feelings.

607
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,320
Do you get your feelings hurt?

608
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,700
I'm hurt.

609
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,500
Let me buy you dinner.

610
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,230
You carried me home,
and I puked on your clothes.

611
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,090
You did nothing to put up with that.
It's solely my fault this time.

612
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,600
I guess you're bored. Find someone else.

613
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,590
You must've come to my rescue
because you were worried

614
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,730
although you don't like me.

615
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,880
Stop following me.

616
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,030
You said weird stuff,
so I just felt responsible.

617
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,360
You felt responsible?

618
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,870
Did I say I wanted to die?

619
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,760
I suppose you say that often

620
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,580
without knowing
what it's really like to want to die.

621
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,760
-Do you really hate me that much?
-Yes.

622
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,090
That was quick.

623
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,700
I guess you're being clingy because
I'm not reacting the way you want me to.

624
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,780
But you see,
you can't control everything in life.

625
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,200
I can.

626
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,060
Don't follow me.

627
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,480
I don't have time to waste with you.

628
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,470
I was hoping he'd have changed a little.

629
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,340
I didn't know my enemy lived so close.

630
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,940
-"Enemy"?
-That's right.

631
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,050
Because he may hurt you,

632
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,130
although we don't know that yet.

633
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,380
Should I just go home?

634
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,810
Does this look that weird?

635
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,380
Chan-ki bought me this bracelet
at a stationery store when we were eight.

636
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,240
I see.

637
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,620
Anyway, I should get going. Bye.

638
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,650
I hope he didn't forget about today.

639
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:52,220
[Chan-ki]

640
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,470
[How about chicken and beer for dinner?]

641
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,110
[Okay! I'm In!]

642
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,310
Ta-da!

643
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,200
-It's you again.
-Oh, I...

644
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,280
I came to the wrong house.

645
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,160
Hey!

646
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,970
-So-bin!
-You left your bag...

647
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,750
Is today a special day or something?

648
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:42,910
Did you come here to see me?

649
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,060
-No.
-Who else lives here besides me?

650
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,830
It's not that...

651
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,760
Hey Jun.

652
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,980
[If not, just come to me.]

653
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,490
Yes, I will.

654
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:17,100
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I came to the wrong place.

655
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,110
-Who's that?
-I came to find Jun,

656
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,180
but I came here.
I guess it's a force of habit.

657
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,720
Jun... Yeo Jun?

658
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,810
What's going on? So-bin!

659
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,700
So-bin!

660
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,220
What are you doing out there?
Come on inside.

661
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:59,380
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.

662
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,150
You mean the same thing
Seong-chan's parents did?

663
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,410
I feel like I did something wrong.

664
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,730
Like what?

665
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,570
I didn't do my homework,

666
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,380
and didn't eat broccoli.

667
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,190
If it was because of that my parents
would've gotten divorced already.

668
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,660
You're good at everything
and I'm a trouble maker.

669
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,250
What do mean? I'm not good at anything!

670
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,560
I have to choose if I'm going to
live with my mom or dad

671
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,150
and I don't know what to do.

672
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,700
What's that?

673
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,770
A magic bracelet.

674
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,540
If you say "Hong Chan-ki appear!"

675
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,580
I'll appear
right in front of you like magic.

676
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,740
-You're lying.
-Try it out.

677
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,120
Hong Chan-ki appear!

678
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,580
Ta-da!

679
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,670
What are you doing?

680
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,750
[But you see,
you can't control everything in life.]

681
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,000
[I can.]

682
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,030
Come in.

683
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,820
You're really going to leave like that?

684
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,200
You want him to see you like that?

685
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,000
You helped me,

686
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,500
but everything got messed up.

687
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,890
Why did I go today of all days?

688
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,200
I should've gone some other day.

689
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,350
What difference would that make?

690
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,310
-Still...
-What happened?

691
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,190
He said he broke up with her months ago.

692
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,400
He said that he isn't seeing anyone.

693
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,230
Chan-ki

694
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,280
wouldn't lie to me.

695
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,360
I don't want to listen to this.

696
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,440
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

697
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,950
I'm going to take off.

698
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,750
You should get some rest too.
Sorry I bothered you.

699
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,480
So-bin.

700
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,370
Don't cry.

701
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,290
I'm not crying.

702
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,370
Just...

703
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,980
Seeing you again...

704
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,380
I'm sorry.

705
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,330
Why are you sorry?

706
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,500
I shouldn't have done it.

707
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,630
I had no idea I'd feel so bad about it.

708
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,600
Why did I tell you to tell him
how you felt about him?

709
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,670
No...

710
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,440
You didn't do anything wrong.

711
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,390
It was my choice.

712
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,020
I should get going now.

713
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,680
Use me.

714
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,790
I'll be your boyfriend.

715
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,920
You can use me to forget him

716
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,660
or to make him jealous.

717
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,910
Why would you go that far for me?

718
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,580
I can't take it anymore.

719
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,880
I can't stand to see you
acting like a fool.

720
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,570
What should I do?

721
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,600
You decide.

722
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,610
-Hey.
-Hey.

723
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,030
I heard something strange a while ago.

724
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,810
What? Were you really going to meet Jun?

725
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,270
I thought you were
making up an excuse for me.

726
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,720
Let's grab chicken and beer...

727
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,070
This is my girlfriend.

728
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,380
She's pretty, right?

729
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:55,620
[At a Distance, Spring is Green]

730
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,520
-Can I call you again?
-No. Don't.

731
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,850
Was it fun for you to watch me cry
like an idiot?

732
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,270
In this world,
there are people who don't like you.

733
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,380
But I don't think you're not one of them.

734
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,010
Why you little...

735
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,830
Then apologize.

736
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,070
Apologize for your misunderstanding.

737
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,350
[I don't think I can.]

738
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,210
[Trust me this once and see for yourself
if I'm toying with you or not.]

739
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,850
[I don't like getting disappointed
after trusting someone.]

740
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,960
[I hurt someone]

741
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,420
and I want to know
how to go back to the way things were.

742
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,060
[Just tell her how you feel
without embellishing.]

743
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:29,190
[You're bad at that.
Just do what you're bad at.]

744
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,600
-It's not you!
-It's not you!

745
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,610
What?
