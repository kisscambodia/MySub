[ Episode 3 ]

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,535
Get in.

3
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,065
If not, we'll talk tomorrow
at the school cafeteria.

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,905
Drop me off at the salon.

5
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,988
You go there too,
so you'll know where it is.

6
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,235
I'm taking you home.

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,575
So that you can watch me
get scolded by Mother?

8
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,084
It's a pastime of yours, right?

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,295
You do everything
you're asked to do perfectly

10
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,415
and laugh as you watch me fail.

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,685
Then don't come by anymore.

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,235
No one in that house
misses you or wants you there.

13
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,024
You have no family.

14
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,895
Pull over.

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,435
Pull over, darn it!

16
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,665
Thanks.

17
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,955
Thanks for the lift

18
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,285
and the advice.

19
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,524
But moreover,

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,915
thanks for reminding me that
you're a psychopath.

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,528

that fake smile is your specialty. ]

Hey, it's me.

26
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,035
Are you free right now?

27
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,535
Let's call the others for a drink.

28
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,665
Of course, I'm buying.

29
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,925
Let me pour you a glass.

30
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,775
- Are your glasses filled?
- Of course.

31
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:40,669
There's no tomorrow,
only a blinding today!

32

- Cheers!
- Cheers!

33
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,299
- Are you drunk?
- Yes.

34
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,239
- I bet you're not.
- Here.

35
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,915
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,155
He's gone though.

37
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,479
He's out of it.

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,839
Hey, Jun.

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,095
You need to pay for the drinks!

40
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,515
He dragged us here saying he'd buy.

41
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,315
He already picked up the tab.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,815
This is Jun we're talking about.

43
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,809
He proved his worth once again.

44
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,819
Once again.

45
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,709
Guys, I...

46
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,155
Life must be so easy for him.

47
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,205
He's handsome, popular, and rich.

48
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,675
What could possibly worry him?

49
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,615
He should be scolded for having one.

50
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,785
Could not worrying
make life boring though?

51
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,209
Guys, let's drink to that. Cheers!

52
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,145
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

Can you please get up?

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,075
Take them.

55
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,535
That was embarrassing.

56
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,565
What's wrong?

57
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,125
It's nothing.

58
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,669
I must've sighed too loudly.

59
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,615
Yes, enough for
the whole building to hear.

60
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,945
Just let it out.

61
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,495
You can consider me as a pretty wall

62
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,255
since I won't engage.

63
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,045
I have heaps of research to do

64
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,785
and a professor
who only accepts top-notch presentations.

65
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,525
I also need to go over a mock Q and A.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,855
Jun's only a freshman,

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,685
so I don't know if Soo-hyun and I
can handle it all.

68
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,245
What if the team members cause trouble?
Will you cover for them

69
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,095
as the team leader?

70
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,975
How did he know that they'd cause trouble?

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,589

- Why is he calling at this hour?

Aren't you going to pick up?

74
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,845
Yes, Soo-hyun.

75
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,005
Jun said what?

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,555
What's wrong?

77
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,845
I need to step outside for a bit.

78
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,825
Who's calling you out at this hour?

79
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,665
Could he be interested in you?

80
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,075
He's not the type.

81
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,585
Either he is or isn't.
Type has nothing to do with it.

82
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,945
He's just wired a little differently.

83
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,935
That's how he is.
Anyway, I'll see you later.

84
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,685
Don't make a sound.
You'd better not wake me up!

85

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,475
So-bin, it's you.

87
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,335
How did you know I was here?

88
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,365
Soo-hyun said you'd be here.

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,705

Are you okay? How much did you drink?

92
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,435
Not much...

93
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,085
I can drink more.

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,565

Why won't you answer?

99
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,215
Don't you like me?

100
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,195
So you hate me too.

101
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,595
It's not that I hate you.

102
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,665
Right?

103
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,275
I knew you of all people would like me.

104
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,454
I knew you'd like me.

105
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,225
Actually,

106
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,054
I like someone else.

107
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,215
What?

108
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,655
There's someone else I like.

109
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,935
What?

110
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,265
I can't like you
because I have feelings for someone else!

111
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,809
Jun, can you get a grip on yourself?

112
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,715
Jun, are you asleep?

Oh, no.

Oh, no.

125
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,689
Unbelievable.

Jun?

129
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,515
I've done enough.

130
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,145
Just a second.

It's a biometric lock.

132
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,445
Could you bend down a little?

133
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,395
A little closer.

134
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,345
Could you lift him up slightly?

135

Darn it.

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,145
It worked! Soo-hyun, hurry inside.

to use the bathroom.

Soo-hyun, wait.

Sure.

Is something troubling him?

165
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,185
Your mind's running off to places again.

166
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,525
Yours don't though.

167
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,685
Because I don't care about others.

168
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,755
As if.

169
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,405
After getting his call,
you sent me looking for him.

170
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,429
Then you came by and carried him home

171
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,285
to his house.

172
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,705
I call that caring.

173
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,325
I talk a lot, don't I?

174
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,035
I didn't want his last call
to be have been to me

175
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,885
which is why I called you.

176
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,305
I followed you there though

177
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,135
because I didn't want to put you out
more than necessary.

178
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,795
Right. If you hadn't shown up,

179
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,525
we would've stayed there all night.

180
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,325
Anyway, you did good.

181
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,985
- This is where we ended up.
- Good night.

182
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,985
Did you purposely walk me back?

183
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,419
I'd rather you not tell Jun that I came.

184
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,649
Why not?

185
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,035

He's so forgetful these days.

537
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,979
I guess he's really tired.

538
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,185
He is? Why?

539
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,249
We have to move out.

540
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,675
He said he has to find a job
that offers room and board.

541
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,839
What? He's going to get another job?

542
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,259
A job that offers room and board?

543
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,505
Your brother is out of his mind.

544
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,795
Darn it. Nam Soo-hyun, this fool...

545
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,855
That's yours.

546
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,015
Hey, is everything okay with you
these days?

547
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,739
Yes, it's the same always.

548
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,065
Everything's okay?

549
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,705
What about your jobs? Nothing new?

550
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,525
No, nothing new.

551
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,985
Okay.

552
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,005
I'm off.

553
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,395
Already?

554
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,585
Hey.

555
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,915
Am I really your friend?

556
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,085
What do you mean?

557
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,885
You seem to have forgotten that
since you're so tired these days.

558
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,845
How could I, when you're my only friend?

559
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,375
- It'll be just a moment.
- Thank you.

560
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,885
Excuse me.

561
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,715
Hey, Young-ran.

562
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,475
He's a great guy.

563
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,555
Put in a good word for him with your boss.

564
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,605
Okay, thanks.

565
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,495
Would you stop that?

566
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,345
- What?
- Enough, okay? Don't look prettier.

567
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,855
You're teasing me again.

568
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,305
I think I picked the wrong day.
Don't I look weird?

569
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,605
No, you look perfect.

570
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,025
Really?

571
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,185
Yes, really.

572
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,875
Kim So-bin, is that really you?

573
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,635
I almost didn't recognize you!

574
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,615
My gosh, what's going on?

575
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,775
Hye-ji is still prettier.

576
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,879
You're right about that.

577
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,425
What's up, So-bin?

578
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,749
I didn't even know you existed

579
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,649
since we rarely see you around.
But, what's gotten into you?

580
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,775
For a moment,
I thought Jun brought his girlfriend.

581
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,855
You thought So-bin was Jun's girlfriend?

582
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,225
Give me a break.

583
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,095
Hello, Soo-hyun.

584
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,905
Soo-hyun.

585
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,075
Doesn't So-bin look
totally different today?

586
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,985
Let's get started.

587
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,135
I think I studied too hard today.

588
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,605
I'm parched.

589
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,759
How about a drink? What do you all say?

590
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,045
I have plans.

591
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,375
See you tomorrow, Soo-hyun.

592
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,319
He nods at you at least.

593
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,565
That obnoxious jerk.

594
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,775
Does he think he's the boss?
What's with the arrogant nod?

595
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,795
Jun! Where are you going?

596
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,965
Look at him following Soo-hyun
like a puppy.

597
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,915
Soo-hyun!

598
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,205
Soo-hyun!

599
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,385
Did you carry me home?

600
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,325
Who said that? Kim So-bin?

601
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,769
No.

602
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,919
She wouldn't tell me.

603
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,179
I found out
because you left some traces behind.

604
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,945
- Like what?
- Your hair.

605
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:44,005
I sent it in for a DNA test,
and the results say it's your hair.

606
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,805
I wonder why I called you.

607
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,235
I mean, you're so cranky.
You'd just hurt my feelings.

608
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,915
Do you get your feelings hurt?

609
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,295
I'm hurt.

610
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,095
Let me buy you dinner.

611
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,819
You carried me home,
and I puked on your clothes.

612
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,685
You did nothing to put up with that.
It's solely my fault this time.

613
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,195
I guess you're bored. Find someone else.

614
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,179
You must've come to my rescue
because you were worried

615
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,319
although you don't like me.

616
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,475
Stop following me.

617
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,625
You said weird stuff,
so I just felt responsible.

618
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,955
You felt responsible?

619
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,465
Did I say I wanted to die?

620
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,355
I suppose you say that often

621
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,175
without knowing
what it's really like to want to die.

622
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,355
- Do you really hate me that much?
- Yes.

623
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,685
That was quick.

624
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,295
I guess you're being clingy because
I'm not reacting the way you want me to.

625
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,375
But you see,
you can't control everything in life.

626
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,795
I can.

627
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,655
Don't follow me.

628
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,075
I don't have time to waste with you.

629
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,065
I was hoping he'd have changed a little.

630
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,935
I didn't know my enemy lived so close.

631
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,535
- "Enemy"?
- That's right.

632
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,645
Because he may hurt you,

633
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,725
although we don't know that yet.

634
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,975
Should I just go home?

635
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,405
Does this look that weird?

636
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,975
Chan-ki bought me this bracelet
at a stationery store when we were eight.

637
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,835
I see.

638
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,215
Anyway, I should get going. Bye.

639
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,245
I hope he didn't forget about today.

640
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:57,720
[ Chan-ki ]

641
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,065
[ How about chicken and beer for dinner? ]

642
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,705
[ Okay! I'm In! ]

643
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,905
Ta-da!

644
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,795
- It's you again.
- Oh, I...

645
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,875
I came to the wrong house.

646
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,755
Hey!

647
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,565
- So-bin!
- You left your bag...

648
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,345
Is today a special day or something?

649
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,505
Did you come here to see me?

650
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,655
- No.
- Who else lives here besides me?

651
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,425
It's not that...

652
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,355
Hey Jun.

653
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,575
[ If not, just come to me. ]

654
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,085
Yes, I will.

655
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,695
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I came to the wrong place.

656
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,705
- Who's that?
- I came to find Jun,

657
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,769
but I came here.
I guess it's a force of habit.

658
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,315
Jun... Yeo Jun?

659
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,405
What's going on? So-bin!

660
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,295
So-bin!

661
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,815
What are you doing out there?
Come on inside.

662
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:04,975
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.

663
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,745
You mean the same thing
Seong-chan's parents did?

664
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,989
I feel like I did something wrong.

665
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,309
Like what?

666
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,159
I didn't do my homework,

667
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,969
and didn't eat broccoli.

668
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,785
If it was because of that my parents
would've gotten divorced already.

669
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,249
You're good at everything
and I'm a trouble maker.

670
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,845
What do mean? I'm not good at anything!

671
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,149
I have to choose if I'm going to
live with my mom or dad

672
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,745
and I don't know what to do.

673
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,295
What's that?

674
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,365
A magic bracelet.

675
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,129
If you say "Hong Chan-ki appear!"

676
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,175
I'll appear
right in front of you like magic.

677
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,335
- You're lying.
- Try it out.

678
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,715
Hong Chan-ki appear!

679
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,175
Ta-da!

680
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,265
What are you doing?

681
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,345
[ But you see,
you can't control everything in life. ]

682
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,595
[ I can. ]

683
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,625
Come in.

684
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,415
You're really going to leave like that?

685
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,795
You want him to see you like that?

686
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,595
You helped me,

687
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,095
but everything got messed up.

688
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,485
Why did I go today of all days?

689
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,795
I should've gone some other day.

690
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,945
What difference would that make?

691
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,905
- Still...
- What happened?

692
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,785
He said he broke up with her months ago.

693
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,995
He said that he isn't seeing anyone.

694
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,825
Chan-ki

695
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,875
wouldn't lie to me.

696
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,955
I don't want to listen to this.

697
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,035
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

698
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,545
I'm going to take off.

699
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,345
You should get some rest too.
Sorry I bothered you.

700
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,075
So-bin.

701
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,965
Don't cry.

702
00:57:58,510 --> 00:57:59,885
I'm not crying.

703
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,965
Just...

704
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,575
Seeing you again...

705
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,975
I'm sorry.

706
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,925
Why are you sorry?

707
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,095
I shouldn't have done it.

708
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,225
I had no idea I'd feel so bad about it.

709
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,195
Why did I tell you to tell him
how you felt about him?

710
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,265
No...

711
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,035
You didn't do anything wrong.

712
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,985
It was my choice.

713
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,615
I should get going now.

714
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,275
Use me.

715
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,385
I'll be your boyfriend.

716
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,515
You can use me to forget him

717
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,249
or to make him jealous.

718
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,505
Why would you go that far for me?

719
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,175
I can't take it anymore.

720
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,475
I can't stand to see you
acting like a fool.

721
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,165
What should I do?

722
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,195
You decide.

723
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,205
- Hey.
- Hey.

724
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,625
I heard something strange a while ago.

725
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,405
What? Were you really going to meet Jun?

726
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,859
I thought you were
making up an excuse for me.

727
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,315
Let's grab chicken and beer...

728
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,665
This is my girlfriend.

729
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:07,975
She's pretty, right?

730
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:00,825
[ At a Distance, Spring is Green ]

731
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,109
- Can I call you again?
- No. Don't.

732
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,439
Was it fun for you to watch me cry
like an idiot?

733
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,859
In this world,
there are people who don't like you.

734
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,975
But I don't think you're not one of them.

735
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,605
Why you little...

736
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,425
Then apologize.

737
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,659
Apologize for your misunderstanding.

738
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,939
[ I don't think I can. ]

739
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,805
[ Trust me this once and see for yourself
if I'm toying with you or not. ]

740
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,439
[ I don't like getting disappointed
after trusting someone. ]

741
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,549
[ I hurt someone ]

742
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,009
and I want to know
how to go back to the way things were.

743
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,649
[ Just tell her how you feel
without embellishing. ]

744
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,779
[ You're bad at that.
Just do what you're bad at. ]

745
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,179
- It's not you!
- It's not you!

746
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,205
What?
