00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,915
There's a coldness to him,
but he seems nice enough.

708
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,185
Don't take that job.

709
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,575
- What?
- Don't work for Professor Yeo.

710
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,735
Just like that, I should drop it?

711
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,235
Yes, I'll introduce you to another gig.

712
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,115
- Why?
- Please don't ask why.

713
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,755
Why are you reacting this way?

714
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,495
Are you perhaps

715
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,365
related to him in any way?

716
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,055
Yeo Jun-wan and Yeo Jun...

717
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,205
That's not the case.

718
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,635
Then what is it?
I can't know unless you tell me.

719
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,865
You...

720
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,499
You don't intend
to ever tell me about you.

721
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,195
That's right. I don't.

722
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,115

to hear your story.

725

And I don't want to say it
no matter who asks.

726

727

Can we drop this?

728
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,355
You should answer that. I'll get going.

729

Well, he'll be here soon.

741
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,259
Anyway, I poured my heart and soul
into this recipe,

742

743

Did you see the anonymous post?

764
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,149
All her photos are edited

765
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,919
and she buys stuff so it looks like
she got matching things with Jun.

766
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,109
She's delusional.

767
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,429
How pathetic.

768
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,809
I heard Yeo Jun is dating Lee Hye-ra.

769

- How did you guys meet each other?
- Are you guys really dating?

770
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,125
Jun didn't confess to you first, did he?

771

- Tell us!
- Why can't you say anything?

773
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,879
Of course, she's not dating him.

Why won't you tell us?

775
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,089
Gosh, I feel bad for her.

776
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,289
She edits herself in Jun's photos

777
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,749
and buys the same stuff as him

778
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,329

- Exactly.

- Have you forgotten about what happened?
- What are you talking about?

794

There were a bunch of girls
who lied about dating you.

795

Is it the same for her?

796
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,025
She's so not your style.

This is all I've learned to do.

884
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,525
Are you sure you'll be okay with it?

885
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,555
This is the real me, Kim So-bin.

886
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,780
[ At a Distance, Spring is Green ]

887
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,969
[ Even though you like someone, ]

888
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,879
[ you still may not have
the time for a relationship. ]

889
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,119
[ That's how it was for me. ]

890
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,445
- With who?
- You.

891
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,899
[ Being so broke ]

892
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,920
[ that you can't protect
those who are dear to you. ]

893
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,280
[ Drop out form ]

894
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,919
[ You really care about me that much?
Enough to get revenge for me? ]

895
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,789
[ If someone ever says awful things to you,
it means that person is hurting inside. ]

896
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,899
[ Even if it's something
your parents said. ]

897
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,849
[ I don't know when the right timing is,
so I'm just going to do it. ]

898
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,085
I like you.

899
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,849
Are you all right? This is weird.

900
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,709
[ This is so unlike him.
Why is he smiling? ]

901
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,529
[ Don't think about the future.
Just live in the moment. ]

902
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,955
Jun, I never hated you.
