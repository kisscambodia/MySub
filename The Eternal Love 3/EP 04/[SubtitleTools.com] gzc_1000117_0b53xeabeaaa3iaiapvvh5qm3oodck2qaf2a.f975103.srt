=Episode 04=

16
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,910
What's bothering you, Brother?

17
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,830
Since when did you and the princess...

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,470
become this close?

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,720
You were absent, Brother,

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,160
so you might have misunderstood it.

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,550
What the princess said yesterday
wasn't utter nonsense.

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,320
She said that men shouldn't rely on women.

23
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,470
They should live their own life.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,000
Careless talk leads to trouble, Eighth Brother.

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
But don't you think that

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,800
this princess is quite different

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,160
from the one you used to know?

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,440
Tan Er almost drowned,

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,720
and shortly after, she survived an assassination.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,110
After these back-to-back traumas,

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,390
it's only normal that her personality changed.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,960
Please stop second-guessing.

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,750
Still,

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,160
be wary of the princess, Brother.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,520
I knew Tan Er since I was a child.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,240
Don't say what you said again.

37
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,440
Don't get blinded by love, Brother.

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,960
Official Su has arrived.

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,830
As per Her Majesty's request,

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,110
the eighth young master of the Mo family,
Mo Lian Cheng is to enter the palace.

41
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,550
Please, Eighth Young Master.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,030
Behave yourself. Do not bring shame
to the Mo family.

43
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,950
What's wrong with Mo Lian Cheng?

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,270
He dares to disrespect me?

45
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,670
Once you remember everything,

46
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,070
I'll make you suffer!

47
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,110
I'm different now.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,950
I'm a princess.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,830
You have to obey me.

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Your Highness.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,640
The eldest princess has sent an invitation,

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,950
asking you to visit her.

53
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,340
(Invitation)

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Why does she want to see me?

55
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,390
Ill-intentioned.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm not going.

57
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,600
Not going.

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,510
Noted. I shall take my leave now.

59
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,160
Wait!

60
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,070
Jing Xin.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,350
Do you have something to say to me?

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,040
Your Highness, I have thought hard about it,

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,670
but I can't understand one thing.

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,950
Are you like this because

65
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
you were too traumatized by the
drowning incident?

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,230
I am more than willing to travel far

67
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,270
to find you a medicine, Your Highness.

68
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,670
Jing Xin.

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,390
I know you've been

70
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,550
loyal to me.

71
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,070
I also know that

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,600
you must be thinking I've changed a lot.

73
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,920
Sometimes, I'll even start rambling.

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,880
It's just that at this moment,

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,760
I can't find a good explanation.

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
Just believe that

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,200
whether if it's in the past, the present,

78
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,160
or the future,

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
regardless of the timeline,

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,880
regardless of which Dongyue,

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
you are forever my best sister.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,670
If someone ever bullies you,

83
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,070
I'll be first to defend you.

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,510
I'm glad you're safe.

85
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,790
I might not know the words you used,

86
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,350
but I'll try to understand the context.

87
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,600
You're a princess after all.

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
You can't call your guard your sister.

89
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,070
Not to mention I said those harsh words earlier.

90
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,350
And you still...

91
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,480
It's okay, Jing Xin.

92
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,040
I know you care about me.

93
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,230
By the way, when we're alone,

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,790
don't call me Princess.

95
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,830
It sounds weird.

96
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,440
Just call me Tan

97
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,270
like you used to.

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
Tan?

99
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,830
Like I used to?

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,670
Your previous life.

101
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm forever your Tan.

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,320
Come on, say it out loud.

103
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,600
We're sisters, forever and ever?

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,110
Tan.

105
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,670
No! No! No!

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,390
I should just call you Your Highness.

107
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,110
I really...

108
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,350
Stop it.

109
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,550
Listen to me. No ifs or buts.

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,790
Don't get mad at me anymore, okay?

111
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,200
Yes.

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,110
Father.

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,480
The Bachelor School will start in three days.

114
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,230
All of you are to study there.

115
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,070
You represent the Mo family,

116
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,320
so watch your demeanor when school starts.

117
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,230
Behave properly.

118
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,270
Yes.

119
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,760
Yes.

120
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,880
Both of you can leave now.

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
I have something to tell Lian Cheng.

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go.

123
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,480
How are things going on the palace?

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,350
Her Majesty was trying to see

125
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,480
if I harbor ill will.

126
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,070
Perhaps she never trusted me.

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
It's not worth continuing further.

128
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,070
I see.

129
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,070
It seems like we can't proceed according to plan.

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,920
Be patient, Father.

131
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,070
It can be a blessing in disguise too.

132
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,790
You want to use the princess?

133
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,520
It's a possible route.

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,110
What she said yesterday leaves an opening for us.

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,030
You can rest assured, Father.

136
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,910
It is also my wish to free
the citizens from suffering.

137
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,230
Since it's my wish, I shall do my best.

138
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,880
Good.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,880
(Jingyi Pavilion)
As per the royal decree,

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,350
the Bachelor School will start today.

141
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,760
You are expected to behave yourself

142
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,790
and be a good husband.

143
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,470
In your future marital life,

144
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,640
you are to bring forth offspring and to
work hard without complaining.

145
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,640
Please open the first page now, everyone.

146
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,350
Read every word carefully.

147
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,080
(What else should I do)

148
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,440
(to make Qu Tan Er ask for my hand?)

149
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,150
What are you writing, Eighth Young Master?

150
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,030
I am merely taking note of
what you said, Official Su.

151
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,910
Just a few scribbles. Nothing of concern.

152
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,880
So you're saying that you were
listening to the lecture

153
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,000
with that preoccupied expression of yours?

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,910
As per the royal decree,

155
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,670
the Bachelor School will start today.

156
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,150
You are expected to behave yourself
and be a good husband.

157
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,840
In your future marital life, you are to bring forth
offspring and to work hard without complaining.

158
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,840
If I remember it correctly,

159
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,030
Official Su shall continue your lecture.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,280
We're all eager to learn here.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,760
Good.

162
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,590
Read carefully.

163
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,180

(Moral Codes for Men)

166
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,350
Please study every word carefully.

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,520
I will come back and check after two hours.

168
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,030
Fourteenth, if you have trouble
understanding the lecture,

169
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
feel free to ask me.

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,350
I...

171
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,280
I knew you weren't paying attention.

172
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,590
Let's start with Humility.

173
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,030
The third day after the birth of a boy,

174
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,000
you should place the baby below the bed,

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
give him a potsherd with which to play,

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,440
announce his birth to his ancestors
by an offering.

177
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,760
To lay the baby below the bed

178
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,030
shows that you are lowly and weak,

179
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,880
which means you should be...

180
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,230
Intimate contact with another bachelor.

181
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,440
Sent an expensive gift to a bachelor.

182
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,880
Eighth Brother, who's this bachelor?

183
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,520
Eighth Brother, what are you planning?

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
They sound...

185
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,280
Do not overthink this, Brother.

186
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,230
Princess is here!

187
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,030
Mo Lian Cheng.

188
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,280
Come out.

189
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,710
Eighth Brother...

190
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,790
(Fine then.)

191
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,080
(Now that you've done it in the public,)

192
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,320
(you'll have to marry me.)

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,470
What can I help you, Your Highness?

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,880
I know you must be tired from studying
so I came to cheer you up.

195
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,880
That's all?

196
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Yes.

197
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Well...

198
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,910
I came here to see you after class in person.

199
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,640
I even brought you some snacks.

200
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,880
Do you feel extra honored now?

201
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,790
Stay there!

202
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,790
I know the school starts today,

203
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,550
so I waited for the entire afternoon.

204
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,110
Is this your textbook?

205
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,710
Let me see what men

206
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,640
learn in this matriarchal Dongyue.

207
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,970
(Intimate contact with another bachelor.
Sent an expensive gift to a bachelor.)

208
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,380
(Peeking a bachelor.)

209
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,710
Aren't these what I did to you?

210
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,440
Your Highness kept disrespecting
the boundaries.

211
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,470
And now, my reputation is tarnished.

212
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,550
I'd like to know how Your Highness
will make it up for me?

213
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,550
So what I did to you

214
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,470
really bothers you then?

215
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,000
You want me to make it up for you.

216
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,230
So you want me to marry you?

217
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,710
What do you think, Your Highness?

218
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,110
Is this the real you, Cheng Cheng?

219
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,880
Who else do you think I am, Your Highness?

220
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,700
(Your Highness again? Seems like
he's not Cheng Cheng.)

221
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,840
(The eighth young master asked me to marry him.)

222
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,280
(If the real Cheng Cheng knows...)

223
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,760
Why? Are you reluctant to do so?

224
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,520
(Whatever. I just have to get this man first.)

225
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,550
Of course, I do.

226
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm very much

227
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,640
willing to so.

228
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,790
Read the next page.

229
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,500
(Three Orders and Three Rules)

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,640
Three Orders and Three Rules again?

231
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
How repetitive!

232
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,230
First order, no spilling secrets.

233
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,670
Second order, non-interference.

234
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,400
Third order, be honest.

235
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,910
Three Rules.

236
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,030
For daily interaction,

237
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,470
stay further than a one-arm distance.

238
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,280
For the bedroom,

239
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,840
a folding screen will be between us.

240
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,030
Lastly, no lovey-dovey

241
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,790
interaction.

242
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,230
Can you do them, Your Highness?

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,670
All see and no touch then?

244
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,000
Well...

245
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,910
No problem.

246
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,030
Shocked? Surprised?

247
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,880
As long as you marry me,

248
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,280
I'll agree to anything.

249
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,710
Do you really like me that much?

250
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,880
Of course!

251
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,080
A strong man is afraid of an obsessive woman.

252
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,760
What comes around goes around.

253
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm your karma.

254
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,440
In that case,

255
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,910
I shall visit you at night

256
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
to discuss our marriage at length.

257
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,470
Don't need to worry about dowry.

258
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,550
Just wait for the bridal carriage

259
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,200
like you're supposed to.

260
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,520
Jing Xin, does this look good on me?

261
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,030
Should I wear something lighter?

262
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,000
You look good in anything, Tan.

263
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,200
Really?

264
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,520
You don't look feminine enough.

265
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,520
What about...

266
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,800
Come.

267
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,590
I, the makeup guru, shall dress you up!

268
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
No thanks!

269
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,190
Come here!

270
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,680
Let's... not use this.

271
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,830
I'm going to give you

272
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,190
the most stylish hairstyle of the year.

273
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,830
Come on! Stay still.

274
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,680
Now you look cute.

275
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,520
Really?

276
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,640
Can't you knock, Cheng Cheng?

277
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,520
Make some noise at least.

278
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Are you trying to scare me to death?

279
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm meeting you at late night, Your Highness.

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,830
I cannot risk letting anyone know.

281
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,590
I'll take my leave.

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,070
Don't worry.

283
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,310
From now onwards,

284
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,800
as long as I'm here, no one can harm you.

285
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,590
After school, Her Majesty asked for my presence.

286
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,000
She was curious about the changes
in your personality

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,310
after the drowning incident.

288
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,310
Why are you staring at me?

289
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,000
What's so bad about the changes?

290
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,190
Isn't now much better?

291
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,160
Don't change the subject.

292
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,830
I think Her Majesty simply wished to see you.

293
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,800
You're a playboy!

294
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,430
It's fine that you attract other women,

295
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,400
but you attract an empress this time.

296
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,000
How am I supposed to win?

297
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,110
Such trouble!

298
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,400
Well, we can sever ties.

299
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,920
No!

300
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,590
That's not what I meant.

301
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,000
I meant to say that

302
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,160
you're as fine as wine

303
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,000
and...

304
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,000
and...

305
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
as dashing as the Prince Charming.

306
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,830
I do have literary talent.

307
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,430
(Look at how quick my reflexes are.)

308
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,640
(Every man)

309
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,110
(should learn from me.)

310
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,590
Since the empress is suspicious of you,

311
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,560
if you propose to marry me now,

312
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,110
it won't be easy.

313
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,710
I am the second princess of Dongyue.

314
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,430
I am allowed to marry whoever I want.

315
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,590
If you want me, then we need to work together.

316
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
Sure.

317
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Mo Lian Cheng, you wish to file a complaint
against the second princess?

318
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,070
Yes.

319
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,230
When Her Highness was recuperating
in the Mo Residence,

320
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,590
she molested me and...

321
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,520
Dirtied my body and

322
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,470
reputation.

323
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,950
I demand a fair judgment, Your Majesty.

324
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,710
This is nothing but a seduction attempt from
Mo Lian Cheng since he wasn't chosen

325
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,710
during the harem selection.

326
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,350
It was just a ruse from him.

327
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,350
He wanted to blame everything on me,

328
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,830
so I have to marry him.

329
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,470
He is after the prince consort position.

330
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,070
You...

331
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,680
But several days ago,

332
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,710
you asked me to meet you outside of the school.

333
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,110
Everyone saw that.

334
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,800
What excuses can you make this time?

335
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,160
I...

336
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,680
(Oh, no! I forgot my line.)

337
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,640
Since the princess is not willing to admit it,

338
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,280
Your Majesty, I implore you to exact swift justice.

339
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,230
(Even though we skipped several parts)

340
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,160
(that we discussed earlier,)

341
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,640
(but I still remember this part.)

342
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
(I can follow up.)

343
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,400
You just want me to take responsibility, don't you?

344
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I know I've fallen for your trick.

345
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,070
Arrange a marriage then, Your Majesty.

346
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,230
We wouldn't want him to spout nonsense

347
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,350
and risk having Your Majesty's reputation
be tarnished.

348
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,400
Whether Mo Lian Cheng has planned
all these or not,

349
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,520
have you really done something intimate to him?

350
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,590
(We didn't anticipate this question at all.)

351
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,040
(I have no idea what she's trying to achieve.)

352
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,920
(How should I answer?)

353
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,350
It seems like

354
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,470
the princess still refuses to
bear the consequences.

355
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,160
I was first accused of seducing Your Majesty,

356
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,280
and now, my chastity was called into question
by the princess.

357
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,280
I see no place for me in this world,

358
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,350
perhaps...

359
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
Perhaps I should just commit suicide.

360
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,470
Stop!

361
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,590
Like I said, I'll marry you.

362
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,190
Look at this mess you've caused.

363
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,400
You have indeed dirtied him,

364
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,800
but marriage is no trivial matter.

365
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,000
I shall issue a decree

366
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,070
to announce that the second princess
is free to choose her own spouse.

367
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,710
(That's a trap!)

368
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,190
(If I pick Mo Lian Cheng,)

369
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,920
(it means I really like him.)

370
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,070
(So this show we put up will be in vain.)

371
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,000
(What a pro! A cunning pro.)

372
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,190
Dismiss.

374
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,310
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

375
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,350
Let's see who she'll pick.

376
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,880
Everyone knows that the second princess
and Chen Er love each other.

377
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,350
If she didn't pick you,

378
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,800
wouldn't your plan be in vain?

379
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,160
You don't need to worry, Father.

380
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,230
The eldest brother seems to be upset
when learning this news.

381
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,680
Indeed. He is ready to get married,

382
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
but the second princess never requested
Her Majesty to arrange a marriage.

383
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,830
Instead, she is now asked to select her own spouse.

384
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,710
Of course, Chen Er will be upset.

385
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,000
What the second princess said might hold true,

386
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,560
but her disrespectful disposition will only do

387
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,190
more harm than good to my eldest brother.

388
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,590
But I know he is

389
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,160
loving the second princess

390
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,710
with his soul and heart.

391
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,880
They have feelings for each other since young.

392
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,230
If the second princess did not choose Chen Er,

393
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,590
I'm afraid he'd spend

394
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,350
the rest of his life as a monk.

395
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
Don't worry, Father.

396
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,310
I will not make things difficult for him.

397
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,710
Nice move.

398
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,560
Your Go skills have improved.

399
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,110
But Tan,

400
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,310
are you really going to pick the eighth
young master as your husband?

401
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,310
I believe that the eldest brother
is the best candidate.

402
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,950
You won't understand this, Jing Xin.

403
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,880
Love is a merciless one-way street.

404
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,280
On this street,

405
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,070
I see only Mo Lian Cheng.

406
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,190
Mo Yan Chen is a sweet guy,

407
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,190
but he's not what I want.

408
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
Let's go.

409
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,710
Cheng Cheng!

410
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,950
All right. One-arm distance.

411
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,400
Everyone else, please wait outside.

412
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,280
I want to have a private moment with him.

413
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,070
Your Highness seems to have noticed that

414
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,560
the decree of Her Majesty hides
an ulterior motive.

415
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So what?

416
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,190
I will still pick you.

417
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,880
What is she going to do? back out?

418
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,680
An empress will never renege on her promise.

419
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,070
However, more troubles might come in the future.

420
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,040
So you want to call everything off?

421
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,280
Are you regretting your decision now,
Mo Lian Cheng?

422
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,190
I have a strategy

423
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,190
to solve our current predicament.

424
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,920
Would you like to hear it, Your Highness?

425
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,920
Speak.

426
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,760
As long as you can be my husband,

427
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,920
if you ask for the stars, I'll never give you the moon.

428
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,190
Then marry my eldest brother too.

429
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,800
What?

430
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Are you crazy or did I mishear?

431
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,880
This sounds ridiculous!

432
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,950
You did not mishear me.

433
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
If you wish to marry me,

434
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,400
you'd need to marry my eldest brother too.

435
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,520
He's so going to regret this when he
got his memory back.

436
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,230
He might even kill himself.

437
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,160
I refuse. You will regret this.

438
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,110
I am a man of his word.

439
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,710
(As expected from a nutjob.)

440
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,350
(I know his craziness is incurable,)

441
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,820
(but I still need to do something.)

442
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,880
(Or else, when he turns into the real Cheng Cheng,)

443
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
(he'll not need to wait for lightning to strike him.)

444
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
(He can just kill himself.)

445
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,520
Nothing in this world

446
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,560
can escape from this axiom:

447
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,070
What a tsundere says will always backfire.

448
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,230
When you install a flagpole,
it will eventually fall.

449
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,880
Today, you give me your word.

450
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,950
Tomorrow, you'll wish to take them back.

451
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,190
If Your Highness is reluctant to do so,

452
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,110
then let's nullify our previous agreement.

453
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,040
We are strangers now.

454
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,000
I did this for you, okay?

455
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,560
Can't you see it?

456
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,800
And your final decision is...?

457
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,350
I'll count to three.

458
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,000
One, two,

459
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,160
three.

460
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,710
Fine.

461
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,920
Karma will come back and bite you.

462
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,110
Don't blame me when the time comes.

463
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,760
Deal!

464
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,350
Such decisiveness, Your Highness.

465
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,000
I believe we'll form a great team.

466
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,800
Mo Yan Chen is handsome.

467
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,110
If I ever fall for him,

468
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,310
don't you regret it.

469
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,520
Whoever regrets first is a dummy!

470
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,310
Promised.

471
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,470
Whoever regrets first

472
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,160
is a... dummy.

473
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,140
(Congji Hall)

474
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

475
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,520
Yan Chen.

476
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,280
You're the most considerate one
in the Mo family.

477
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,710
I'd like to arrange for you to be married
to the second princess.

478
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,110
What do you think?

479
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

480
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,800
I shall devote my life to the second princess

481
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
and shoulder her burden.

482
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
I've also decided that

483
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,920
Lian Cheng will be wed to her too.

484
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,950
Both of you can look after each other
and also the household.

485
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,760
(I suppose this is)

486
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,950
(to cease Lian Cheng's obsession
towards Her Majesty.)

487
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
(I'm fine with it,)

488
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,920
(but Tan Er took the short end of the stick.)

489
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,280
As you wish, Your Majesty.

490
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,950
(I'm surrounded by two men.)

491
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,000
(Why does it feel like)

492
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,710
(I have peaked?)

493
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,430
(Seems like it's all thanks to Mo Lian Cheng.)

494
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,110
(Might as well enjoy it.)

495
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,800
Both the prince and the eighth lord
bear the same intention,\.

496
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,760
What do you think?

497
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,160
(What's happening?)

498
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,470
Why aren't you taking my decree, Mo Lian Cheng?

499
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,800
(Tan Er! How dare you marry Mo Yan Chen!)

500
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,520
Marriage is no trivial matter.

501
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,430
Only if you follow your heart that
everything will end well.

502
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,310
I implore Your Majesty and Your Highness
to think twice.

503
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,230
(Mo Lian Cheng!)

504
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,760
(Why are you playing hard-to-get
all of a sudden?)

505
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,310
Once issued, the royal decree cannot be revoked.

506
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,560
(Oh, no! He's still in love with the empress.)

507
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,040
(If this carries on, it will end badly.)

508
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,830
I shall work with my eighth brother
to serve the princess,

509
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
to be the princess's right-hand men.

510
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,430
Now that this is settled.

511
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,400
Who should be the first husband?

512
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,680
(The empress is still trying to gauge
our reaction until now.)

513
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,110
(Now that we're here, might as well
go with her wishes.)

514
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,590
My brother is the eldest son.

515
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,640
He should be the first husband.

516
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,110
Tan Er.

517
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,400
What do you think?

518
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,230
(Mo Lian Cheng as my second husband?)

519
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,680
(Sounds exciting.)

520
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,520
As you wish, Your Majesty.

521
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,800
(Seems like Tan Er loves me after all.)

522
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,400
In this case,

523
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,590
proceed as you wish.

524
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

525
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I can't believe

526
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,230
I get to enjoy two husbands one day.

527
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,880
Never see this coming.

528
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,590
Indeed.

529
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,110
A decade-long dream has finally come true.

530
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,470
Thank heaven!

531
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,430
Tan Er, I...

532
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,800
Tan Er?

533
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,400
Eighth Brother?

534
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,190
What?

535
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,800
You're my second husband and now
you can't wait to exert dominance?

536
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,520
In the great hall,

537
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,430
I said only if you followed your heart that
everything would end well.

538
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,160
Did you not get what I said?

539
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,520
You churn out different drama every day.

540
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,560
Who knows what's in your mind?

541
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,230
Do you think I'd joke with my heart?

542
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,470
I once said that whoever we are,

543
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,110
regardless of the time and the distance,

544
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,760
I will find you, love you,

545
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,310
and marry you a thousand times.

546
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,830
Never separate in an eternity.

547
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Cheng Cheng!

548
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:50,300
♪Yet I still bet with this life♪

549
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,480
♪This longing, this pining♪
