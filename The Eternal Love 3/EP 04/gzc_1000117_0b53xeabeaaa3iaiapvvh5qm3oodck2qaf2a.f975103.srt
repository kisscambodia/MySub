=Episode 04=

16
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,910
What's bothering you, Brother?

17
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,830
Since when did you and the princess...

18
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,470
become this close?

19
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,720
You were absent, Brother,

20
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,160
so you might have misunderstood it.

21
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,550
What the princess said yesterday
wasn't utter nonsense.

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,320
She said that men shouldn't rely on women.

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,470
They should live their own life.

24
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,000
Careless talk leads to trouble, Eighth Brother.

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
But don't you think that

26
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,800
this princess is quite different

27
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,160
from the one you used to know?

28
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,440
Tan Er almost drowned,

29
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,720
and shortly after, she survived an assassination.

30
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,110
After these back-to-back traumas,

31
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,390
it's only normal that her personality changed.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Please stop second-guessing.

33
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,750
Still,

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,160
be wary of the princess, Brother.

35
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,520
I knew Tan Er since I was a child.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't say what you said again.

37
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,440
Don't get blinded by love, Brother.

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,960
Official Su has arrived.

39
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,830
As per Her Majesty's request,

40
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,110
the eighth young master of the Mo family,
Mo Lian Cheng is to enter the palace.

41
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,550
Please, Eighth Young Master.

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,030
Behave yourself. Do not bring shame
to the Mo family.

43
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,950
What's wrong with Mo Lian Cheng?

44
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,270
He dares to disrespect me?

45
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,670
Once you remember everything,

46
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,070
I'll make you suffer!

47
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,110
I'm different now.

48
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,950
I'm a princess.

49
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,830
You have to obey me.

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Your Highness.

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
The eldest princess has sent an invitation,

52
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,950
asking you to visit her.

53
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,340
(Invitation)

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Why does she want to see me?

55
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
Ill-intentioned.

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm not going.

57
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,600
Not going.

58
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,510
Noted. I shall take my leave now.

59
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,160
Wait!

60
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,070
Jing Xin.

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,350
Do you have something to say to me?

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,040
Your Highness, I have thought hard about it,

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,670
but I can't understand one thing.

64
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,950
Are you like this because

65
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
you were too traumatized by the
drowning incident?

66
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,230
I am more than willing to travel far

67
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,270
to find you a medicine, Your Highness.

68
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,670
Jing Xin.

69
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,390
I know you've been

70
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,550
loyal to me.

71
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,070
I also know that

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,600
you must be thinking I've changed a lot.

73
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,920
Sometimes, I'll even start rambling.

74
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,880
It's just that at this moment,

75
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,760
I can't find a good explanation.

76
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
Just believe that

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,200
whether if it's in the past, the present,

78
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,160
or the future,

79
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,440
regardless of the timeline,

80
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,880
regardless of which Dongyue,

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
you are forever my best sister.

82
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,670
If someone ever bullies you,

83
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,070
I'll be first to defend you.

84
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,510
I'm glad you're safe.

85
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,790
I might not know the words you used,

86
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,350
but I'll try to understand the context.

87
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,600
You're a princess after all.

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
You can't call your guard your sister.

89
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,070
Not to mention I said those harsh words earlier.

90
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,350
And you still...

91
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,480
It's okay, Jing Xin.

92
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,040
I know you care about me.

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,230
By the way, when we're alone,

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,790
don't call me Princess.

95
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,830
It sounds weird.

96
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,440
Just call me Tan

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,270
like you used to.

98
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Tan?

99
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,830
Like I used to?

100
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,670
Your previous life.

101
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm forever your Tan.

102
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,320
Come on, say it out loud.

103
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,600
We're sisters, forever and ever?

104
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,110
Tan.

105
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,670
No! No! No!

106
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,390
I should just call you Your Highness.

107
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,110
I really...

108
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,350
Stop it.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,550
Listen to me. No ifs or buts.

110
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,790
Don't get mad at me anymore, okay?

111
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,200
Yes.

112
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,110
Father.

113
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,480
The Bachelor School will start in three days.

114
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,230
All of you are to study there.

115
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,070
You represent the Mo family,

116
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,320
so watch your demeanor when school starts.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,230
Behave properly.

118
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,270
Yes.

119
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,760
Yes.

120
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,880
Both of you can leave now.

121
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,440
I have something to tell Lian Cheng.

122
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's go.

123
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,480
How are things going on the palace?

124
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,350
Her Majesty was trying to see

125
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,480
if I harbor ill will.

126
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,070
Perhaps she never trusted me.

127
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,880
It's not worth continuing further.

128
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,070
I see.

129
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,070
It seems like we can't proceed according to plan.

130
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,920
Be patient, Father.

131
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,070
It can be a blessing in disguise too.

132
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,790
You want to use the princess?

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
It's a possible route.

134
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,110
What she said yesterday leaves an opening for us.

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,030
You can rest assured, Father.

136
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,910
It is also my wish to free
the citizens from suffering.

137
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,230
Since it's my wish, I shall do my best.

138
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,880
Good.

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,880
(Jingyi Pavilion)
As per the royal decree,

140
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,350
the Bachelor School will start today.

141
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,760
You are expected to behave yourself

142
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,790
and be a good husband.

143
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,470
In your future marital life,

144
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,640
you are to bring forth offspring and to
work hard without complaining.

145
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,640
Please open the first page now, everyone.

146
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,350
Read every word carefully.

147
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
(What else should I do)

148
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,440
(to make Qu Tan Er ask for my hand?)

149
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,150
What are you writing, Eighth Young Master?

150
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,030
I am merely taking note of
what you said, Official Su.

151
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,910
Just a few scribbles. Nothing of concern.

152
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,880
So you're saying that you were
listening to the lecture

153
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,000
with that preoccupied expression of yours?

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,910
As per the royal decree,

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,670
the Bachelor School will start today.

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,150
You are expected to behave yourself
and be a good husband.

157
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,840
In your future marital life, you are to bring forth
offspring and to work hard without complaining.

158
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,840
If I remember it correctly,

159
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,030
Official Su shall continue your lecture.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,280
We're all eager to learn here.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,760
Good.

162
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,590
Read carefully.

163
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,180

166
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,350
Please study every word carefully.

167
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,520
I will come back and check after two hours.

168
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,030
Fourteenth, if you have trouble
understanding the lecture,

169
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
feel free to ask me.

170
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,350
I...

171
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,280
I knew you weren't paying attention.

172
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,590
Let's start with Humility.

173
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,030
The third day after the birth of a boy,

174
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,000
you should place the baby below the bed,

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
give him a potsherd with which to play,

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
announce his birth to his ancestors
by an offering.

177
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,760
To lay the baby below the bed

178
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,030
shows that you are lowly and weak,

179
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,880
which means you should be...

180
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,230
Intimate contact with another bachelor.

181
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,440
Sent an expensive gift to a bachelor.

182
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,880
Eighth Brother, who's this bachelor?

183
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,520
Eighth Brother, what are you planning?

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,960
They sound...

185
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Do not overthink this, Brother.

186
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,230
Princess is here!

187
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,030
Mo Lian Cheng.

188
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,280
Come out.

189
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,710
Eighth Brother...

190
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,790
(Fine then.)

191
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,080
(Now that you've done it in the public,)

192
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,320
(you'll have to marry me.)

193
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,470
What can I help you, Your Highness?

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,880
I know you must be tired from studying
so I came to cheer you up.

195
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,880
That's all?

196
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Yes.

197
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Well...

198
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,910
I came here to see you after class in person.

199
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,640
I even brought you some snacks.

200
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,880
Do you feel extra honored now?

201
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,790
Stay there!

202
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,790
I know the school starts today,

203
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,550
so I waited for the entire afternoon.

204
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,110
Is this your textbook?

205
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,710
Let me see what men

206
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,640
learn in this matriarchal Dongyue.

207
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,970
(Intimate contact with another bachelor.
Sent an expensive gift to a bachelor.)

208
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,380
(Peeking a bachelor.)

209
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,710
Aren't these what I did to you?

210
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,440
Your Highness kept disrespecting
the boundaries.

211
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,470
And now, my reputation is tarnished.

212
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,550
I'd like to know how Your Highness
will make it up for me?

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,550
So what I did to you

214
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,470
really bothers you then?

215
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,000
You want me to make it up for you.

216
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,230
So you want me to marry you?

217
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,710
What do you think, Your Highness?

218
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,110
Is this the real you, Cheng Cheng?

219
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,880
Who else do you think I am, Your Highness?

220
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,700
(Your Highness again? Seems like
he's not Cheng Cheng.)

221
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,840
(The eighth young master asked me to marry him.)

222
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,280
(If the real Cheng Cheng knows...)

223
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,760
Why? Are you reluctant to do so?

224
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,520
(Whatever. I just have to get this man first.)

225
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,550
Of course, I do.

226
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm very much

227
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,640
willing to so.

228
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,790
Read the next page.

229
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,500
(Three Orders and Three Rules)

230
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,640
Three Orders and Three Rules again?

231
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,400
How repetitive!

232
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,230
First order, no spilling secrets.

233
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,670
Second order, non-interference.

234
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,400
Third order, be honest.

235
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,910
Three Rules.

236
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,030
For daily interaction,

237
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,470
stay further than a one-arm distance.

238
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,280
For the bedroom,

239
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,840
a folding screen will be between us.

240
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,030
Lastly, no lovey-dovey

241
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,790
interaction.

242
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,230
Can you do them, Your Highness?

243
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,670
All see and no touch then?

244
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
Well...

245
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,910
No problem.

246
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,030
Shocked? Surprised?

247
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,880
As long as you marry me,

248
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,280
I'll agree to anything.

249
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,710
Do you really like me that much?

250
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,880
Of course!

251
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,080
A strong man is afraid of an obsessive woman.

252
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,760
What comes around goes around.

253
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm your karma.

254
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,440
In that case,

255
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,910
I shall visit you at night

256
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
to discuss our marriage at length.

257
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,470
Don't need to worry about dowry.

258
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,550
Just wait for the bridal carriage

259
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,200
like you're supposed to.

260
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,520
Jing Xin, does this look good on me?

261
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,030
Should I wear something lighter?

262
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,000
You look good in anything, Tan.

263
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,200
Really?

264
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
You don't look feminine enough.

265
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,520
What about...

266
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,800
Come.

267
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,590
I, the makeup guru, shall dress you up!

268
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
No thanks!

269
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,190
Come here!

270
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,680
Let's... not use this.

271
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,830
I'm going to give you

272
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,190
the most stylish hairstyle of the year.

273
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,830
Come on! Stay still.

274
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,680
Now you look cute.

275
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,520
Really?

276
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,640
Can't you knock, Cheng Cheng?

277
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,520
Make some noise at least.

278
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Are you trying to scare me to death?

279
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm meeting you at late night, Your Highness.

280
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,830
I cannot risk letting anyone know.

281
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,590
I'll take my leave.

282
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,070
Don't worry.

283
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,310
From now onwards,

284
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,800
as long as I'm here, no one can harm you.

285
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,590
After school, Her Majesty asked for my presence.

286
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,000
She was curious about the changes
in your personality

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,310
after the drowning incident.

288
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,310
Why are you staring at me?

289
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,000
What's so bad about the changes?

290
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,190
Isn't now much better?

291
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,160
Don't change the subject.

292
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,830
I think Her Majesty simply wished to see you.

293
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,800
You're a playboy!

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,430
It's fine that you attract other women,

295
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,400
but you attract an empress this time.

296
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,000
How am I supposed to win?

297
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,110
Such trouble!

298
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,400
Well, we can sever ties.

299
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,920
No!

300
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,590
That's not what I meant.

301
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,000
I meant to say that

302
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,160
you're as fine as wine

303
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,000
and...

304
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,000
and...

305
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
as dashing as the Prince Charming.

306
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,830
I do have literary talent.

307
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,430
(Look at how quick my reflexes are.)

308
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,640
(Every man)

309
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,110
(should learn from me.)

310
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,590
Since the empress is suspicious of you,

311
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,560
if you propose to marry me now,

312
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,110
it won't be easy.

313
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,710
I am the second princess of Dongyue.

314
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,430
I am allowed to marry whoever I want.

315
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,590
If you want me, then we need to work together.

316
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Sure.

317
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Mo Lian Cheng, you wish to file a complaint
against the second princess?

318
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,070
Yes.

319
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,230
When Her Highness was recuperating
in the Mo Residence,

320
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,590
she molested me and...

321
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,520
Dirtied my body and

322
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,470
reputation.

323
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,950
I demand a fair judgment, Your Majesty.

324
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,710
This is nothing but a seduction attempt from
Mo Lian Cheng since he wasn't chosen

325
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,710
during the harem selection.

326
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,350
It was just a ruse from him.

327
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,350
He wanted to blame everything on me,

328
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,830
so I have to marry him.

329
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,470
He is after the prince consort position.

330
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,070
You...

331
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,680
But several days ago,

332
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,710
you asked me to meet you outside of the school.

333
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,110
Everyone saw that.

334
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,800
What excuses can you make this time?

335
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,160
I...

336
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,680
(Oh, no! I forgot my line.)

337
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,640
Since the princess is not willing to admit it,

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,280
Your Majesty, I implore you to exact swift justice.

339
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,230
(Even though we skipped several parts)

340
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,160
(that we discussed earlier,)

341
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,640
(but I still remember this part.)

342
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
(I can follow up.)

343
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
You just want me to take responsibility, don't you?

344
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I know I've fallen for your trick.

345
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,070
Arrange a marriage then, Your Majesty.

346
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,230
We wouldn't want him to spout nonsense

347
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,350
and risk having Your Majesty's reputation
be tarnished.

348
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,400
Whether Mo Lian Cheng has planned
all these or not,

349
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,520
have you really done something intimate to him?

350
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,590
(We didn't anticipate this question at all.)

351
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,040
(I have no idea what she's trying to achieve.)

352
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,920
(How should I answer?)

353
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,350
It seems like

354
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,470
the princess still refuses to
bear the consequences.

355
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,160
I was first accused of seducing Your Majesty,

356
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,280
and now, my chastity was called into question
by the princess.

357
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,280
I see no place for me in this world,

358
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,350
perhaps...

359
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,520
Perhaps I should just commit suicide.

360
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,470
Stop!

361
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,590
Like I said, I'll marry you.

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,190
Look at this mess you've caused.

363
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,400
You have indeed dirtied him,

364
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
but marriage is no trivial matter.

365
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,000
I shall issue a decree

366
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,070
to announce that the second princess
is free to choose her own spouse.

367
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,710
(That's a trap!)

368
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,190
(If I pick Mo Lian Cheng,)

369
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,920
(it means I really like him.)

370
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,070
(So this show we put up will be in vain.)

371
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,000
(What a pro! A cunning pro.)

372
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,190
Dismiss.

374
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,310
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

375
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,350
Let's see who she'll pick.

376
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,880
Everyone knows that the second princess
and Chen Er love each other.

377
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,350
If she didn't pick you,

378
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,800
wouldn't your plan be in vain?

379
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,160
You don't need to worry, Father.

380
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,230
The eldest brother seems to be upset
when learning this news.

381
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,680
Indeed. He is ready to get married,

382
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,520
but the second princess never requested
Her Majesty to arrange a marriage.

383
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,830
Instead, she is now asked to select her own spouse.

384
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,710
Of course, Chen Er will be upset.

385
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,000
What the second princess said might hold true,

386
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,560
but her disrespectful disposition will only do

387
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,190
more harm than good to my eldest brother.

388
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,590
But I know he is

389
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,160
loving the second princess

390
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,710
with his soul and heart.

391
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,880
They have feelings for each other since young.

392
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,230
If the second princess did not choose Chen Er,

393
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,590
I'm afraid he'd spend

394
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,350
the rest of his life as a monk.

395
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,280
Don't worry, Father.

396
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,310
I will not make things difficult for him.

397
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,710
Nice move.

398
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,560
Your Go skills have improved.

399
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,110
But Tan,

400
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,310
are you really going to pick the eighth
young master as your husband?

401
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,310
I believe that the eldest brother
is the best candidate.

402
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,950
You won't understand this, Jing Xin.

403
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,880
Love is a merciless one-way street.

404
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,280
On this street,

405
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,070
I see only Mo Lian Cheng.

406
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,190
Mo Yan Chen is a sweet guy,

407
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,190
but he's not what I want.

408
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,520
Let's go.

409
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,710
Cheng Cheng!

410
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,950
All right. One-arm distance.

411
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,400
Everyone else, please wait outside.

412
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,280
I want to have a private moment with him.

413
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,070
Your Highness seems to have noticed that

414
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,560
the decree of Her Majesty hides
an ulterior motive.

415
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So what?

416
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,190
I will still pick you.

417
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,880
What is she going to do? back out?

418
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,680
An empress will never renege on her promise.

419
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,070
However, more troubles might come in the future.

420
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,040
So you want to call everything off?

421
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,280
Are you regretting your decision now,
Mo Lian Cheng?

422
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,190
I have a strategy

423
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,190
to solve our current predicament.

424
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,920
Would you like to hear it, Your Highness?

425
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:18,920
Speak.

426
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,760
As long as you can be my husband,

427
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,920
if you ask for the stars, I'll never give you the moon.

428
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,190
Then marry my eldest brother too.

429
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,800
What?

430
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Are you crazy or did I mishear?

431
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,880
This sounds ridiculous!

432
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,950
You did not mishear me.

433
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
If you wish to marry me,

434
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,400
you'd need to marry my eldest brother too.

435
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,520
He's so going to regret this when he
got his memory back.

436
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,230
He might even kill himself.

437
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,160
I refuse. You will regret this.

438
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,110
I am a man of his word.

439
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,710
(As expected from a nutjob.)

440
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,350
(I know his craziness is incurable,)

441
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,820
(but I still need to do something.)

442
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,880
(Or else, when he turns into the real Cheng Cheng,)

443
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
(he'll not need to wait for lightning to strike him.)

444
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,560
(He can just kill himself.)

445
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,520
Nothing in this world

446
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,560
can escape from this axiom:

447
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,070
What a tsundere says will always backfire.

448
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,230
When you install a flagpole,
it will eventually fall.

449
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,880
Today, you give me your word.

450
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,950
Tomorrow, you'll wish to take them back.

451
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,190
If Your Highness is reluctant to do so,

452
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,110
then let's nullify our previous agreement.

453
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,040
We are strangers now.

454
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,000
I did this for you, okay?

455
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,560
Can't you see it?

456
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,800
And your final decision is...?

457
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,350
I'll count to three.

458
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,000
One, two,

459
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,160
three.

460
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,710
Fine.

461
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,920
Karma will come back and bite you.

462
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,110
Don't blame me when the time comes.

463
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,760
Deal!

464
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,350
Such decisiveness, Your Highness.

465
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,000
I believe we'll form a great team.

466
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,800
Mo Yan Chen is handsome.

467
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,110
If I ever fall for him,

468
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,310
don't you regret it.

469
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,520
Whoever regrets first is a dummy!

470
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,310
Promised.

471
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,470
Whoever regrets first

472
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,160
is a... dummy.

473
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,140
(Congji Hall)

474
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

475
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,520
Yan Chen.

476
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,280
You're the most considerate one
in the Mo family.

477
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,710
I'd like to arrange for you to be married
to the second princess.

478
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,110
What do you think?

479
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

480
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,800
I shall devote my life to the second princess

481
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,520
and shoulder her burden.

482
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,880
I've also decided that

483
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,920
Lian Cheng will be wed to her too.

484
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,950
Both of you can look after each other
and also the household.

485
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,760
(I suppose this is)

486
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,950
(to cease Lian Cheng's obsession
towards Her Majesty.)

487
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
(I'm fine with it,)

488
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,920
(but Tan Er took the short end of the stick.)

489
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,280
As you wish, Your Majesty.

490
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,950
(I'm surrounded by two men.)

491
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,000
(Why does it feel like)

492
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,710
(I have peaked?)

493
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,430
(Seems like it's all thanks to Mo Lian Cheng.)

494
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,110
(Might as well enjoy it.)

495
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Both the prince and the eighth lord
bear the same intention,\.

496
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,760
What do you think?

497
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,160
(What's happening?)

498
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,470
Why aren't you taking my decree, Mo Lian Cheng?

499
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,800
(Tan Er! How dare you marry Mo Yan Chen!)

500
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
Marriage is no trivial matter.

501
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,430
Only if you follow your heart that
everything will end well.

502
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,310
I implore Your Majesty and Your Highness
to think twice.

503
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,230
(Mo Lian Cheng!)

504
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,760
(Why are you playing hard-to-get
all of a sudden?)

505
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,310
Once issued, the royal decree cannot be revoked.

506
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,560
(Oh, no! He's still in love with the empress.)

507
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,040
(If this carries on, it will end badly.)

508
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,830
I shall work with my eighth brother
to serve the princess,

509
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
to be the princess's right-hand men.

510
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,430
Now that this is settled.

511
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,400
Who should be the first husband?

512
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,680
(The empress is still trying to gauge
our reaction until now.)

513
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,110
(Now that we're here, might as well
go with her wishes.)

514
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,590
My brother is the eldest son.

515
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,640
He should be the first husband.

516
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,110
Tan Er.

517
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,400
What do you think?

518
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,230
(Mo Lian Cheng as my second husband?)

519
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,680
(Sounds exciting.)

520
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,520
As you wish, Your Majesty.

521
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,800
(Seems like Tan Er loves me after all.)

522
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,400
In this case,

523
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,590
proceed as you wish.

524
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

525
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I can't believe

526
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,230
I get to enjoy two husbands one day.

527
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,880
Never see this coming.

528
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,590
Indeed.

529
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,110
A decade-long dream has finally come true.

530
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,470
Thank heaven!

531
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,430
Tan Er, I...

532
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,800
Tan Er?

533
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,400
Eighth Brother?

534
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,190
What?

535
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,800
You're my second husband and now
you can't wait to exert dominance?

536
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,520
In the great hall,

537
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,430
I said only if you followed your heart that
everything would end well.

538
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,160
Did you not get what I said?

539
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,520
You churn out different drama every day.

540
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,560
Who knows what's in your mind?

541
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,230
Do you think I'd joke with my heart?

542
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,470
I once said that whoever we are,

543
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,110
regardless of the time and the distance,

544
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,760
I will find you, love you,

545
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,310
and marry you a thousand times.

546
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,830
Never separate in an eternity.

547
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Cheng Cheng!

548
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:51,300
♪Yet I still bet with this life♪

549
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,480
♪This longing, this pining♪
