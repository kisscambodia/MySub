May I ask when Mr. Lin will arrive?

please come in later and ask us.

Is it OK?

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,919
What happened to Lin Xiangyuan?

26
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,600
It is so late.

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,520
Dad. Let's go inside.

28
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,440
Whatever happens,

29
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,199
it shouldn't be you to wait for him.

Good Morning, Mr. Lin.
(566 Zhongshan South Road)

Mr. Lin, we have to hurry up.

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,479
There was a call from
the press conference.

33
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,679
Mr. Jiang is already there.

34
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,199
Is he? He is really free.

35
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,800
Then let him wait.

36
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,639
Sure. You're busy with work.

37
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,399
It's reasonable

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,080
to be a little bit late.

39

-Mr. Lin.
-Mr. Lin.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,919
Mr. Lin, may I ask you a few questions?

41
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,240
Hello, Mr. Lin.

42
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,320
What do you think of

43
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
the press conference today?

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,639
Mr. Lin, may I ask about

45
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,039
your comments
on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

46
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,919
-Tell us please.
-Tell us please.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
You were entrusted with the mission
at a critical moment,

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,399
and you brought the company
an investment.

49
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,440
How did you make it?

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
What's wrong with these journalists?

51
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,080
Dad,

52
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,759
you are the one who was entrusted

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,919
and also who steered Yutian.

54
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,479
Why is everyone focusing on him?

55
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,960
Actually about these questions,

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,440
you should ask Mr. Jiang.

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,800
At the critical moment,

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
if it wasn't Mr. Jiang
who saved the critical situation,

59
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,679
there may not be this press conference.

60
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:45,320
Never mind.
Xiangyuan has also done a lot.

61
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,720
For young man as he is,

62
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,720
it's ok to show himself off
a little bit.

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,839
Mr. Jiang is not only my teacher,

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
but also my leader.

65
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,040
I owe everything I've done

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,559
to Mr. Jiang for his

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,079
help and support behind the scenes.

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
So, thanks to Mr. Jiang,

69
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,040
I can achieve success today.

70
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,359
Mr. Lin, can I ask you another question?

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,000
For further questions,

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,399
let's go inside and ask,
shall we?

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,239
Ok. Excuse me.

Bro,

78
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,440
you have to watch
even if you don't want to.

This is the rule in the prison.

this is the first press conference
of Yutian Group

86
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
after the imprisonment
of the former president, Lei Yuzheng.

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,119
Is it him?

88
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,760
Yes!

89
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,440
You don't look like that.

90
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,880
But I've been proven right.

91
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,320
I know you're not common.

92
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,200
So what?

93
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:13,200
Nobody is common in this room.

94
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
…Now he is in jail with us.

95
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,799
First of all, thank you all

96
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,279
for coming here. Today…

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,640
I guess,

98
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,959
your imprisonment

99
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,119
just gave this man a chance, right?

100
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,040
Make or break.

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,720
You can't blame others.

102
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,559
After the Entertainment Center project
is completed,

103
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,480
there will be

104
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
a more grand celebration.

105
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm full of confidence about it.

106

The Entertainment Center project

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,640

along the way.

109
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,040
Thus, on behalf of Yutian Group,

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,839
I'd like to express my deep gratitude

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,119
to everyone
who has contributed to this project.

112
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,959
Dad.

113
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,440
I still remember

114
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,600
when Yuzheng signed with S.G.,

115
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,559
it was also like this.

116
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,119
There was
a spectacular press conference.

117
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,559
Probably you have forgot.

118
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,119
But I haven't.

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
The person standing here
to give the speech

120
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,839
shouldn't be Lin Xiangyuan.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,399
It should be Yuzheng.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,440
Yuzheng is a good boy.

123
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,679
It's just...What a pity.

124
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,000
Fine. Forget it.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
My little girl.

126
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not blaming you.

127
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:44,519
But since you're already engaged with
Lin Xiangyuan,

128
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,600
you shouldn't think about Lei Yuzheng
all the time.

129
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,839
What if Lin Xiangyuan is aware of this…

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,679
Dad,

131
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,359
I regret it.

132
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,000
At last.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,559
What?

134
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,440
Please allow me to thank...

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,559
What's wrong, Fanlv?

136
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,839
Nothing. I just feel something wrong
with my stomach.

137
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,040
…It's my teacher,

138
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,440
Mr. Jiang Jin.

139
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,880
He turns out to be a rich person.

140
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,119
So what?

141
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,600
He is still imprisoned here

142
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,119
like us.

143
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,200
Come on.
Let me have an interview with you.

144
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,320
Talk about how you feel now.

145
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,480
-Yes. Tell us.
-Tell us.

00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,399
What are you doing?

147

Wanna a fight?

148
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,959
If I don't know you're rich,

149
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,519
I will let it go.

150
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,559
Since I know that now,

151
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,880
I'll beat you up.

152
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,760
Yuzheng, what are you doing?

153
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,959
Don't bother.

154
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
There are guards at the door.

155
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,519
You are not content with that!

156
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,640
Not content!

157
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,119
What are you doing?

158
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,119
What's going on here?

What's wrong with you?

163
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,599
Siyang, are you ok?

164
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,479
What happened?

165
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,919
He had a heart attack.

166
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,719
Please call the doctor!

167
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,880
Call the doctor!

168
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,400
Open all the windows.

169
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,320
Ventilate the room.

170

Siyang, come on.

171
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,479
Is he pretending?

172
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,320
Isn't he?

It's real.

175
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,200
It's all right.

176
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,679
Breathe in through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

Miss Jiang,

185

you don't look well.

00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,359
I'm fine.

188
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,300
(Qingpu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital,
Fudan University)

189
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,479
-Qunfei.
-Yes?

190
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,960
You said that
Yutian has a press conference today?

191
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Why don't you go there?

192
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,919
For what?

193
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,799
I am just nobody now.

194
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,919
It doesn't matter whether I go or not.

195
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,400
Besides,

196
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,479
I can't stand the showy look

197
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,719
of Lin Xiangyuan.

198
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,119
I'm afraid I'll punch him if I go there.

199
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,239
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Xiaosu,

201
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,799
Mr. Lei's hand just moved!

202
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Look!

203
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,599
It's really moving!

204
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,479
Doctor! Doctor!

205
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,440
Doctor.

206
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,359
Mr. Lei just moved his hand.

207
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,559
Mr. Lei.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
He's awake! Mr. Lei is awake!

209
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,559
Great！

210
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,320
Fanlv, how are you doing?

211
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,799
Are you still not feeling good?

212
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm fine. Much better.

213
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,559
Dad, I have something to deal with.
I've got to go.

214
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,159
Ok.

215
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,760
Why is she distracted?

216
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,479
Mr. Lin.

217
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,840
Mr. Jiang,

218
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,880
I'll go to the construction site
with Mr. Xie.

219
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,280
Are you coming with us?

220
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,400
You go ahead.

221
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,640
I've been sitting all day,

222
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,479
and I've really got some backache.

223
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm old and useless.

224
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,280
Come on.

225
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,000
You're vigorous.

226
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,559
Let me drive you home.

227
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,719
As a man,

228
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,320
you shall not nag me!

229
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,080
Business comes first.

230
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,239
Ok, take care.

231
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:54,416
(Press Conference)

232
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,799
Mr. Lin, let's go.

233
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,440
Mr. Lin.

234
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,840
The Entertainment Center project is
in great demand for money.

235
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
A hundred million is just gone
in the blink of an eye.

236
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,919
How much more money is expected?

237
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,679
There is nothing to expect.

238
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,919
You mean...

239
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,520
Not even a penny.

240
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,799
Yutian has other projects
other than the Entertainment Center.

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,039
Just put the Entertainment Center
project aside.

242
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,760
By the way,

243
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,280
what's wrong with Miss Jiang just now?

244
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,599
I just saw her vomit.

245
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:36,840
Vomit?

246
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,559
Keep an eye on her these days.

247
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,760
No matter what happens,

248
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
you must let me know.

249
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,359
Ok.

250
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:42,479
Ok.

251
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,599
I'm telling you two that

252
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
the patient is incapable now

253
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,039
and can't express himself.

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,760
So, there must be someone
with him every minute.

255
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,239
Otherwise,

256
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,960
there will be problems.

257
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:56,880
Thank you.

258
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,039
Please leave.

259
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,119
Back off!

260
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,719
Bad guy.

261
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,479
Excuse me. Excuse me.

262
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,559
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,719
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,919
Mr. Lei.

265
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,320
Bad guy.

266
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,679
Excuse me. Excuse me.

267
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,039
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

268
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,200
Mr. Lei,

269
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,760
you can't talk like this.

270
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,479
You're bad, too. Back off!

271
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,440
Ask bad guys to leave! Leave!

272
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,760
Fine, fine, fine.

273
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,280
Well, he is leaving right now.

274
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
He is leaving right now.

275
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,239
Mr. Lei, you're right.

276
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm the bad guy.

277
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,520
Scold me.

278
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,799
He Qunfei, stop blaming yourself.

279
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,919
This is
the sequelae of cerebral hemorrhage.

280
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,799
He has no idea what he is talking about.

281
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,039
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

282
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,039
Xiaosu,

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,760
if Mr. Lei didn't wake up,

284
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,599
how could I explain to his son?

285
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,400
We were worried that

286
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,039
he could not wake up before.

287
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,719
But he's awake now.

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,960
So, we should be more confident now.

289
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,799
As long as he's not well,

290
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,400
we'll take care of him.

291
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I believe that

292
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,559
he is gonna be fine one day.

293
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,880
Mr. Lei,

294
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,840
let's go home.

295
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,960
Here we go. Let's go home.

296
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,080
(Civilized Prison Cell)

297
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
Why are you back?

298
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,400
Why? You don't know me?

299
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,400
Are you fine?

300
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,119
Don't worry.

301
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm a cat

302
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,280
with nine lives, and I can't just die.

303
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,520
Come over here. Have a seat.

304
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,280
Did you do it on purpose that day?

305
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,039
On purpose?

306
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,320
Are you pretending to be sick,

307
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,479
as you are afraid
I'm gonna get punished?

308
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,799
My heart

309
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,799
has problems.

310
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,039
If it was not you that day,

311
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,200
I would be gone.

312
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,760
Why? Wanna change your career?

313
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,679
Don't wanna be a boss any more?

314
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,719
Wanna take a job in finance?

315
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,640
Just take a look.

316
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,559
It seems like

317
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,919
you've also studied abroad.

318
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,679
Stanford Graduate School of Business.

319
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,919
That explains.

320
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,479
Your father is very far-sighted.

321
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,679
For such a large Group like Yutian,

322
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
there has to be someone to take over.

323
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,520
I failed them.

324
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
You can't put it this way.

325
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,760
You're not the only one to stumble
in the business world.

326
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,159
After I

327
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
graduated from Lancaster University
in the UK,

328
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,159
I joined

329
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,840
BlackRock in the UK.

330
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,320
In those years,

331
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,840
I was getting too arrogant.

332
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,039
See. This is where I am.

333
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,000
I haven't even asked you.

334
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,880
What's the reason?

335
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,799
Do you know
the Minsheng Road in Shanghai?

336
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,039
I

337
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,200
was the chief trader

338
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,479
in one of the fund management companies.

339
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,640
I don't need to tell you

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,799
the rest.

341
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,719
I don't get it.

342
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm just like you.

343
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,440
Didn't you take all
the responsibilities on your own?

344
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,280
How do you know that?

345
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840
Come out. It's time for exercise.

346
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,479
We have plenty of time. Take your time.

347
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,719
Mr. Lin, do you really wanna go there?

348
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,359
We should come sooner or later.

349
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,719
Since Lei Ting has been discharged
from the hospital,

350
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,560
we should come to see him.

351
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
He was the president of Yutian
after all.

352
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,079
Besides,

353
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,239
the one I hate is Lei Yuzheng,

354
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,680
not Lei Ting.

355
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:11,760
Let's go.

356
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,599
Mr. Lei.

357
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,520
Mr. Lei.

358
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Guys.

359
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,680
Hello, uncle Duan.

360
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,920
This is our regard.

361
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,040
So sorry to cost you.
(Luxury Gifts)

362
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:52,920
Thank you.

363
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,199
Not at all.

364
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,119
Mr. Lei is taking a nap.

365
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,400
He was here to get some sun, well...

366
00:18:58,959 --> 00:18:59,920
He's awake.

367
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,680
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

368
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,040
I'll make you some tea.

369
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,920
Go ahead.

370
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,119
Mr. Lei, I'm Lin Xiangyuan.

371
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,719
Do you still remember?

372
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,640
Mr. Lei,

373
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,520
it seems you've recovered pretty well.

374
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,199
Great. That's great.

375
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,920
Then we can set our mind at rest.

376
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,479
Right, Mr. Lei.

377
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,959
Mr. Lin is very concerned about you.

378
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,479
As soon as he heard that
you were discharged,

379
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,920
he left his work

380
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,319
and came to see you.

381
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,199
Bad guys.

382
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,599
Mr. Lei, you're so good at joking.

383
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,319
We all work for you.

384
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,719
How can we be bad guys?

385
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,920
That's right.

386
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,920
Bad guys. Bad guys.

387
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,680
Back off! Back off!

388
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,719
Mr. Lin,
is Lei Ting really out of his mind?

389
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,079
Look at him.

390
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,119
He wants to eat us alive!

391
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,599
Mr. Lei,

392
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,800
don't you remember who I am?

393
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm Lei Yuzheng's colleague.

394
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,199
Yuzheng?

395
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,680
Right. Where is Yuzheng?

396
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,439
Where is Yuzheng?

397
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,280
Bad guy. Give Yuzheng back to me!

398
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,439
I'll kill you! Kill you!

399
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,280
Mr. Lin.

400
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,760
Back off!

401
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,640
Let's go.

402
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,319
Back off!

403
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,719
Or I'm gonna shoot!

404
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,439
Mr. Lei, calm down.

405
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,880
Can we take it easy?

406
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,199
Back off! Or I'll shoot!

407
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,119
Mr. Lei,

408
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,800
you wanna hit people with the stick?

409
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
All of you are bad guys! Bad guys!

410
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,760
Please don't. Give it to me.

411
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,280
What's going on?

412
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,199
Excuse me.

413
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,079
Mr. Lei suffered a bad illness.

414
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,400
He hasn't recovered yet.
He's still confused.

415
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Are you hurt?

416
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,640
It's fine. It's fine.

417
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,079
Yuzheng, they are all bad guys.

418
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,439
They're guests.

419
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,880
You're bad, too.

420
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,719
Bad guy. Back off!

421
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,199
Look!

422
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,079
Back off! All of you!

423
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,160
Good lord.

424
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,839
He's yelling at everyone like this now?

425
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,520
He's out of his mind sometimes.

426
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Let's make it another day, shall we?

427
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,199
Fine.

428
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,479
Ask them to leave!

429
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,479
They 're gone.

430
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,920
Excuse me.

431
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,800
What's that about?

432
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,079
It's bloody hell out of luck.

433
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,359
Got beaten for nothing.

434
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,680
He is out of your mind, isn't he?

435
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Why is it so easy for him to get angry?

436
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,280
Never mind.

437
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
There is no need
to take offence at a patient.

438
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,199
Let him take it out.

439
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,719
Just consider it as

440
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,160
an apology I make to him.

441
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,040
Now Lei Yuzheng is in jail.

442
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,280
He is so sick.

443
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,479
Yutian shall count on me.

444
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,880
That's true.

445
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,920
You're the manager
of Yutian from now on.

446
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,079
You forgot about Jiang Jin and others.

447
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,880
Mr. Jiang is your future father-in-law.

448
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,800
He must be on your side.

449
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,479
Miss Jiang, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

450
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Pregnant?

451
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,439
How could that happen?

452
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,839
Are you making a mistake?

453
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,040
Look at the report.

454
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,640
Don't worry. It's already
one month and a half.

Fanlv.

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,520
Why are you so grief when you see me.

462
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,119
Is it because I'm getting old?

463
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,719
I just didn't expect that

464
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,040
we would meet here.

465
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,479
Look at you now.

466
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,479
I feel very sorry.

467
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,239
Don't worry. I'm great.

468
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:45,199
If only
we could go back to our childhood.

469
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,839
I still remember that

470
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,079
lemon soda was your favourite drink.

471
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:55,640
You liked to make fun of girls
with caterpillars.

472
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,839
You also liked to defend Zhenrong.

473
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,439
We were carefree at that time.

474
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,520
We used to be together every day.

475
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,040
How wonderful it was!

476
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,719
This is fate.

477
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,479
You're too young for believing in fate.

478
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,880
Don't you think so?

479
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,239
I don' t believe in fate.

480
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,359
I am used to
making fate submitted to me.

481
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,719
But I've gradually realized that

482
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,599
fate will always give you a blow

483
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,040
out of surprise,

484
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,959
so that you'll know that
your previous ambitions

485
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,400
were just a joke.

486
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,920
Fanlv, remember that,

487
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,160
no matter when,

488
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm your family.

489
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,920
I know.

490
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I didn't want you to treat me
like a sister before.

491
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,040
Now I've realized

492
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,640
how much I rely on you.

493
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,880
As long as you're around,

494
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,199
no matter what serious things happen,

495
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,640
I won't be scared.

496
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,520
Now I've grown up.

497
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,680
Now that I've made my decision,

498
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,760
I have to face it on my own.

499
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,439
I just came to see you.

500
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,719
As long as I see you,

501
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,479
I'll feel peace.

502
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,560
Fanlv.

503
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,239
Tell me.

504
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,119
Is there anything wrong?

505
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,359
Yuzheng, stop asking.

506
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,719
You're right.

507
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,839
Some things are meant to be happening.

508
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,800
Yuzheng,

509
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,920
don't worry.

510
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,199
No matter what happened,

511
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,479
no matter what I did,

512
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll be good.

513
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,599
I'll wait for you to come out.

514
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,839
Take good care of yourself.

515
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,280

516
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,760
I wish you are happy.

517
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,119
I will.

518
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,560
Don't worry about me.

520
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,640

522
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:38,800

525
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,599

Why don't you tell me earlier?

531
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,319
Yes! Yes! Yes!

532
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,640
I can be a father!

533
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm a father! Yes!

Mr. Lin,

537
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,520
miss Jiang is going to see
the obstetrics doctor tomorrow.

538
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,160
Ok.

539
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,920
Help me decline the work tomorrow.

540
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,920
I'll go with her.

541
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,839

542

She called the doctor for abortion.

Abortion?

544
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,119
That is my child!

545
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,119
It's my family's blood.

546
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,439
How dare she?

547
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,719
You're right.

555
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,479
you said this was pretty tasty.

556

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,439
Come over here.

559
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,359
Put them away.

560
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,079
Xiangyuan. You're too considerate.

561
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,520
I just said it,

562
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,160
you keep it in your mind.

563
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
What's wrong?

564
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,800
Mr. Jiang. Please don't tell Fanlv

565
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,280
those are from me.

566
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,520
Otherwise she'll lose her appetite.

567
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,160
That's who she is.

568
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,199
Don't mind her words.

569
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,400
Come here. Have a seat.

570
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,800
Mr. Jiang.
Fanlv went to visit Lei Yuzheng.

571
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,800
Fanlv and Lei Yuzheng

572
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,920
grew up playing together.

573
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,400
It's natural to go to see him.

574
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,319
Mr. Jiang. You misunderstood me.

575
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,680
I'm just a little worried.

576
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,920
Although we are engaged,

577
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,959
but we're still not one family.

578
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,800
I'm afraid I'm wasting her time.

579
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,160
To be honest,

580
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,880
even if Fanlv regrets it,

581
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,680
I have no complaints.

582
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:36,839
I just hope

583
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,040
she can find someone
who really loves her,

584
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,520
not for someone
who doesn't deserve her love.

585
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,920
She can't waste her time.

586
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,719
You're right.

587
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,439
It seems
as long as you're not married,

588
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,959
Fanlv's mind

589
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,760
won't settle.

590
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,319
How about this?

591
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,760
You prepare whatever you need.

592
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,040
I'll talk to Fanlv later.

593
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,959
Hurry up with your marriage.

594
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
Yes, Mr. Jiang, thank you.

595
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,680
I gotta go.

596
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,599
(Civilized Prison Cell)

597
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,000
Lei Yuzheng.

598
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,079
Get ready. Go to the reception room.

599
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,599
I don't wanna meet her.

600
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,319
Ok.

601
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,439
That girl is here.
You still don't see her.

602
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,800
Not willing?

603
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,280
I can't.

604
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,359
Why? Are you afraid you can't
hold on yourself if you meet her?

605
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,400
Look at yourself.

606
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,040
If I meet her one time,
she will come for another time.

607
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,119
So I can't meet her.

608
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,920
In my opinion,
that girl is pretty determined.

609
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,079
If you do like this,

610
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,839
I'm afraid she won't give it up.

611
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,880
Then find a way to make her give up.

612
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,560
People like me

613
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,719
have to be cruel.

614
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
That's being responsible for others.

615
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,160
What's the girl's name again?

616
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,719
Du Xiaosu.

617
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,079
Du Xiaosu.

618
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,520
Du Xiaosu.

619
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,239
Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,400
You are not cruel at all.

621
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,000
You love her deeply.

622
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,199
It really freaked me out

623
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,920
to take the flight of over ten hours.

624
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,920
Mrs. Shao. Look at you.

625
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:25,599
Going abroad to recover really works.

626
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,560
You look much better
and are in a good mood.

627
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,439
What can I do?

628
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,040
Zhenrong has been gone
for more than one year.

629
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,920
I wanna be with him.
But the God doesn't allow me.

630
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,719
There is no way out.
I have to live a few more years.

631
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,680
Mrs. Shao. What are you talking about?

632
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,560
Fine. Forget it.

633
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,439
Could you please sort out the presents?

634
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,319
The nutrients are for Mr. Lei.

635
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,280
What happened to you?

636
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,079
Mrs. Shao. You have no idea.

637
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,640
When you're not around,

638
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,119
there was something wrong
with Lei's family.

639
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,359
We had a deal, right?

640
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,839
If you take the medicine seriously,

641
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,079
you'll get better soon.

642
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,800
You shall take the medicine.

643
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,359
Mr. Lei. I'm coming.

644
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,400
Look.

645
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,040
Guess what I've brought to you.

646
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,920
Marshmallow.

647
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,040
Ok. Let's do this.

648
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,800
One bite of medicine.

649
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,199
One bite of marshmallow.

650
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,119
Come on.

651
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,479
Come on.

652
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,839
Take it slow.

653
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,359
Great.

654
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,520
Take the marshmallow.
Take the marshmallow.

655
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,319
Actually

656
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,680
There is no other way to coax him.

657
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,439
Just treat him like a kid.

658
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,280
Coax while persuading.

659
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,520
It depends on who it is.

660
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,560
Last time there were two guests.

661
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:52,280
Coax while persuading. It didn't work.

662
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,920
Mr. Lei kicked them out with the stick.

663
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,040
Who are they?

664
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,400
The last name of the boss is Lin.

665
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,880
It's said to be Yuzheng's colleagues,

666
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,680
who specially came to see him.

667
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,959
Lin Xiangyuan?

668
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,160
It seems to be like him.

669
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,959
Du Xiaosu. What are you doing here?

670
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
Aunt Shao.

671
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,280
Why don't you come in first?

672
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,160
I'll explain to you later.

673
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,560
Mr. Lei. What's wrong?

674
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,199
You have marshmallow on your lips.

675
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,239
Like a Santa Claus.

676
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,719
Let's take it off.

677
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,280
Done.

678
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,280
What did you just call me?

679
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,919
Marshmallow.

680
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Fine. Whatever you want.

681
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,639
As long as you're happy with it.

682
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,360
Marshmallow. Marshmallow.

683
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,520
Fine.

684
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,399
Mr. Lei. How about this?

685
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,399
As long as you're well behaved
in eating and sleeping,

686
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,879
every time I come to see you,

687
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,439
I'll bring you the marshmallow.

688
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,919
Fine. I promise.

689
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Lei, this is Kaixuan.

690
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,239
Who is Kaixuan?

691
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:25,080
Mr. Lei. She's a friend.

692
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,520
Kaixuan is your friend.

693
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,320
A good friend.

694
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,560
A good friend.

695
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,000
He's confused again.

696
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,239
Aunt Shao, don't be sad.

697
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:44,439
The doctor said

698
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,879
This is the sequela of
cerebral hemorrhage.

699
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,199
It'll get better in a while.

700
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,120
All we need to do is
to take good care of him.

701
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,760
You've been taking care of him recently?

702
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,560
Mrs. Shao. You have no idea.

703
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,239
Thanks to Miss Du,

704
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:01,040
she has been coming all the time to
take care of Mr. Lei.

705
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:02,479
Though Mr. Lei is

706
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:03,639
confused sometimes,

707
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,280
who is the good guy or bad guy,

708
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,879
he knows it.

709
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
Dont' you, Mr. Lei?

710
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,479
Marshmallow, good guy.

711
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:12,479
See?

712
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Mr. Lei. How about this?

713
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,760
Let me talk with Aunt Shao.

714
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Uncle Duan will take a walk with you
and get some sun.

715
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,479
Ok.

716
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:25,959
Fine.

717
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:26,679
Ok?

718
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,320
Great!

719
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,840
Let' go. Slow down.

720
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,959
I'll leave you alone.

721
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,360
Mr. Lei is just like a child.

722
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,879
As long as you spend more time with him
and talk to him,

723
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,360
he'll be happy.

724
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,399
Have you ever thought about it?

725
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
After he is recovered,

726
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,520
how are you going to
explain about Yuzheng to him?

727
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:02,760
I think...

728
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,959
I can't even think about it now.

729
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,399
Take one day at a time.

730
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,239
Aunt Shao. I didn't expect

731
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,719
we could talk like this.

732
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,760
It's all the past.

733
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Thank you for helping Yuzheng
in the difficult time.

734
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:32,080
Lei Yuzheng offered me a lot of help.

735
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,560
He's in trouble now. I feel responsible.

736
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,479
There is one thing.

737
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,080
I hope you can do me a favor.

738
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,399
Lei Yuzheng is very stubborn.

739
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,639
He's in such a big trouble now.

740
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,000
He certainly doesn't need
the pity from others,

741
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,360
and doesn't want to get others
in trouble.

742
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,320
So he doesn't wanna see me right now.

743
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,919
But I know,

744
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,760
what he is most worried about
is his father.

745
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,879
If you visit him next time,

746
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,120
please help me take this picture to him.

747
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,840
Thank you.

748
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:16,280
Don't say that. That's what I should do.

749
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,919
Mrs. Have you really made up your mind

750
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,719
to give up this baby?

751
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,159
If you haven't figured it out,

752
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,080
then calm down and think about it.

753
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,000
Generally speaking,

754
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
we don't suggest
to give up the first baby.

755
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,479
If you can keep it, keep it.

756
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,639
No. I've made up my mind.

757
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,239
Lin Xiangyuan. You are following me!

758
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,439
Fanlv.

759
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,320
I am concerned.
You've suffered from vomiting recently.

760
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,320
I'm begging you.

761
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,679
Could you please keep the baby?

762
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,239
This baby is ours after all.

763
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,560
I'm his father.

764
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,479
In any case,

765
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,760
you should discuss with me.

766
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,000
Yes, you're the father of the baby.

767
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,520
But you know that

768
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,239
it's not the right time for this baby.

769
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,879
I know.

770
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,840
This baby is not our plan.

771
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,520
You're not prepared yet.

772
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,239
No matter how much you hate me

773
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,199
or be mad at me,

774
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,439
We're the parents of this baby.

775
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,479
The baby is innocent.

776
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,439
I'm begging you.

777
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,560
Could you please keep this baby?

778
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,120
I know you're very angry.

779
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,199
I swear.

780
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,439
No matter what you wanna do to me,

781
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,959
I promise
I won't fight back or swear back.

782
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,000
Even if you ask me to disappear,

783
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I'll be fine.

784
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,159
As long as you keep this baby.

785
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,560
Fanlv. I shouldn't be with you,

786
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,159
knowing that you don't love me.

787
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:47,959
I promise you.

788
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,239
I can disappear from your life.

789
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
I...tomorrow...

790
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,760
No. I will...at once...

791
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,479
I will resign at once,

792
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:59,399
leave the company and the city.

793
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,280
But if you can give birth to this baby,

794
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,199
I'll try all my best to love him

795
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:07,800
and protect him.

796
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,679
As long as he can stay,

797
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,320
it'll be enough for me.

798
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,800
I swear.

799
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,600
Wait a minute.
