May I ask when Mr. Lin will arrive?

on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

If you have any questions,
please come in later and ask us.

Is it OK?

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,919
What happened to Lin Xiangyuan?

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,600
It is so late.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,520
Dad. Let's go inside.

28
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,440
Whatever happens,

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,199
it shouldn't be you to wait for him.

Good Morning, Mr. Lin.
(566 Zhongshan South Road)

31

Mr. Lin, we have to hurry up.

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,479
There was a call from
the press conference.

33
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,679
Mr. Jiang is already there.

34
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,199
Is he? He is really free.

35
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,800
Then let him wait.

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,639
Sure. You're busy with work.

37
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,399
It's reasonable

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
to be a little bit late.

39
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,000
-Mr. Lin.
-Mr. Lin.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,919
Mr. Lin, may I ask you a few questions?

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,240
Hello, Mr. Lin.

42
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,320
What do you think of

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
the press conference today?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,639
Mr. Lin, may I ask about

45
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,039
your comments
on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

46
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,919
-Tell us please.
-Tell us please.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
You were entrusted with the mission
at a critical moment,

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,399
and you brought the company
an investment.

49
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,440
How did you make it?

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,960
What's wrong with these journalists?

51
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,080
Dad,

52
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,759
you are the one who was entrusted

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,919
and also who steered Yutian.

54
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,479
Why is everyone focusing on him?

55
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,960
Actually about these questions,

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
you should ask Mr. Jiang.

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,800
At the critical moment,

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
if it wasn't Mr. Jiang
who saved the critical situation,

59
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,679
there may not be this press conference.

60
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:45,320
Never mind.
Xiangyuan has also done a lot.

61
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,720
For young man as he is,

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,720
it's ok to show himself off
a little bit.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,839
Mr. Jiang is not only my teacher,

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
but also my leader.

65
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,040
I owe everything I've done

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,559
to Mr. Jiang for his

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,079
help and support behind the scenes.

68
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
So, thanks to Mr. Jiang,

69
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
I can achieve success today.

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,359
Mr. Lin, can I ask you another question?

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,000
For further questions,

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,399
let's go inside and ask,
shall we?

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,239
Ok. Excuse me.

Bro,

78
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,440
you have to watch
even if you don't want to.

79

This is the rule in the prison.

80

this is the first press conference
of Yutian Group

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,920
after the imprisonment
of the former president, Lei Yuzheng.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,119
Is it him?

88
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,760
Yes!

89
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,440
You don't look like that.

90
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,880
But I've been proven right.

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,320
I know you're not common.

92
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,200
So what?

93
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:13,200
Nobody is common in this room.

94
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
…Now he is in jail with us.

95
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,799
First of all, thank you all

96
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,279
for coming here. Today…

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,640
I guess,

98
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,959
your imprisonment

99
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,119
just gave this man a chance, right?

100
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,040
Make or break.

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,720
You can't blame others.

102
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,559
After the Entertainment Center project
is completed,

103
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,480
there will be

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
a more grand celebration.

105
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm full of confidence about it.

106

The Entertainment Center project

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,640
has experienced ups and downs

108
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,079
along the way.

109
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:57,040
Thus, on behalf of Yutian Group,

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,839
I'd like to express my deep gratitude

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,119
to everyone
who has contributed to this project.

112
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:01,959
Dad.

113
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,440
I still remember

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,600
when Yuzheng signed with S.G.,

115
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,559
it was also like this.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,119
There was
a spectacular press conference.

117
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,559
Probably you have forgot.

118
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,119
But I haven't.

119
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
The person standing here
to give the speech

120
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,839
shouldn't be Lin Xiangyuan.

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,399
It should be Yuzheng.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,440
Yuzheng is a good boy.

123
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,679
It's just...What a pity.

124
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,000
Fine. Forget it.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My little girl.

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not blaming you.

127
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:44,519
But since you're already engaged with
Lin Xiangyuan,

128
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,600
you shouldn't think about Lei Yuzheng
all the time.

129
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,839
What if Lin Xiangyuan is aware of this…

130
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,679
Dad,

131
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,359
I regret it.

132
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,000
At last.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,559
What?

134
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,440
Please allow me to thank...

135
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,559
What's wrong, Fanlv?

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,839
Nothing. I just feel something wrong
with my stomach.

137
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,040
…It's my teacher,

138
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,440
Mr. Jiang Jin.

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,880
He turns out to be a rich person.

140
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,119
So what?

141
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,600
He is still imprisoned here

142
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,119
like us.

143
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,200
Come on.
Let me have an interview with you.

144
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,320
Talk about how you feel now.

145
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,480
-Yes. Tell us.
-Tell us.

146
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,399
What are you doing?

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,920
Wanna a fight?

148
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,959
If I don't know you're rich,

149
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,519
I will let it go.

150
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,559
Since I know that now,

151
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,880
I'll beat you up.

152
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,760
Yuzheng, what are you doing?

153
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,959
Don't bother.

154
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,720
There are guards at the door.

155
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,519
You are not content with that!

156
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,640
Not content!

157
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,119
What are you doing?

158
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,119
What's going on here?

What's wrong with you?

163
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,599
Siyang, are you ok?

164
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,479
What happened?

165
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,919
He had a heart attack.

166
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,719
Please call the doctor!

167
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,880
Call the doctor!

168
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,400
Open all the windows.

169
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,320
Ventilate the room.

170

Siyang, come on.

171
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,479
Is he pretending?

172
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,320
Isn't he?

It's real.

175
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,200
It's all right.

176
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,679
Breathe in through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

Miss Jiang,

185
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,479
you don't look well.

00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,359
I'm fine.

188
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,300
(Qingpu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital,
Fudan University)

189
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,479
-Qunfei.
-Yes?

190
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,960
You said that
Yutian has a press conference today?

191
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,320
Why don't you go there?

192
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,919
For what?

193
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,799
I am just nobody now.

194
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,919
It doesn't matter whether I go or not.

195
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,400
Besides,

196
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,479
I can't stand the showy look

197
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,719
of Lin Xiangyuan.

198
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,119
I'm afraid I'll punch him if I go there.

199
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,239
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,080
Xiaosu,

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,799
Mr. Lei's hand just moved!

202
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,840
Look!

203
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,599
It's really moving!

204
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,479
Doctor! Doctor!

205
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
Doctor.

206
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,359
Mr. Lei just moved his hand.

207
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,559
Mr. Lei.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
He's awake! Mr. Lei is awake!

209
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,559
Great！

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Fanlv, how are you doing?

211
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,799
Are you still not feeling good?

212
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm fine. Much better.

213
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,559
Dad, I have something to deal with.
I've got to go.

214
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,159
Ok.

215
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,760
Why is she distracted?

216
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,479
Mr. Lin.

217
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,840
Mr. Jiang,

218
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll go to the construction site
with Mr. Xie.

219
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Are you coming with us?

220
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,400
You go ahead.

221
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,640
I've been sitting all day,

222
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,479
and I've really got some backache.

223
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm old and useless.

224
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,280
Come on.

225
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,000
You're vigorous.

226
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,559
Let me drive you home.

227
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,719
As a man,

228
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,320
you shall not nag me!

229
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,080
Business comes first.

230
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,239
Ok, take care.

231
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,416
(Press Conference)

232
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,799
Mr. Lin, let's go.

233
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,440
Mr. Lin.

234
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,840
The Entertainment Center project is
in great demand for money.

235
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
A hundred million is just gone
in the blink of an eye.

236
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,919
How much more money is expected?

237
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,679
There is nothing to expect.

238
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,919
You mean...

239
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,520
Not even a penny.

240
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,799
Yutian has other projects
other than the Entertainment Center.

241
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,039
Just put the Entertainment Center
project aside.

242
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,760
By the way,

243
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,280
what's wrong with Miss Jiang just now?

244
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,599
I just saw her vomit.

245
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,840
Vomit?

246
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,559
Keep an eye on her these days.

247
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,760
No matter what happens,

248
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,000
you must let me know.

249
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,359
Ok.

250
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:42,479
Ok.

251
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,599
I'm telling you two that

252
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,440
the patient is incapable now

253
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,039
and can't express himself.

254
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,760
So, there must be someone
with him every minute.

255
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,239
Otherwise,

256
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,960
there will be problems.

257
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,880
Thank you.

258
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,039
Please leave.

259
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,119
Back off!

260
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,719
Bad guy.

261
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,479
Excuse me. Excuse me.

262
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,559
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,719
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
Mr. Lei.

265
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,320
Bad guy.

266
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,679
Excuse me. Excuse me.

267
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,039
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

268
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,200
Mr. Lei,

269
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,760
you can't talk like this.

270
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,479
You're bad, too. Back off!

271
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,440
Ask bad guys to leave! Leave!

272
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,760
Fine, fine, fine.

273
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,280
Well, he is leaving right now.

274
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
He is leaving right now.

275
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,239
Mr. Lei, you're right.

276
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,880
I'm the bad guy.

277
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,520
Scold me.

278
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,799
He Qunfei, stop blaming yourself.

279
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,919
This is
the sequelae of cerebral hemorrhage.

280
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,799
He has no idea what he is talking about.

281
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,039
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

282
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,039
Xiaosu,

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,760
if Mr. Lei didn't wake up,

284
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,599
how could I explain to his son?

285
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,400
We were worried that

286
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,039
he could not wake up before.

287
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,719
But he's awake now.

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,960
So, we should be more confident now.

289
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,799
As long as he's not well,

290
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,400
we'll take care of him.

291
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
I believe that

292
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,559
he is gonna be fine one day.

293
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,880
Mr. Lei,

294
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,840
let's go home.

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,960
Here we go. Let's go home.

296
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,080
(Civilized Prison Cell)

297
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Why are you back?

298
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,400
Why? You don't know me?

299
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
Are you fine?

300
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,119
Don't worry.

301
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm a cat

302
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,280
with nine lives, and I can't just die.

303
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,520
Come over here. Have a seat.

304
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,280
Did you do it on purpose that day?

305
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,039
On purpose?

306
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,320
Are you pretending to be sick,

307
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,479
as you are afraid
I'm gonna get punished?

308
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,799
My heart

309
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,799
has problems.

310
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,039
If it was not you that day,

311
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,200
I would be gone.

312
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,760
Why? Wanna change your career?

313
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,679
Don't wanna be a boss any more?

314
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,719
Wanna take a job in finance?

315
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,640
Just take a look.

316
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,559
It seems like

317
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,919
you've also studied abroad.

318
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,679
Stanford Graduate School of Business.

319
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,919
That explains.

320
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,479
Your father is very far-sighted.

321
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,679
For such a large Group like Yutian,

322
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,400
there has to be someone to take over.

323
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,520
I failed them.

324
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,080
You can't put it this way.

325
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,760
You're not the only one to stumble
in the business world.

326
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,159
After I

327
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
graduated from Lancaster University
in the UK,

328
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,159
I joined

329
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,840
BlackRock in the UK.

330
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,320
In those years,

331
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,840
I was getting too arrogant.

332
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,039
See. This is where I am.

333
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,000
I haven't even asked you.

334
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
What's the reason?

335
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,799
Do you know
the Minsheng Road in Shanghai?

336
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,039
I

337
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,200
was the chief trader

338
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,479
in one of the fund management companies.

339
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,640
I don't need to tell you

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,799
the rest.

341
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,719
I don't get it.

342
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,880
I'm just like you.

343
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,440
Didn't you take all
the responsibilities on your own?

344
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,280
How do you know that?

345
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,840
Come out. It's time for exercise.

346
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,479
We have plenty of time. Take your time.

347
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,719
Mr. Lin, do you really wanna go there?

348
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,359
We should come sooner or later.

349
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,719
Since Lei Ting has been discharged
from the hospital,

350
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,560
we should come to see him.

351
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
He was the president of Yutian
after all.

352
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,079
Besides,

353
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,239
the one I hate is Lei Yuzheng,

354
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
not Lei Ting.

355
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,760
Let's go.

356
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,599
Mr. Lei.

357
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,520
Mr. Lei.

358
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,520
Guys.

359
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,680
Hello, uncle Duan.

360
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,920
This is our regard.

361
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,040
So sorry to cost you.
(Luxury Gifts)

362
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:52,920
Thank you.

363
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,199
Not at all.

364
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,119
Mr. Lei is taking a nap.

365
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,400
He was here to get some sun, well...

366
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,920
He's awake.

367
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,680
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

368
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,040
I'll make you some tea.

369
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,920
Go ahead.

370
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,119
Mr. Lei, I'm Lin Xiangyuan.

371
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,719
Do you still remember?

372
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,640
Mr. Lei,

373
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,520
it seems you've recovered pretty well.

374
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,199
Great. That's great.

375
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,920
Then we can set our mind at rest.

376
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,479
Right, Mr. Lei.

377
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,959
Mr. Lin is very concerned about you.

378
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,479
As soon as he heard that
you were discharged,

379
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:33,920
he left his work

380
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,319
and came to see you.

381
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,199
Bad guys.

382
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,599
Mr. Lei, you're so good at joking.

383
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,319
We all work for you.

384
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,719
How can we be bad guys?

385
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,920
That's right.

386
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,920
Bad guys. Bad guys.

387
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,680
Back off! Back off!

388
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,719
Mr. Lin,
is Lei Ting really out of his mind?

389
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,079
Look at him.

390
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,119
He wants to eat us alive!

391
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,599
Mr. Lei,

392
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,800
don't you remember who I am?

393
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
I'm Lei Yuzheng's colleague.

394
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,199
Yuzheng?

395
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,680
Right. Where is Yuzheng?

396
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,439
Where is Yuzheng?

397
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,280
Bad guy. Give Yuzheng back to me!

398
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,439
I'll kill you! Kill you!

399
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,280
Mr. Lin.

400
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Back off!

401
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,640
Let's go.

402
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,319
Back off!

403
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,719
Or I'm gonna shoot!

404
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,439
Mr. Lei, calm down.

405
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,880
Can we take it easy?

406
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,199
Back off! Or I'll shoot!

407
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,119
Mr. Lei,

408
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,800
you wanna hit people with the stick?

409
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,160
All of you are bad guys! Bad guys!

410
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,760
Please don't. Give it to me.

411
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,280
What's going on?

412
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,199
Excuse me.

413
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,079
Mr. Lei suffered a bad illness.

414
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,400
He hasn't recovered yet.
He's still confused.

415
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Are you hurt?

416
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,640
It's fine. It's fine.

417
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,079
Yuzheng, they are all bad guys.

418
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,439
They're guests.

419
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,880
You're bad, too.

420
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,719
Bad guy. Back off!

421
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,199
Look!

422
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,079
Back off! All of you!

423
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,160
Good lord.

424
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,839
He's yelling at everyone like this now?

425
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,520
He's out of his mind sometimes.

426
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Let's make it another day, shall we?

427
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,199
Fine.

428
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,479
Ask them to leave!

429
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,479
They 're gone.

430
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,920
Excuse me.

431
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,800
What's that about?

432
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,079
It's bloody hell out of luck.

433
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,359
Got beaten for nothing.

434
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,680
He is out of your mind, isn't he?

435
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Why is it so easy for him to get angry?

436
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,280
Never mind.

437
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
There is no need
to take offence at a patient.

438
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,199
Let him take it out.

439
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,719
Just consider it as

440
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,160
an apology I make to him.

441
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,040
Now Lei Yuzheng is in jail.

442
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,280
He is so sick.

443
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,479
Yutian shall count on me.

444
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,880
That's true.

445
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,920
You're the manager
of Yutian from now on.

446
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,079
You forgot about Jiang Jin and others.

447
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
Mr. Jiang is your future father-in-law.

448
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,800
He must be on your side.

449
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,479
Miss Jiang, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

450
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Pregnant?

451
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,439
How could that happen?

452
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,839
Are you making a mistake?

453
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,040
Look at the report.

454
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,640
Don't worry. It's already
one month and a half.

Fanlv.

461
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Why are you so grief when you see me.

462
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,119
Is it because I'm getting old?

463
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,719
I just didn't expect that

464
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,040
we would meet here.

465
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,479
Look at you now.

466
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,479
I feel very sorry.

467
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,239
Don't worry. I'm great.

468
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,199
If only
we could go back to our childhood.

469
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,839
I still remember that

470
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,079
lemon soda was your favourite drink.

471
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:55,640
You liked to make fun of girls
with caterpillars.

472
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,839
You also liked to defend Zhenrong.

473
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,439
We were carefree at that time.

474
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,520
We used to be together every day.

475
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,040
How wonderful it was!

476
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,719
This is fate.

477
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,479
You're too young for believing in fate.

478
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,880
Don't you think so?

479
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,239
I don' t believe in fate.

480
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:28,359
I am used to
making fate submitted to me.

481
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,719
But I've gradually realized that

482
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,599
fate will always give you a blow

483
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,040
out of surprise,

484
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,959
so that you'll know that
your previous ambitions

485
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,400
were just a joke.

486
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,920
Fanlv, remember that,

487
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,160
no matter when,

488
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,640
I'm your family.

489
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
I know.

490
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
I didn't want you to treat me
like a sister before.

491
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,040
Now I've realized

492
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,640
how much I rely on you.

493
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,880
As long as you're around,

494
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,199
no matter what serious things happen,

495
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,640
I won't be scared.

496
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,520
Now I've grown up.

497
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Now that I've made my decision,

498
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,760
I have to face it on my own.

499
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,439
I just came to see you.

500
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,719
As long as I see you,

501
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,479
I'll feel peace.

502
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,560
Fanlv.

503
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,239
Tell me.

504
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,119
Is there anything wrong?

505
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,359
Yuzheng, stop asking.

506
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,719
You're right.

507
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,839
Some things are meant to be happening.

508
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,800
Yuzheng,

509
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,920
don't worry.

510
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,199
No matter what happened,

511
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,479
no matter what I did,

512
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,880
I'll be good.

513
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,599
I'll wait for you to come out.

514
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,839
Take good care of yourself.

515
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,280

516
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,760
I wish you are happy.

517
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,119
I will.

518
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,560
Don't worry about me.

520
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:14,640

522
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,800

524

525
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,599

Why don't you tell me earlier?

531
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,319
Yes! Yes! Yes!

532
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,640
I can be a father!

533
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,640
I'm a father! Yes!

What? Anything else?

Mr. Lin,

537
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,520
miss Jiang is going to see
the obstetrics doctor tomorrow.

538
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,160
Ok.

539
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,920
Help me decline the work tomorrow.

540
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,920
I'll go with her.

541
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,839

542

She called the doctor for abortion.

543

Abortion?

544
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,119
That is my child!

545
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,119
It's my family's blood.

546
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,439
How dare she?

547
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,719
You're right.

555
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,479
you said this was pretty tasty.

556

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,439
Come over here.

559
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,359
Put them away.

560
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,079
Xiangyuan. You're too considerate.

561
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,520
I just said it,

562
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,160
you keep it in your mind.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What's wrong?

564
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,800
Mr. Jiang. Please don't tell Fanlv

565
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,280
those are from me.

566
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,520
Otherwise she'll lose her appetite.

567
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,160
That's who she is.

568
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,199
Don't mind her words.

569
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,400
Come here. Have a seat.

570
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:07,800
Mr. Jiang.
Fanlv went to visit Lei Yuzheng.

571
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
Fanlv and Lei Yuzheng

572
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
grew up playing together.

573
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,400
It's natural to go to see him.

574
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,319
Mr. Jiang. You misunderstood me.

575
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm just a little worried.

576
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,920
Although we are engaged,

577
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,959
but we're still not one family.

578
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm afraid I'm wasting her time.

579
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,160
To be honest,

580
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,880
even if Fanlv regrets it,

581
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,680
I have no complaints.

582
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,839
I just hope

583
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,040
she can find someone
who really loves her,

584
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,520
not for someone
who doesn't deserve her love.

585
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,920
She can't waste her time.

586
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,719
You're right.

587
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,439
It seems
as long as you're not married,

588
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,959
Fanlv's mind

589
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,760
won't settle.

590
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,319
How about this?

591
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,760
You prepare whatever you need.

592
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,040
I'll talk to Fanlv later.

593
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,959
Hurry up with your marriage.

594
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,400
Yes, Mr. Jiang, thank you.

595
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,680
I gotta go.

596
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,599
(Civilized Prison Cell)

597
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,000
Lei Yuzheng.

598
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,079
Get ready. Go to the reception room.

599
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,599
I don't wanna meet her.

600
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,319
Ok.

601
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,439
That girl is here.
You still don't see her.

602
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,800
Not willing?

603
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,280
I can't.

604
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,359
Why? Are you afraid you can't
hold on yourself if you meet her?

605
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,400
Look at yourself.

606
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,040
If I meet her one time,
she will come for another time.

607
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,119
So I can't meet her.

608
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,920
In my opinion,
that girl is pretty determined.

609
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,079
If you do like this,

610
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,839
I'm afraid she won't give it up.

611
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,880
Then find a way to make her give up.

612
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,560
People like me

613
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,719
have to be cruel.

614
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,680
That's being responsible for others.

615
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,160
What's the girl's name again?

616
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,719
Du Xiaosu.

617
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,079
Du Xiaosu.

618
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,520
Du Xiaosu.

619
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,239
Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,400
You are not cruel at all.

621
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,000
You love her deeply.

622
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,199
It really freaked me out

623
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,920
to take the flight of over ten hours.

624
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,920
Mrs. Shao. Look at you.

625
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:25,599
Going abroad to recover really works.

626
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,560
You look much better
and are in a good mood.

627
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,439
What can I do?

628
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,040
Zhenrong has been gone
for more than one year.

629
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,920
I wanna be with him.
But the God doesn't allow me.

630
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:38,719
There is no way out.
I have to live a few more years.

631
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,680
Mrs. Shao. What are you talking about?

632
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,560
Fine. Forget it.

633
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,439
Could you please sort out the presents?

634
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,319
The nutrients are for Mr. Lei.

635
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,280
What happened to you?

636
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:56,079
Mrs. Shao. You have no idea.

637
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,640
When you're not around,

638
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:01,119
there was something wrong
with Lei's family.

639
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,359
We had a deal, right?

640
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,839
If you take the medicine seriously,

641
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,079
you'll get better soon.

642
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,800
You shall take the medicine.

643
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,359
Mr. Lei. I'm coming.

644
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,400
Look.

645
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:15,040
Guess what I've brought to you.

646
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,920
Marshmallow.

647
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,040
Ok. Let's do this.

648
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,800
One bite of medicine.

649
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,199
One bite of marshmallow.

650
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,119
Come on.

651
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,479
Come on.

652
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,839
Take it slow.

653
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,359
Great.

654
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,520
Take the marshmallow.
Take the marshmallow.

655
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,319
Actually

656
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,680
There is no other way to coax him.

657
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,439
Just treat him like a kid.

658
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,280
Coax while persuading.

659
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,520
It depends on who it is.

660
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,560
Last time there were two guests.

661
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,280
Coax while persuading. It didn't work.

662
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,920
Mr. Lei kicked them out with the stick.

663
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,040
Who are they?

664
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,400
The last name of the boss is Lin.

665
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,880
It's said to be Yuzheng's colleagues,

666
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
who specially came to see him.

667
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,959
Lin Xiangyuan?

668
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,160
It seems to be like him.

669
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,959
Du Xiaosu. What are you doing here?

670
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,040
Aunt Shao.

671
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,280
Why don't you come in first?

672
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,160
I'll explain to you later.

673
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,560
Mr. Lei. What's wrong?

674
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,199
You have marshmallow on your lips.

675
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,239
Like a Santa Claus.

676
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,719
Let's take it off.

677
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,280
Done.

678
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,280
What did you just call me?

679
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:50,919
Marshmallow.

680
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Fine. Whatever you want.

681
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,639
As long as you're happy with it.

682
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,360
Marshmallow. Marshmallow.

683
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,520
Fine.

684
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,399
Mr. Lei. How about this?

685
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:05,399
As long as you're well behaved
in eating and sleeping,

686
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,879
every time I come to see you,

687
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,439
I'll bring you the marshmallow.

688
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,919
Fine. I promise.

689
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,120
Lei, this is Kaixuan.

690
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,239
Who is Kaixuan?

691
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,080
Mr. Lei. She's a friend.

692
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,520
Kaixuan is your friend.

693
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,320
A good friend.

694
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,560
A good friend.

695
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,000
He's confused again.

696
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,239
Aunt Shao, don't be sad.

697
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:44,439
The doctor said

698
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,879
This is the sequela of
cerebral hemorrhage.

699
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,199
It'll get better in a while.

700
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,120
All we need to do is
to take good care of him.

701
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
You've been taking care of him recently?

702
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,560
Mrs. Shao. You have no idea.

703
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,239
Thanks to Miss Du,

704
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,040
she has been coming all the time to
take care of Mr. Lei.

705
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:02,479
Though Mr. Lei is

706
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,639
confused sometimes,

707
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,280
who is the good guy or bad guy,

708
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,879
he knows it.

709
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,760
Dont' you, Mr. Lei?

710
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,479
Marshmallow, good guy.

711
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,479
See?

712
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Mr. Lei. How about this?

713
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,760
Let me talk with Aunt Shao.

714
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Uncle Duan will take a walk with you
and get some sun.

715
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,479
Ok.

716
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:25,959
Fine.

717
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:26,679
Ok?

718
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,320
Great!

719
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,840
Let' go. Slow down.

720
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,959
I'll leave you alone.

721
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,360
Mr. Lei is just like a child.

722
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:48,879
As long as you spend more time with him
and talk to him,

723
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,360
he'll be happy.

724
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,399
Have you ever thought about it?

725
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,840
After he is recovered,

726
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,520
how are you going to
explain about Yuzheng to him?

727
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:02,760
I think...

728
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,959
I can't even think about it now.

729
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,399
Take one day at a time.

730
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,239
Aunt Shao. I didn't expect

731
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,719
we could talk like this.

732
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,760
It's all the past.

733
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,840
Thank you for helping Yuzheng
in the difficult time.

734
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:32,080
Lei Yuzheng offered me a lot of help.

735
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,560
He's in trouble now. I feel responsible.

736
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,479
There is one thing.

737
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,080
I hope you can do me a favor.

738
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,399
Lei Yuzheng is very stubborn.

739
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,639
He's in such a big trouble now.

740
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,000
He certainly doesn't need
the pity from others,

741
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,360
and doesn't want to get others
in trouble.

742
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,320
So he doesn't wanna see me right now.

743
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,919
But I know,

744
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,760
what he is most worried about
is his father.

745
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,879
If you visit him next time,

746
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,120
please help me take this picture to him.

747
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,840
Thank you.

748
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:16,280
Don't say that. That's what I should do.

749
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,919
Mrs. Have you really made up your mind

750
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:55,719
to give up this baby?

751
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,159
If you haven't figured it out,

752
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,080
then calm down and think about it.

753
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,000
Generally speaking,

754
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
we don't suggest
to give up the first baby.

755
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,479
If you can keep it, keep it.

756
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,639
No. I've made up my mind.

757
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,239
Lin Xiangyuan. You are following me!

758
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,439
Fanlv.

759
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,320
I am concerned.
You've suffered from vomiting recently.

760
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm begging you.

761
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,679
Could you please keep the baby?

762
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,239
This baby is ours after all.

763
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,560
I'm his father.

764
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:41,479
In any case,

765
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,760
you should discuss with me.

766
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes, you're the father of the baby.

767
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,520
But you know that

768
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,239
it's not the right time for this baby.

769
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,879
I know.

770
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,840
This baby is not our plan.

771
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,520
You're not prepared yet.

772
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,239
No matter how much you hate me

773
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,199
or be mad at me,

774
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,439
We're the parents of this baby.

775
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,479
The baby is innocent.

776
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,439
I'm begging you.

777
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,560
Could you please keep this baby?

778
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,120
I know you're very angry.

779
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,199
I swear.

780
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,439
No matter what you wanna do to me,

781
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,959
I promise
I won't fight back or swear back.

782
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,000
Even if you ask me to disappear,

783
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
I'll be fine.

784
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,159
As long as you keep this baby.

785
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,560
Fanlv. I shouldn't be with you,

786
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,159
knowing that you don't love me.

787
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:47,959
I promise you.

788
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,239
I can disappear from your life.

789
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
I...tomorrow...

790
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,760
No. I will...at once...

791
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,479
I will resign at once,

792
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,399
leave the company and the city.

793
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,280
But if you can give birth to this baby,

794
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,199
I'll try all my best to love him

795
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:07,800
and protect him.

796
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,679
As long as he can stay,

797
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,320
it'll be enough for me.

798
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,800
I swear.

799
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,600
Wait a minute.
