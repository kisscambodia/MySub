<i>Episode 16</i>

17
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,360
What's wrong? Are you mad at me?

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,959
Do you enjoy ordering me around?

19
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,119
Sorry.

20
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,080
I won't ask you

21
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
to serve me tea or water again.

22
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,280
I can forgive you.

23
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,879
But Su Yue La won't.

24
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,119
It's a pleasant moment. Why must you
bring up her name?

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Your Highness.

26
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,839
Curse that witch.

27
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,200
Why is she here?

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,599
I told you.

29
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,319
She won't be restless at night.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,200
There are rules.

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,599
Princess and Prince Consort

32
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,080
may sleep together once every seven days.

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,759
You must restrain your urges until then.

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,119
In that case,

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll be waiting outside

36
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,319
until Your Highness decides to
go to your room with me.

37
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,239
Your Highness, please be quick.

38
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,560
Tell her I'm not around.

39
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,440
Go on.

40
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,879
It's futile.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
She will barge in here to arrest you.

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,759
I'm not going.

43
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,920
Just go. Hurry up.

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,399
No!

45
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,399
Go on.

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,759
No!

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,039
Just go.

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,720
What happened?

49
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,720
Jing Xin.

50
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,160
She won't let me sleep with Cheng Cheng.

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,280
She even asked me to leave the room.

52
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,200
I'll handle it for you.

53
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,680
I'll distract her.

54
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,120
Your Highness.

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Please.

56
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,759
Rest well, Your Highness.

57
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,640
I'll wait here and keep watch.

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,200
No evildoer will sneak past me!

59
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,920
We have a majestic full moon tonight.

60
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,159
Every time there is a full moon,

61
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,719
I always spend the night alone.

62
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,080
But I have you to keep me company tonight.

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,840
I somehow feel...

64
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,479
a little touched.

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,479
Everyone would miss some
old friends on quiet nights.

66
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,319
Whether it's old acquaintances or new friends,

67
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,240
I always wish there could be

68
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:15,759
a soulmate by my side

69
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,400
who could listen to my thoughts at this moment.

70
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,960
A soulmate?

71
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,120
Who wouldn't want a soulmate?

72
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,680
But it's all part of fate's plan.

73
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,800
It's destiny.

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,479
It seems like...

75
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,599
It seems like...

76
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,559
you have your fair share of woes too, Official Su.

77
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,999
Mr. Mo, you're Prince Consort's birth father.

78
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:11,159
You're also a role model of
manly virtues in Dongyue.

79
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,159
You've been a widower for over ten years

80
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,559
and never involved in indecency.

81
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
Your virtuous character is truly impressive.

82
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,319
I'm flattered, Official Su.

83
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,719
Her Highness couldn't sleep by herself

84
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
and Prince Consort is responsible for that.

85
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,039
He must be supervised closely.

86
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,879
I've invited you here,

87
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,759
so you can show him the right path

88
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,279
and tell him not to break the
moral codes for men again

89
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,719
by seducing Her Highness with his charm!

90
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I insisted on staying in his room.

91
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,559
He wasn't seducing me.

92
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,279
Your Highness and Mo Yan Chen
were childhood friends.

93
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,920
His love for you stays true and unyielding.

94
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,719
If Mo Lian Cheng hadn't employed seduction,

95
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:02,439
Your Highness wouldn't have disowned him.

96
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:02,920
You...

97
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,200
Her Majesty has orders for Your Highness.

98
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,319
This way, Your Highness.

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,599
Father.

100
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,360
I was merely putting up with
Su Yue La's inspection.

101
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,920
That's all there is to it.

102
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,800
I have nothing more to teach you.

103
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,200
Come to the study with me.

104
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
The study?

105
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
Since she wants me to teach you
moral codes for men,

106
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
you can copy some moral codes and fool her.

107
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,719
Father. Su Yue La is acting suspiciously.

108
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,840
Please be cautious.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
I'm aware of what's happening.

110
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,840
I don't need your lecture.

111
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,999
Mo Yuan Long and Mo Lian Cheng are still acting as

112
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,720
loving father and son in the presence of outsiders.

113
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,359
But they barely interact

114
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,119
with each other in private.

115
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,119
They each copied a set of moral codes for men.

116
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,319
My guess is it's just for show

117
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,559
to fool us.

118
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,840
They have grown estranged because of

119
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,919
Mo Yan Chen's repudiation.

120
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,879
They haven't reconciled for the moment.

121
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,640
Whether you're right or not, we can't
draw conclusions rashly.

122
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,280
Keep observing.

123
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,040
Employ some tactics if necessary.

124
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,759
I will aid you.

125
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,080
Yes. I shall take my leave now.

126
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,679
<i>Troubles might stir at the armory
and the provision warehouse.</i>

127
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,280
<i>Come to Black Cloak Alley at 3 AM.</i>

128
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,119
<i>This is my father's handwriting.</i>

129
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,679
<i>But I've withdrawn myself from the rebellion.</i>

130
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,160
I supervised my son as he copied
moral codes for men.

131
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,359
He should learn his mistakes after
copying the text with diligence.

132
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,759
<i>Could it be...</i>

133
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,439
<i>that Su Yue La mimicked my father's handwriting</i>

134
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,040
<i>to see if I'm still working with the rebels?</i>

135
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,520
<i>Then my father must have received a letter</i>

136
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,319
<i>that imitated my handwriting.</i>

137
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,319
Officials, it's time.

138
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,759
When the two rebels arrive,

139
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,200
take them both down.

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,960
Yes!

141
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,020
<i>Black Cloak Alley</i>

142
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,480
My Lord.

143
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,799
Why are you here?

144
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,520
Eighth Young Master sent me here to wait for you.

145
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
This meeting is Su Yue La's scheme.

146
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,280
There is an ambush ahead.

147
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,280
We should both leave now.

148
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,439
Have mercy on me!

149
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:05,799
This...

150
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,640
My father is very ill!

151
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,960
I was going to ask for a doctor at the clinic!

152
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,280
Have mercy on me!

153
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
Please spare my life!

154
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,640
Scram.

155
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,400
Officials, this is my mistake.

156
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,999
We might have been exposed.

157
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,840
In that case, fall back.

158
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
Let's go.

159
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,480
So Her Majesty didn't send Su Yue La here

160
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,960
to teach us the rites or reimpose laws of virtues.

161
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,799
She is here to investigate

162
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:41,999
whether my men and I have secretly joined
hands with your father's rebellion.

163
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,040
This is huge plotting.

164
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,400
Su Yue La is cunning.

165
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,960
She is also conspiring with Qu Mei Er.

166
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,359
She will be a great threat if she stays.

167
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,280
That is why

168
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,559
we must get leverage on her

169
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,720
to prevent further risks.

170
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,239
She may be sneaky,

171
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,960
but I'll show her the real deal.

172
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,160
Judging by your eyes,

173
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,400
you can show her a great deal.

174
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,720
Her youth is behind her and she is still single.

175
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,439
Perhaps

176
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,080
the loneliness is tormenting her heart.

177
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
What dirty scheme are you up to now?

178
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,600
Are you...

179
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,080
You'll see.

180
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,359
Are you sure this person

181
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,960
used to be in love with Su Yue La?

182
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,439
He was her first love.

183
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,400
It's the first love!

184
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,439
I ordered Jing Xin to ask around.

185
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,480
Su Yue La hasn't married other men

186
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,919
because she couldn't move on

187
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,799
from the man in this picture.

188
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,480
But we got the description from others,

189
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,919
then the painter drew this based on ours.

190
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,799
Are you sure this is what he really looks like?

191
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,999
Official Wang has checked this picture.

192
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,799
She is from Su Yue La's hometown.

193
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,759
She confirmed that

194
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,999
the man looks exactly like this picture.

195
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,119
But this man

196
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,160
somehow looks familiar.

197
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,160
It reminds me of someone.

198
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,239
I think I've met this man before as well.

199
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,480
I feel like...

200
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,600
I got it. Come on.

201
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,559
My skill as a makeup artist is unquestionable.

202
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Now he does look like

203
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,239
the man in this picture.

204
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:26,080
With some beard,

205
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,640
he can win her heart for sure.

206
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:31,960
You have a point.

207
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,359
I was told that Young Master
will draw me a portrait.

208
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,280
But what is it for?

209
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
We should tell him the truth.

210
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,999
You want me to seduce Su Yue La?

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
How can I do that to her?

212
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,239
Calm down.

213
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,640
I'll double your salary for the next month.

214
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,999
I don't give up my money for honor...

215
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,080
No, I don't trade my honor for money!

216
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,799
This is a great chance to display your charm!

217
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,600
This isn't embarrassing at all.

218
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,960
I wouldn't mind if it was others.

219
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,119
But it's Su Yue La...

220
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:07,799
I just can't do it.

221
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,879
Young Master, please don't make me do it.

222
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:11,919
Yu Hao.

223
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,400
You already know the ambush in Black Cloak Alley.

224
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,640
Su Yue La will cause us more trouble in the future.

225
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,359
Her Highness's and my safety...

226
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,080
are in your hands.

227
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,480
You should put some effort into this.

228
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,439
Leave.

229
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:55,080
She misses the man from her memories,
his gentle manner is never forgotten.

230
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:01,319
He lives in the cabin in the woods, but his
presence has my heart bewildered.

231
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,999

Official Su, you have your hands full.

Of course, you wouldn't notice a mere servant.

But should you ever need anything,

Especially the scent.

271
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,559
Scents can be so fascinating.

272
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
We can't see nor touch it.

273
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,519

274
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,360
the memories come pouring in.

was very dear to you.

286
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240

Isn't this what you want?

296
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,760
I don't think it's appropriate.

297
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,919

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,439
doesn't cause any trouble here,

340
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,799

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200

354
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,039

363
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Official Su, stand up.

364
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,679
I know your frustration.

365
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,840
But if there's no major movement,
please stay cautious.

366
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,679
If you come to my manor too often,

367
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,639
people might start suspecting.

368
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,360
But I serve Her Majesty.

369
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,319
If Your Highness wants to know
what Her Majesty is doing,

370
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,039
I'll still have to come here to inform you.

371
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,720
Your Highness.

372
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,639
Eldest Young Master refused to

373
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,439
accept the ginseng soup you sent again.

374
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,799
I must see to other matters.
I should go now, Official Su.

375
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,279
Your Highness? Your Highness? Your Highness!

376
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,200
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

377
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,679
How is the investigation I sent you on?

378
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,600
As Your Majesty expected,

379
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,519
Su Yue La and Eldest Princess

380
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,799
have been meeting more frequently.

381
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,600
She is conspiring with Qu Mei Er.

382
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,039
I had already turned a blind eye to it.

383
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,720
The inspection on the operation progress

384
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:31,039
was a bold move from her.

385
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,799
Your Majesty values loyalty the most.

386
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,399
Su Yue La has defected.

387
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
She betrayed Your Majesty.
Her sin cannot be forgiven.

388
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,679
Send my word to Second Princess's
Residence tomorrow.

389
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,679
Su Yue La will be assigned to Yu Prefecture
to work as its new governor.

390
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,960
She must set out immediately.

391
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,360
I shall get rid of the root of the trouble

392
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
while she is stationed at that remote land.

393
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,039
Yes.

394
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,439
Your Majesty.

395
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,319
The operation is still a priority.

396
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,120
Yes.

397
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,600
<i>Princess's Residence</i>
As decreed by Her Majesty,

398
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,200
Supervisor of Internal Affairs Su Yue La

399
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,240
is wise and righteous.

400
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,439
She has been appointed the
Governor of Yu Prefecture.

401
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
Effective immediately.

402
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,600
The end.

403
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,840
Yu Prefecture?

404
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,519
That is a remote and barren land!

405
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:53,480
After Official Wu was sent to Yu Prefecture,

406
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,360
her corpse was found in the wild.

407
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,439
I can't go there. I can't be there!

408
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,880
I want to serve Her Majesty! I must stay!

409
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
Kneel and be grateful for the offer.

410
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,360
No.

411
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:06,880
No.

412
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,240
Your Highness. Your Highness!

413
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,399
Your Highness, save me!

414
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
Put up a few good words for me to Her Majesty.

415
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,439
I can be your servant!

416
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,399
I will forever be loyal to you!

417
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,200
I will devote my life to serve Your Highness!

418
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,279
Official Su, this is a promotion.

419
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,080
Technically speaking, you should
have my congratulations.

420
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,519
Your Highness. Your Highness!

421
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,840
Your Highness! Save me!

422
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
I can't go to that place!

423
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,919
Your Highness, save me! Your Highness!

424
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,639
I can't disobey Her Majesty's order.

425
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,799
Official Su, you should accept your fate.

426
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,200
Be on your way.

427
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,880
Qu Tan Er.

428
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:58,760
If you did not set me up,

429
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,720
I wouldn't have gone so far!

430
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,960
I'll kill you!

431
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,880
I'll kill you!

432
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,559
Cheng Cheng, you got hurt.

433
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,360
Qu Tan Er, I curse you!

434
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,120
I'll kill you!

435
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,679
I'll kill you!

436
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,840
Let go of me!

437
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,600
Qu Tan Er! I'll kill you!

438
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,039
Let me go!

439
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,799
Qu Tan Er! I'll kill you!

440
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,240
Cheng Cheng, how are you?

441
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,519
Are you all right?

442
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,039
Bear with it a little. I'll get the medicine.

443
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,960
Tan Er.

444
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,639
Are you my Cheng Cheng?

445
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,399
Yes. I am your Cheng Cheng.

446
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,080
I'm glad you're fine.

447
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,399
I'm so glad...

448
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,360
you've been waiting for me.

449
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,559
Do you know how hard it has been for me?

450
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,639
Do you know how badly I want to

451
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,720
go back to raise our son with you?

452
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,246
Do you know how much I had missed you?

453
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,990
♪You turn around as the firework fades♪

454
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
♪Fate played a trick on me
so I pick up my flute again♪

455
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,480
I know.

456
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,639
I know everything now.

457
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:02,030
♪The string broke and the song ended,
they went their separate ways♪

458
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,039
I also know...

459
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,240
you're a stubborn cockroach.

460
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,799
You're a cockroach.

461
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,360
Now, listen to me.

462
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,960
When Su Yue La attacked you,

463
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,399
I regained my memories.

464
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,439
But...

465
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,360
All right, don't worry.

466
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,840
I know everything now.

467
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,600
Whenever I feel worried for you

468
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,519
or when I feel jealous,

469
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
our memories together or
any familiar conversations

470
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,679
will come back to me.

471
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,439
I'll regain my memories.

472
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,679
I am aware of these factors too.

473
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:02,880
I used them to restore your memories.

474
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,159
But it doesn't work every single time.

475
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,039
Just now

476
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,679
Su Yue La tried to stab you.

477
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,399
The worry and fear I felt

478
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,039
were like a leash,

479
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:19,480
it binds my heart.

480
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,360
My heartbeat elevated.

481
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,720
It was like it's going to come out of me.

482
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,039
You mean

483
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,919
your fear caused palpitation.

484
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,280
When I regained my memories back then,

485
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,800
I had the same feeling.

486
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,119
I get it now.

487
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,240
You managed to regain your memories

488
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,159
because the situation you were in

489
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,320
shared great resemblance
to our past experiences.

490
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,200
At the same time, your heartbeat

491
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,040
elevated in a short time.

492
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,720
When it reaches a certain level,

493
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,280
your memories will come back to you.

494
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,639
A certain level?

495
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:04,720
We don't have an electrocardiogram

496
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,200
or CT scans in this world.

497
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
We don't even have MRI here.

498
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,399
I'm not sure what that particular rate is.

499
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,480
But one thing is certain.

500
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,480
When your emotion reaches its peak,

501
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,280
the gateway to your memories will be opened.

502
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,119
Who would have thought

503
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,639
Physician Qu's theory actually
has academic values?

504
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,639
However,

505
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,960
there are matters at hand

506
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,240
that require time to plan.

507
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:40,760
Also,

508
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,599
I haven't regained my power either.

509
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,520
As long as you're my dear Cheng Cheng.

510
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,359
As for your power...

511
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,040
Only one thing matters.

512
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:14,140
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

513
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,280
<i>Tan Er.</i>

514
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,119
<i>Returning a gift is the only excuse I can have</i>

515
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,599
<i>to see you again.</i>

516
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,040
Give it to me.

517
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,879
Young Master, what about we send
someone else to inform them?

518
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,000
No need.

519
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,399
Whenever it is,

520
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,240
I always belong to Second Princess's Residence.

521
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:00,000
Su Yue La was eventually useful

522
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,839
before she got lost.

523
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,159
Now...

524
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,760
we finally know how to trigger your memories.

525
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,159
Since it's a double delight,

526
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,679
shouldn't we celebrate it?

527
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,399
How should we celebrate it?

528
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,679
You know the rules.

529
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,760
If we kiss now,

530
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,520
you'll become the other guy again.

531
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,839
Even without my memories of the past,

532
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:40,960
I will always be myself.

533
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,919
I'm still the one who will never get tired

534
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,520
of kissing you thousands of times.

535
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,480
This house...

536
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,119
has no place for me.

537
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,480
Everything I've sacrificed...

538
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,280
was just a joke.

539
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,399
Get out!

540
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,560
How many times have I told you?

541
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,919
I told you to get out.

542
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,480
It's me, Yan Chen.

543
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,320
Why are you here?

544
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,560
Yan Chen, no matter what you want to do,

545
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,399
I'll always be there for you.

546
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,439
Even if I have to anger the world

547
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,919
and get cursed by thousands of people,

548
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:50,679
I will still be by your side.

549
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,280
Why?

550
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,520
Do I not deserve...

551
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,000
the slightest attention...

552
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,960
or affection from them?

553
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,159
You've done nothing wrong.

554
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,720
It's their fault.

555
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,800
You should blame the customs
for making you obey.

556
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,119
The customs?

557
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,879
It's like a knife...

558
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,359
that is stabbing in my heart.

559
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,599
I could only let my blood...

560
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:28,760
slowly drain away from my body.

561
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,399
No, Yan Chen.

562
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:37,439
No?

563
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,800
No one is willing to give me any hope!

564
00:41:57,399 --> 00:42:01,960
You will have the best life out of all men.

565
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,679
You'll have the most freedom.

566
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,800
You'll live more like yourself.
