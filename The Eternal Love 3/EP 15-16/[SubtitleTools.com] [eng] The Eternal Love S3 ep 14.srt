<i>The Eternal Love S3</i>

16
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,350
<i>Episode 14</i>

17
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm so terribly sorry.

18
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,520
Sorry.

19
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,950
Where are you going?

20
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,080
I met your gaze.

21
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,830
You're the right man.

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,280
You have great reflexes.

23
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,520
You have the capacity of the Five Elements

24
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,670
and the heroic poise that people admire.

25
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,280
I can tell you're a man who can
make waves in human history!

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
You must have fooled quite a lot of people.

27
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,390
<i>Aside from the weird princess girl,</i>

28
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>business has been very slow.</i>

29
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,750
<i>Did she find out I was scamming her,</i>

30
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,520
<i>so she sent her goon to take me out?</i>

31
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,390
This is all a misunderstanding.

32
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,310
The second princess got it wrong.

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,720
It's possible

34
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,920
that I got the wrong medicine.

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,230
But whatever the case is,

36
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,080
the money had already been spent.

37
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,800
There are no refund policies.

38
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,640
Capturing me won't do you any good.

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,950
What was the medicine for?

40
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,280
Who was it for?

41
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,520
I am a hermit anyway.

42
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,670
I enjoy the seclusion

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,440
and despise any connection with the officials.

44
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,030
So I became a recluse.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,520
But Her Highness's heartfelt story moved me.

46
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
So the medicine...

47
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,640
Of course,

48
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
the prescription is top-secret.

49
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,870
As for whom she gave it to,

50
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,440
I have no idea.

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,800
<i>Just as the villagers said,</i>

52
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
<i>this man really is a fraud.</i>

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
<i>But Qu Tan Er came asking for his help.</i>

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,270
<i>Could there be a reason behind it?</i>

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,470
All and all,

56
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,310
I refuse to participate in any mortal affairs.

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,310
Of course,

58
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,030
there are duties I cannot neglect.

59
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,750
It's a pleasure to meet a master like you.

60
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,710
Your help will be much appreciated in the future.

61
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,840
Certainly.

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,840
Certainly.

63
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,520
It's getting more challenging to run a business.

64
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,270
Perhaps I should hide and wait it out.

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
Why should I hide?

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Anyone loves money.

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
You have a point.

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,710
The fortune-teller the second princess went to

69
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
was nothing but a fraud.

70
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,270
The expensive herbs she bought

71
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,200
were meant for Mo Lian Cheng.

72
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
You're right.

73
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,920
It couldn't be him.

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,870
Perhaps the increased dosage

75
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,360
has made me paranoid.

76
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,640
I wish nothing but a long life for Your Majesty.

77
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,590
You can just leave the trivial matters to me.

78
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,430
Only you can share my burdens.

79
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,240
Prince.

80
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Guess who am I?

81
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Why are you calling me "Prince"?

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,800
You still haven't regained your memories.

83
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,870
I have an idea.

84
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Sit over there.

85
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,400
Teach me how to play the zither like you used to.

86
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,640
I can just hold you in my arms.

87
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,520
That's not the same.

88
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Hug me and teach me...

89
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,150
Tan! Bad news!

90
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,710
What is it? Come in.

91
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,310
You sent me to get back at Liu Bai Shui.

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,870
But as soon as I arrived,

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,400
I saw Xiao Zhen and his men arrive at his doorstep.

94
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,550
He even took money from Xiao Zhen.

95
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,310
That cursed traitor.

96
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,080
Liu Bai Shui?

97
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,590
He got you the hair-removal pill.

98
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,680
I hired him to make you

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
some medicine to help you regain your memory.

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,470
I didn't know he would swap it out.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
Who is this man?

102
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,920
I used to know someone

103
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,520
who looked exactly like him.

104
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
We both crossed paths with him.

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,840
We crossed paths with him?

106
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,240
Forget about him.

107
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,120
Ever since he gave me that fake medicine,

108
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,360
I was certain he was not Liu Qian Shui.

109
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,750
I sent Jing Xin to get back at him.

110
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,240
Liu Qian Shui?

111
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,400
In the parallel world,

112
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,680
he was a sage from the Xuanling Continent.

113
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,800
He was looking for a host for
the Soul-guarding Bead.

114
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
So he found me.

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,960
He also gave me the Soul-parting Flute.

116
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,120
The Xuanling Continent?

117
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,310
What bead?

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,310
The Soul-parting Flute?

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Kid, you must have many questions.

120
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,200
I forgot. You don't remember anything.

121
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,470
Jing Xin.

122
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,270
Where is that traitor?

123
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,590
I tied him up.

124
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,870
How dare you lie to me!

125
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,240
If you tell another lie,

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,310
I'll order Jing Xin to cut you once.

127
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,550
My guard

128
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,960
is cruel and her blade is blunt.

129
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,150
It might take thousands of cuts

130
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,550
before your finally ends!

131
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,520
My goodness.

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,750
What do you want from me?

133
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,800
Why would you want to chop me up?

134
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,550
Your Highness, I explained everything.

135
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,870
I didn't tell anyone about

136
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,800
your amnesia medicine.

137
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Then explain yourself.

138
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,240
Your name is Liu Bai Shui.

139
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,400
Why did you lie to me and say you are Liu Qian Shui?

140
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,640
I didn't lie to you.

141
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,480
I told you right away my name was Liu Bai Shui.

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,790
You even asked me why it's nine hundred less.

143
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,640
It was you who mistook me for someone else.

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,280
Are you sure you're not

145
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,040
Liu Qian Shui who just dyed your hair black?

146
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,310
I really am not.

147
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,280
Do you have an elder brother named Liu Qian Shui?

148
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,350
No.

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
What about your father?

150
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,600
Your father's father?

151
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,230
Let me put it this way.

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
My name is Liu Bai Shui. My father is Liu Hei Shui.

153
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,750
We have Hei Shui and Bai Shui,

154
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,040
but there is no Liu Qian Shui.

155
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
As for my identity...

156
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,040
I've been...

157
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,640
I've been single.

158
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
For so many years,

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,080
I've upheld my innocence

160
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,400
and remained reserved.

161
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,400
Jing Xin, inform the authority.

162
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,480
I want this fraud arrested!

163
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:51,870
No!

164
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes!

165
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,110
Wait, Your Highness.

166
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,990
If we hand him over to the authority,

167
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,840
Her Majesty will take over the case.

168
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,670
During the interrogation,

169
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,520
he will be tortured.

170
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,480
Yes!

171
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,720
The prince consort knows what to say.

172
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,480
You're

173
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,310
clearly a righteous person, a handsome man

174
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,200
with a kind heart and good...

175
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,400
Perhaps...

176
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,960
We should take him out instead.

177
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,110
I like that plan!

178
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,670
Sure!

179
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,430
Your Highness!

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,550
Have mercy on me!

181
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,870
Please spare me.

182
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,400
Maybe...

183
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
Maybe Your Highness could give me
a chance to redeem myself.

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,200
Okay?

185
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,110
You took my rival's money.

186
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,310
You can redeem nothing.

187
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,230
Don't be so sure.

188
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,310
I have a trick up my sleeves.

189
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,310
For example,

190
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm a knowledgeable person.

191
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,430
I know fortune-telling and how to
ward off evil spirits.

192
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,280
Stop bluffing!

193
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,080
No! Even if those were bluffs,

194
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,350
I am a master in astrology.

195
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,790
Astrology, you know?

196
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,080
Fine. There is nothing you can't do.

197
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I didn't lie about astrology.

198
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,400
That is true.

199
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,840
I think

200
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,520
I can be of great use to you.

201
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,110
I may not be useful to you now,

202
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,960
but at least I can provide some advice.

203
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,790
Whatever the case is,

204
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,750
please let me stay.

205
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,310
I will be of use to you someday.

206
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,110
Your Highness, show some mercy, okay?

207
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,670
A kind heart

208
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,790
will keep you out of harm's way.

209
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,670
Jing Xin.

210
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,640
I'm grateful to Your Highness.

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,350
Much obliged, strong warrior.

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
Enough of your flattery.

213
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,040
Tell me, what is your plan?

214
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,720
So the prince consort has amnesia.

215
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,040
That is good.

216
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,110
Wait.

217
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,520
I mean you're good-looking.

218
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,080
Good-looking.

219
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,160
Are you done yet?

220
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
His handsome look has nothing to do with you.

221
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,280
That is true enough.

222
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,430
But since we're talking about amnesia,

223
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm thinking...

224
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,110
Perhaps...

225
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,910
he should try to recall

226
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,400
some incidents that happened in the past.

227
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,310
I thought of that long ago.

228
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,720
We've tried to

229
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,720
recall plenty of the past memories.

230
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,790
But it's not working at all!

231
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,960
It's not working.

232
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
If it's not working,

233
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
maybe it's because

234
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,080
it was difficult to replicate

235
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,230
the exact event that took place.

236
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,520
But you should at least get the rough image.

237
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,720
Did you do that?

238
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,600
We missed the mark a little on that.

239
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,790
See? This may be the cause.

240
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,430
Apart from that,

241
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,750
did you fail to recall any other memories?

242
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,080
Yes!

243
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,790
There was bloodshed...

244
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,040
and some...

245
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,840
There were some memories concerning our privacy.

246
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,280
My goodness!

247
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,910
Memories concerning your privacy!

248
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,350
That's why you wanted to get it working.

249
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,790
Since they are about to get working,

250
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,480
as outsiders,

251
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,870
we should give them some privacy.

252
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm no outsider!

253
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,280
Of course, you are!

254
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,600
Can't you read the mood

255
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,230
with your big eyes?

256
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,110
I'm not an outsider!

257
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,550
Of course, you are!

258
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,870
Your Highness.

259
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,160
What could...

260
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,870
be more embarrassing...

261
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,840
than what you've done so far?

262
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,790
Some matters are not meant to be talked about.

263
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,480
Why?

264
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,110
Do you have an urge for a more
exciting experience?

265
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,230
Your Highness, I did as you ordered

266
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,400
and dug a pit.

267
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,910
Who are we burying?

268
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,520
No! No, Your Highness!

269
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,110
I don't want to die just yet!

270
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Why are you a coward this time?

271
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,960
Jing Xin.

272
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,040
Take Yu Hao on a stroll.

273
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,790
Make some distance if you can.

274
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,910
I have something serious to talk
to the prince consort.

275
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,720
Yes.

276
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,790
Come on.

277
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,910
Prince Consort, if you need anything,

278
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,990
just yell and let me know!

279
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,790
Don't worry.

280
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,910
He's gone far.

281
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,160
But...

282
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,870
Don't say a word.

283
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,990
Jump into it with me.

284
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,400
Perhaps that might make you
remember everything.

285
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,040
Into the pit?

286
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,520
We must pretend that we slip and fall into it.

287
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
I'll land on you.

288
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,520
You'll act as a cushion.

289
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,910
You're taking advantage of me.

290
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,430
Why should I be your cushion?

291
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,310
It's not that I want it that way,

292
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,790
but that was how it happened.

293
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,960
If I wanted to take advantage of you,

294
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,400
I wouldn't come to the woods

295
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,040
just to make you fall into a pit.

296
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,480
Hurry up.

297
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,640
Everything will become clear to you.

298
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,910
Nonsense.

299
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,160
It's not nonsense. This is serious!

300
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,110
Stop pulling me

301
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,720
I need to kick you into it.

302
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,230
This doesn't seem right.

303
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
What's wrong?

304
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,870
As you mentioned before,

305
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,840
I was an invincible warrior.

306
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,790
You lied to me!

307
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,080
I'll explain what happened.

308
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,310
You were trying to save me.

309
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,910
I panicked and dragged you down with me.

310
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,110
But the pit was too deep.

311
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,870
I couldn't get out even I've tried everything.

312
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,280
If I was an invincible warrior,

313
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,430
why would I even need your help?

314
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,230
I later found out

315
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,200
you were trying to spend some time alone with me.

316
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,750
If we were in love,

317
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,990
why would we be here

318
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,910
if we wanted to spend some time together?

319
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,230
You're lying to me again.

320
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,600
No!

321
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,640
You weren't really yourself back then.

322
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,350
You said so yourself.

323
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,400
It wasn't the real me.

324
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,080
Even if I jumped into this pit,

325
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,670
would I remember anything at all?

326
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,350
This is confusing.

327
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,520
Tell me.

328
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,400
How did we get out of the pit?

329
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,110
You flew out while carrying me in your arms.

330
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,280
I could fly?

331
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,480
If I could fly,

332
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,350
why would I get dragged into the pit by you?

333
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Mo Lian Cheng.

334
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,720
I think you're confusing me on purpose!

335
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,310
I think you remember it wrong!

336
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,870
There is nothing logical about this incident.

337
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,910
I'm not doing it.

338
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,600
I might as well shoot myself in the foot.

339
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,430
Cheng Cheng, let's give it a try.

340
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,910
Just once.

341
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,480
It might actually help with your memory.

342
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,080
What if we get hurt?

343
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,790
Don't worry. I'm not afraid.

344
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,350
But I am.

345
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,080
I don't know martial arts now.

346
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,670
If we fell,

347
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,360
I couldn't protect you.

348
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm not the mighty warrior I used to be.

349
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,600
You must be disappointed.

350
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,080
Not at all.

351
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,840
You are worried I might get hurt.

352
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,760
I will never think of you as
a disappointment over this.

353
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,790
I'm more disappointed in myself.

354
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,430
I don't even have a way to restore

355
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,150
your memories.

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,960
Honestly...

357
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,240
I don't mind not having the memories.

358
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,600
I...

359
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,760
I don't mind at all.

360
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,550
Tan Er?

361
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,630
Tan Er?

362
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,120
What are you so obsessed with?

363
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:55,200
Is it me or your memories of the past?

364
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,510
Cheng Cheng, you should be in bed now.

365
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
Don't you like falling asleep

366
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,430
snuggling your darling?

367
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,670
I'm here to check on you.

368
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,790
I'll get going now.

369
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,390
What is it? Is something bothering you?

370
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,030
Is it because of your amnesia?

371
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,720
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

372
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,910
Let's work on it together, okay?

373
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,720
Right!

374
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,200
It's June 17.

375
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,840
It's the day we got married.

376
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,600
So it's our anniversary.

377
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,670
How do you want to celebrate it?

378
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll grant you any request.

379
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,270
Anniversary?

380
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,600
What about when you married me?

381
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,390
In that case,

382
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,270
we have three different anniversaries.

383
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,550
The first is on June 17.

384
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,760
The second is on October 26.

385
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,670
And now I married you again.

386
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,480
I will remember these dates.

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,550
These are important moments that we share.

388
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,630
You've had enough pampering. Now praise me.

389
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,600
But I don't remember the other two dates.

390
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,960
I don't want to celebrate those.

391
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,670
I only remember the day we got married.

392
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,910
Fine.

393
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,480
I won't force you if you don't want to.

394
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,840
We even have an adorable son.

395
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,200
His name is Xiao Yu Er.

396
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,550
He is such a lovely kid.

397
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,880
I'll draw you a picture of him.

400
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,600
Yu Er is cute.

401
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,360
He's not as ugly as this picture.

402
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,550
I miss him a lot.

403
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,310
I thought the picture would be
reminiscent of him.

404
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,910
But I overestimated my drawing skill.

405
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,760
I'm clumsy at drawing.

406
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,550
You could describe his look for me.

407
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,670
I'll give it a try.

408
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,270
Really?

409
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,200
I know you're better at this.

410
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,200
Yu Er's tiny face...

411
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,880
is chubby and pink.

412
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,910
He has big and upturned eyes,

413
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,270
much like yours.

414
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,630
If he has big eyes, he takes after you.

415
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,030
The resemblance is remarkable.

416
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,790
You're amazing.

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,120
He does look adorable.

418
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,880
<i>He's such a lovely child,</i>

419
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,480
<i>yet I remember nothing of him.</i>

420
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,200
<i>If he's not in my memory,</i>

421
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
<i>how can I claim to be his father?</i>

422
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,200
<i>Have I ever carried out the duty of a father?</i>

423
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,000
We have a beautiful son,

424
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,150
but his father

425
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,270
could only see him once every few days.

426
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,550
You were always busy with work.

427
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,310
I might as well raise him as a single parent.

428
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't really want to know

429
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,000
about the things I've never done.

430
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,480
Why are you upset again?

431
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,200
You're reluctant to do anything I ask.

432
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,880
I know you're in a bad mood.

433
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,510
So I put up with your attitude.

434
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,200
Isn't that enough?

435
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,880
It is.

436
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,120
I'm tired. I'm going back.

437
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,600
Why are you so gleeful?

438
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,270
Young Master.

439
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,270
I heard a quarrel

440
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,360
in the princess's room.

441
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,360
A quarrel?

442
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,310
Her Highness and Lian Cheng?

443
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,720
Who else could it be?

444
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,510
You should stay out of this.

445
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,510
Having a quarrel in the residence is never good.

446
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,080
Yes.

447
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,480
Her Highness is upset.

448
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
Whatever the cause is,

449
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,080
it's my duty to appease her as
the main prince consort.

450
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
Since others can't comply with her requests,

451
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,200
I must carry out my duty.

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,630
Every surprising and hair-raising moment
that we share

557
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,200
has fortified my love for you.

558
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,670
You don't need the memories.

559
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,840
Because we will create new memories

560
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,120
that belong to both of us.

561
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,870
♪Let's keep the memories of this lifetime♪

562
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:35,240
♪Your most wonderful moments
will forever remain in my heart♪

563
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,880
Let this kiss

564
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,150
be the first of our new memories.

565
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,910
Okay?

566
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,430
One isn't enough.

567
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,240
From tomorrow on,

568
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,430
I want my dear Cheng Cheng

569
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,000
to have more wonderful memories.

570
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,560
♪I couldn't step on the fallen blossoms♪

571
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,790
♪Our reunion and parting
will sink into the earth♪

572
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,880
♪Let's keep the memories of this lifetime♪

573
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,640
♪Your most wonderful moments
will forever remain in my heart♪

574
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,430
The weather today is nice.

575
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:38,910
Indeed.

576
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,120
This is part of our new memories.

577
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,390
Let's have a look there.

578
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,030
Sure.

579
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
The scenery is gorgeous.

580
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,480
It's great scenery with excellent feng shui.

581
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,790
It's worth purchasing as an investment.

582
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,030
By the way,

583
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,480
we haven't run a business together.

584
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,510
You never bothered

585
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,910
to invest in real estate with me.

586
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,200
You should invest in the love market.

587
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,840
We can turn this place into
a tourism destination.

588
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,880
We can make a fortune together

589
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,000
and use this chance to create

590
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
our own new memories.

591
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,240
Do you know how much this land costs?

592
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,910
How expensive could it be?

593
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,080
I'm the princess of Dongyue.

594
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,910
Can I not afford to buy a piece of land?

595
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
That much?

596
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,390
It's a lot.

597
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,120
But as princess, you can surely
afford to purchase it.

598
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,510
This memory is too pricey.

599
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
It's a lot to pay for.

600
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,000
Are you backing out now?

601
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,510
Never!

602
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,840
As long as we can create new memories together,

603
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,910
this is only a small price to pay!

604
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
All right, you don't need to buy it.

605
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,790
My instinct is telling me

606
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,790
if I don't spend the money,

607
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,080
you will think of me as a stingy person.

608
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,390
I don't want you to have leverage over me.

609
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,200
You really don't need to buy it.

610
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,310
That's because

611
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,270
I already have our precious memory.

612
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,840
Really?

613
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,200
Since you're great with words,

614
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,240
I won't mind if you say them more often.

615
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,430
For example,

616
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,430
between me and your money, you chose me,

617
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,600
while gnashing your teeth.

618
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,880
If we were in the past,

619
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,510
I wouldn't get to see you make this decision.

620
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,240
Choices are for the kids.

621
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,280
I want both love and money.

622
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,590
<i>Why can't you see it?</i>

623
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,430
<i>She doesn't care about you at all!</i>

624
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,000
<i>Otherwise,</i>

625
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,590
<i>she wouldn't turn a blind eye to your pain</i>

626
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,800
<i>or let you suffer in silence.</i>

627
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,910
Young Master, that's enough.

628
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,590
You are practicing so diligently

629
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,960
only to get her attention.

630
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
But what about her?

631
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,040
The two of them

632
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,000
have been out there alone for an entire day.

633
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,320
Tan Er likes my swordplay.

634
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,560
Leave me be.

635
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,150
Please stop.

636
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,720
You already excel at this.

637
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,040
It's not good enough!

638
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,280
She likes my swordplay to be bolder.

639
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,240
She likes the moves to be unrestrained.

640
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,520
If I become better,

641
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,040
she will start to like me!

642
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,390
She doesn't care about you at all!

643
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,590
<i>So Eighth Brother indeed did it on purpose.</i>

644
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,350
What? Are you disappointed?

Tan Er, you're finally here.

647
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,430
I'm here...

648
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,200
to tell you that...

649
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,070
Come closer, I can't hear you.

650
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,070
Say nothing. Please.

651
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,040
But...

652
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,430
Tan Er.

653
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,760
Who am I?

654
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,150
You're Mo Yan Chen.

655
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,350
I'm your prince consort, your husband.

656
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,070
You should show me affection.

657
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,910
Sorry, but I can't.

658
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,960
Why?

659
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,670
I never said it.

660
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,070
But it doesn't mean I don't want your love.

661
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,830
Tan Er.

662
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,240
You told me when you were a kid that you only

663
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,480
wanted Brother Yan Chen
to be your prince consort.

664
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Ever since then,

665
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,630
I wanted to be with you till the end of time.

666
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,240
But why are you ignoring me now?

667
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,430
Tan Er.

668
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,430
What did I do wrong to deserve this?

669
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,760
Why do you refuse even to touch me?

670
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,110
Yan Chen.

671
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,430
We should get a divorce.

672
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,110
Yan Chen...

673
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,590
You didn't say anything.

674
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,520
I didn't hear anything.

675
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,320
But that is what's best for the three of us.

676
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
I'm not disowning you.

677
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,720

But at this rate,

683
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,870
