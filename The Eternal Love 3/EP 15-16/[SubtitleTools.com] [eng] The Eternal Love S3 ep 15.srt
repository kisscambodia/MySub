<i>Episode 15</i>

17
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,360
How about it?

18
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,920
If I say

19
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,080
that I don't want him to leave,

20
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,440
even if that means putting on an act forever,

21
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,590
and spending the whole lifetime in a lie

22
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,000
to let him live in a dream,

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,640
would you be mad?

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,590
Did you say to him that you want a divorce?

25
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,870
I know how much he loves Qu Tan Er

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,440
and I know that if he thinks that

27
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,830
Qu Tan Er has abandoned him,

28
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,920
he would be in unendurable pain.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,200
I can't bear to see that.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,750
I know that

31
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,870
his kindness towards you

32
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
and towards me

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,280
was genuine.

34
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,440
If there is a way to keep up the lie forever,

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
so that he wouldn't be in pain,

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,230
I would gladly do it.

37
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,870
But no matter what choice we make,

38
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,670
we would be hurting him to no end.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,590
Perhaps since the moment the real Qu Tan Er

40
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,230
drowned and lost her life,

41
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,310
Eldest Brother was bound to get hurt.

42
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,470
But he doesn't know

43
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,470
that you're not the real Qu Tan Er.

44
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't blame yourself too much.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,390
But it was my arrival

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,870
that disrupted the peace.

47
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,080
Let's give him some time

48
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,280
and let him think about it calmly.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,030
We also need to think about it.

50
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
To think it through.

51
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,520
Go to rest now.

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,680
Okay.

53
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,120
Cheng Cheng.

54
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,470
These days, Yan Chen

55
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,200
pretends as if nothing has happened.

56
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,680
I don't know what to do.

57
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,920
Yan Chen.

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
During breakfast,

59
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,270
I saw that you were sweating a little.

60
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,590
So I thought that perhaps
your clothes were too thick

61
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
and asked a servant to fetch some thinner
clothing out of storage.

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,520
Yan Chen...

63
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,310
Alright.

64
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,470
I still need to verify the ledger of the residence.

65
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,920
You keep getting no salary as a punishment,

66
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,750
so I must be more careful with our money.

67
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,710
- Yan Chen.
- Eldest...

68
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,960
I'll put the clothes away.

69
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,200
He has chosen to lie to himself

70
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,150
and pretend that nothing ever happened.

71
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,200
Tan Er!

72
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
I was just about to bring you these desserts.

73
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,750
These are your favorite walnut and date delights.

74
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
I made them myself.

75
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,360
Yan Chen,

76
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
this is the divorce paper.

77
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,960
If you think there's something wrong with it,
please tell me.

78
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,270
I'm sorry.

79
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,120
You're really trying to take care of me
with your every word.

80
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,240
As long as I am willing to leave,

81
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,920
you can give me anything.

82
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,920
What would be wrong there?

83
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Yan Chen...

84
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,200
A divorce isn't appropriate.

85
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,470
Repudiation...

86
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,400
if you give me a repudiation paper,
I will leave.

87
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,990
But if I repudiate you,

88
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,270
your life would be even harder,

89
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,310
only a divorce can...

90
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,230
If you are going to abandon me,

91
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,160
then stop pretending to care about me!

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,720
The less of this ridiculous compensation
you give me,

93
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,990
the less sorrow and misery I feel.

94
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,350
As it currently stands,

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,870
I have no other choice.

96
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,520
I'm sorry. Please calm down.

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,670
No other choice?

98
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,750
I don't want to leave.

99
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
I was repudiated by you.

100
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,280
I will wait for you

101
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,990
to come to see me with the repudiation paper.

102
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,160
What else do you want to say?

103
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,790
Go ahead.

104
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,280
I can't explain it well,

105
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,910
but Qu Tan Er really did love you.

106
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,520
However, the current Second Princess isn't...

107
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,670
Even now,

108
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,280
you are still trying to meddle with my emotions.

109
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,480
I know

110
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,910
you won't believe in any of my explanations,

111
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,640
but the Qu Tan Er before loved you very much.

112
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,990
Of course I know that.

113
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,670
Of course I know

114
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,400
Tan Er's love for me was real.

115
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,550
If it weren't for you,

116
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,230
her feelings for me would always be real!

117
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,160
It was just an incident at the harem selection,

118
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,600
yet the next day she climbed over the fence
just to meet you.

119
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,160
The day before, you were the laughing stock of
the entire country for being unscrupulous.

120
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,110
The day after, you got her

121
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,110
to write a song about how morally sound you are.

122
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't tell me that

123
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,870
you had no one else to choose but her!

124
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,080
If you indeed had no feelings for her,

125
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,280
why would you choose someone
I treasured like this?

126
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,160
At that time,

127
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,160
I indeed had no feelings for her.

128
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,670
My mistake for realizing it so late.

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,990
I was using my own happiness to protect you

130
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,350
throughout all that has happened.

131
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,910
I cannot argue with that.

132
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,720
Perhaps since that moment,

133
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,400
all I can see is her.

134
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,870
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,230

the Mo Family's motto is to be faithful and bold,

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,080

poorly are not allowed in the residence.

please abide by the traditions.

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,870

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,200
Take good care of Eldest Brother.

185
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,280
Tell him, I know it's not his fault.

186
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,640
Yes.

187
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:49,660
<i>Mo Residence</i>

188
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,310
Why can't they take him in?

189
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,350
Isn't Feng Yang the head of the family?

190
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,790
Hasn't she always respected Yan Chen very much?

191
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,520
I heard that Feng Yang tried her best to stop
Yan Chen from cutting his hair to become a monk.

192
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,310
But Eldest Brother was afraid that his staying
would affect the Mo Family's reputation.

193
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,040
I originally thought that...

194
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,990
letting him go was the best option,

195
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,400
but who would have thought it'd come to this.

196
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,080
Cheng Cheng.

197
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,990
I wish that he could live a peaceful life.

198
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,240
Who is it?

199
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,080
Father.

200
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,430
Wait a moment.

201
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,430
Hurry and leave from the back door.

202
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,630
Continue to recruit soldiers
and purchase supplies.

203
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,080
But don't act rashly.

204
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,200
Follow my instructions.

205
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,760
Understood.

206
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,480
Come in.

207
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,550
If you have come here for your eldest brother,

208
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,670
then don't bother speaking.

209
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,030
Father, even if you had let Eldest Brother stay,

210
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,360
how much of an impact would it have on you?

211
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,910
Did you have to be so cruel?

212
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,080
I wanted to ask you.

213
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720
Why did you have to go that far?

214
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,150
Yan Chen being repudiated

215
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,270
will let Her Majesty think

216
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,000
that there's more to your marriage

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,910
than what was mentioned before.

218
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,550
Now that Her Majesty
grows suspicious of Second Princess,

219
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,600
the Mo family will look even more suspicious.

220
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Of course I need to ease that suspicion of hers.

221
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,550
Is Eldest Brother's situation

222
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,760
so unimportant to you?

223
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,430
Was it me who caused him to be in such a situation?

224
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,390
Cheng Er,

225
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,630
aren't you the cause of his misfortunes?

226
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,510
Since it has come to this,

227
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,510
and Second Princess is fully devoted to you,

228
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,840
you must make haste

229
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,840
and fulfill your responsibilities.

230
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,550
Father, please accept Eldest Brother
into the residence.

231
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,430
Cheng Er.

232
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,000
You knew very well that Yan Chen
and Second Princess are childhood friends,

233
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,240
yet you still robbed Yan Chen of his beloved.

234
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,390
Was it not you
who wanted to use Second Princess

235
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,790
to take the throne?

236
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,790
Was it not you who

237
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,430
came to me and spoke of your plan?

238
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,670
Have you forgotten about all that?

239
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,550
Indeed, it was me.

240
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,030
But I now have someone I wish to protect

241
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,270
and I have found a reason to not hurt the innocent.

242
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,000
Someone you wish to protect?

243
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,150
Very well.

244
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,910
Cheng Er.

245
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,910
Your mother carried this sword into battle
for many years.

246
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,840
I clean it carefully everyday

247
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,550
as I can't bear to see any dust on it.

248
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,030
Eagles don't catch flies.

249
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,390
Those with weak hearts can accomplish nothing.

250
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,120
Father, if so,

251
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,150
then I can no longer work alongside you.

252
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,720
I shall take my leave.
Forgive me for not being a filial son.

253
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,430
Cheng Er!

254
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,760
Your Majesty.

255
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,000
Has the repudiation of Mo Yan Chen cleared
the cloudiness in Your Majesty's mind?

256
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,120
I once thought that they were using each other
to each of their own benefits.

257
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,840
It is only now that I realize

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,720
if their relationship wasn't genuine,

259
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,430
why did she have to repudiate Mo Yan Chen?

260
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,240
Now that Qu Tan Er has abandoned
this childhood friend of hers,

261
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,480
then she will no longer bother

262
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,390
to put up an act in front of me.

263
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,390
Your health is of the utmost importance,
Your Majesty.

264
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,550
No matter what they do,

265
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,200
they cannot escape from
Your Majesty's arrangement,

266
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,510
so there's no need to worry.

267
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,670
Even if we met, you wouldn't recognize me now...

268
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,960
Forget it.

269
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,550
I worried too much before.

270
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,720
Qu Mei Er would not let this go.

271
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,840
She won't let Qu Tan Er

272
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,880
treat this as a private matter.

273
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,310
Let's see how this will go down.

274
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,550
Many thanks to Official Chen and Official Su

275
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,790
for your help.

276
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,670
Once we succeed,

277
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,030
I will not forget your loyalty to me.

278
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,600
Long live Your Highness.

279
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,670
Your Highness, chances like this are rare.

280
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,790
Tomorrow, we will ask to impeach

281
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,360
Second Princess in front of Her Majesty.

282
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,760
But...

283
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,120
But what?

284
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,910
Forgive my bluntness,

285
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,270
but the current situation is dire.

286
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,270
Your Highness, you must not

287
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,840
be held down by your personal feelings this time,

288
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,840
you must draw the line with Mo Yan Chen.

289
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,270
This is for the best.

290
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,270
Right.

291
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,720
If Your Highness were to be involved with
Mo Yan Chen right now,

292
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,270
then in Her Majesty's eyes, it would be immoral.

293
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,390
I fully understand your concern.

294
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,080
However, my Prince Consort will only be

295
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,880
Mo Yan Chen, whenever it is.

296
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,960
I hope you keep this in mind.

297
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,390
Yes, Your Highness.

298
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,270
Speak up. What is with these memorials?

299
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,880
Your Majesty.

300
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,080
Second Princess's Prince Consort,
Mo Lian Cheng,

301
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,960
has ignored all tradition and acted disrespectfully
toward those of higher status.

302
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Second Princess, being the head of the household,

303
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,430
not only has she not stopped him,

304
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,790
she hasn't fulfilled her duties either
and got carried away in her private life.

305
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,310
Furthermore, she repudiated her Main Prince Consort,
Mo Yan Chen, for no reason.

306
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,880
This is against cardinal guides
and constant virtues.

307
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,200
Is that really so?

308
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,030
Not a single word of lie, Your Majesty.

309
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,000
Your Majesty, according to Dongyue traditions,

310
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,760
after Mo Yan Chen was repudiated for no reason,

311
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,030
he suffered and was forced to
move into the memorial arch of chastity.

312
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,360
Second Princess being a princess,

313
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,390
is the foundation of our nation,
a descendant of the royal family.

314
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,270
But based on what she has done,

315
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,030
I recommend that she should be abolished.

316
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,270
Agreed.

317
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,630
I also agree.

318
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,480
I agree as well.

319
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,910
I, Qu Tan Er, am here to plead to Your Majesty.

320
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,630
Your Majesty, please clear Mo Yan Chen's name.

321
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,670
I would accept any punishment.

322
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,310
Call her in.

323
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,510
Greetings, Your Majesty.

324
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,720
Speak.

325
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,880
Now that Mo Yan Chen
was repudiated by me for no reason

326
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,510
and exiled to the memorial arch
of chastity to suffer.

327
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,720
Was it all my fault?

328
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,390
Second Princess repudiated him for no reason,
it is against order and morals.

329
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,240
Of course it is the fault of Second Princess.

330
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,430
That is correct, Official Chen.

331
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,080
If it is supposedly all my fault,

332
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,880
yet the victim is also suffering,

333
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,910
isn't that illogical?

334
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,390
Your Majesty,

335
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,150
I am at fault.

336
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,550
Therefore, the laws should be rewritten

337
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,360
to clear Mo Yan Chen's name.

338
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,310
Then, I will accept any punishment.

339
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,150
Qu Tan Er, if Her Majesty were to clear

340
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,200
Mo Yan Chen's name as you mentioned,

341
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,200
are you willing to take any punishment?

342
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,120
Of course.

343
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,510
So Eldest Princess,

344
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,150
do you think that Mo Yan Chen is innocent?

345
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
Of course Mo Yan Chen is innocent.

346
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,270
Everyone here knows it's true.

347
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,510
If so, then it is my plead to Your Majesty

348
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,510
to have a declaration made, so that innocent men
that were repudiated like Mo Yan Chen

349
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,720
can live a peaceful life.

350
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,080
Afterwards, I will accept
any punishment from Your Majesty

351
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,720
with no objection.

352
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,480
Since a conclusion has been made,

353
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,790
I will allow it.

354
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,760
Prepare to receive your punishments,
Second Princess.

355
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

356
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,660
<i>Princess's Residence</i>

357
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,600
Second Princess is grounded right now,

358
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,630
but she told me to bring these

359
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,120
to Eldest Young Master no matter what.

360
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,120
Oh.

361
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,240
Fourteenth Young Master,

362
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,840
how about I carry these for you?

363
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,080
As a woman, it is my responsibility.

364
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,760
Then I take half, and you take half.

365
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,510
Let's go.

366
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,600
Fourteenth Young Master,

367
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,360
when I taught you swordsmanship last time,

368
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,910
you said that I was cute.

369
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,430
If you don't like it,

370
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,080
then I'll never say it again!

371
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,080
But please don't be mad at me.

372
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,630
No, no, I'm not mad at you.

373
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,790
I'm a woman.

374
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,840
How can you say that I'm cute?

375
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,960
It's good to be cute.

376
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,360
Second Princess once told me,

377
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,390
to be cute, you must speak in reduplication.

378
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
Reduplication?

379
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,120
For example,

380
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,880
"eat food food", "take a nap nap", "so scared scared".

381
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,720
That sounds right.

382
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Reduplication?

383
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Then Fourteenth Young Master,

384
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,670
"hurry hurry" back to the "residence-dence".

385
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,840
Those "present-sents" are a bit heavy.

386
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,390
Be "careful careful".

387
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,270
When you come to visit the next time,

388
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,910
how about I teach you
"swordsmanship-ship" again?

389
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,270
Sounds good. I'll get going then.

390
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,510
Don't forget your promise of teaching me
"swordsmanship-ship".

391
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,120
But don't get "mad mad" at me

392
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,550
for being "clumsy clumsy".

393
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,000
Or else I'll be "depressed-pressed".

394
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
Then I'm leaving, Jing Xin Xin.

395
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,030
Fourteenth Young Master is way cuter than me.

396
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,790
Fourteenth "Young Master Master".

397
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,310
No, Fourteenth "Young Young Master".

398
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,120
Fourteenth Young...

399
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,760
Why is this reduplication thing so hard?

400
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Fourteenth Young...

401
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,240
Jing Xin Xin.

402
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,880
Your Majesty,

403
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,120
are you perhaps suspecting
that Second Princess' actions today

404
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,030
had something to do with Mo Yuan Long?

405
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,480
Since when did she care about laws?

406
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,670
She was definitely prepared for today.

407
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,630
It's just a matter of whether
Qu Tan Er and Mo Lian Cheng

408
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,910
are pawns of Mo Yuan Long

409
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,310
or his allies.

410
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,880
Eighth Young Master of the Mo family...

411
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,080
How about I go and investigate what they're up to?

412
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,630
Mo Lian Cheng has acted immorally.

413
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,270
Second Princess's Residence's conduct
needs to be rectified.

414
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,910
Get Su Yue La into the residence for rectification.

415
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,630
Understood.

416
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,880
I hope that Official Su
won't let Your Majesty down

417
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,000
and find the evidence

418
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
of Second Princess being beguiled
by Mo Yuan Long.

419
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,840
Second Princess.

420
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,670
Second Princess, Qu Tan Er, humbly accept the decree.

421
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,240
By the grace of heaven's will,
Her Majesty hereby proclaims...

422
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,790
Troubles have constantly arisen
in Second Princess's Residence.

423
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,270
Secondary Prince Consort, Mo Lian Cheng,
disrespected those of higher status.

424
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,550
Cardinal guides and constant virtues
were violated.

425
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,910
Second Princess, Qu Tan Er,
focused solely on her romantic relationships

426
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,960
and neglected her studies.

427
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,600
Thus, Her Majesty has mandated
Secretary of State, Su Yue La,

428
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,670
to supervise the rectification in the residence
so that all returns to normal.

429
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,390
That is all.

430
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,030
Second Princess, please accept the decree.

431
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,240
I humbly accept the decree.

432
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,430
Official Su.

433
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,430
You came in such grandeur.

434
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,430
Those who knew might think
you're here to pass on the decree,

435
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,080
those who didn't would think you're here
to confiscate the residence.

436
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,430
Official Su.

437
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,600
Second Princess has got a quick mouth.

438
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,910
Please forgive her, Official Su.

439
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,480
Official Su, may I ask

440
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,240
if all this rectification business

441
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,000
has a set time?

442
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,270
Such as, at what hour
do you enter the residence

443
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,720
and at what hour do you leave for the palace?

444
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,310
What Her Majesty intended is that

445
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,790
from now on, I no longer need to return to the palace.

446
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,200
Until I believe that

447
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,630
the cardinal guides
and constant virtues have been

448
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
reestablished in Second Princess's Residence.

449
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,630
You're staying?

450
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,240
She's planning to walk all over me, huh?

451
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,670
Jing Xin.

452
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
Settle Official Su down in a nice guest room

453
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,790
and prepare rooms
for the servants from the palace.

454
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,200
Yes.

455
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
It hasn't been long since the position of
Main Prince Consort has become vacant,

456
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,760
and you, Secondary Prince Consort,
have already taken charge of the household.

457
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,510
Official Su, it doesn't seem like you are here
to reestablish the guides and virtues,

458
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,080
but rather, it appears you're here for a fight.

459
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,510
I'm only here because of Her Majesty's orders.

460
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,510
Second Princess, I warn you not to
deduce Her Majesty's thoughts.

461
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,310
I think that Su Yue La

462
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,150
is just using the decree to make a show of force.

463
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,200
It's clear that

464
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,030
she's here to take her revenge

465
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,270
about her little brother losing out in
the harem selection.

466
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,200
Su Yue La is not hard to deal with,

467
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,120
but I'm afraid Her Majesty is behind this.

468
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,120
However, we have indeed been

469
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,030
a little high-key these days.

470
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,200
We've been out promoting
financial freedom for men

471
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,670
and promoting the freedom to divorce.

472
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,960
I think Her Majesty is warning us

473
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,510
to not try to usurp her power.

474
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,630
She's telling us to lay low.

475
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,510
If she wants to punish you,

476
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,120
she has other ways of doing it.

477
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,200
She definitely has something
she wants to investigate,

478
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,760
or else she didn't have to send an official
to stay over at the residence.

479
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,790
Well, in my opinion,

480
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,000
Her Majesty just wants to take you into her harem.

481
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,720
She sent Su Yue La here

482
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,080
to see whether

483
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,240
our bond is unbreakable

484
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,390
or as fragile as glass.

485
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,600
Kisses, hugs, and lift you high.

486
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,760
Why don't you tell me
if our bond is unbreakable or not?

487
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,600
Look at you, being a quick-learner.

488
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,080
We would need Su Yue La to help us

489
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,240
decipher the true intent of Her Majesty.

490
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,840
For now, we will deal with challenges
as they come up.

491
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,390
When the time is right,

492
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,880
she will let the cat out of the bag.

493
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,000
Then... where's my kiss?

494
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,840
You!

495
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,760
How can you do such a shameful act

496
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,670
under broad daylight?

497
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,960
And you call yourself a royal? How shameful!

498
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,630
It's Secondary Prince Consort's fault
for being so charming

499
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,520
that I couldn't resist him.

500
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,390
Very well.

501
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,800
It seems that Secondary Prince Consort
knows a lot about seduction techniques,

502
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,240
but nothing about the moral codes for men.

503
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,870
Our first lesson in etiquette

504
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,320
would be learning
Three Obediences and Four Virtues.

505
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,240
Men should comply by Three Obediences
in their lifetime.

506
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,630
None is their independence.

507
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,670
The unmarried shalt obey their mother.
The married shalt obey their wife.

508
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,150
The widowed shalt obey…

509
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,630
Secondary Prince Consort,
do you know what Four Virtues are?

510
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,110
Four Virtues are

511
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,630
ethics, speech,

512
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,910
visage, and skill.

513
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:34,110
A virtuous man should act
with dignity and politeness.

514
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,000
A virtuous household should be

515
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,830
tranquil and dignified,

516
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,560
modest and unsullied.

517
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
<i>Sand Vulture</i>
<i>*A slang which means "moron"</i>

518
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,390
How strange!

519
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,670
Why are there still mosquitoes
at this time of year?

520
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,430
Shoo shoo.

521
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,070
You have my thanks, Your Highness.

522
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,430
It's nothing. No need to thank me.

523
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,760
Then I'll continue...?

524
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,560
Go ahead.

525
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,240
A virtuous husband should act
with dignity and politeness.

526
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,480
A virtuous household should be

527
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,110
tranquil and dignified,

528
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,320
modest and unsullied.

529
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,040
Now let's talk about
the speech of a virtuous husband,

530
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,830
that is to not belittle, to not speak
with magniloquence, and to not double-tongue.

531
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,630
<i>idiot</i>
<i>*literally "Sand Vulture", means idiot</i>

532
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,720
With his wife...

533
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,860
Sand Vulture?

534
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,070
What's this?

535
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,630
This is the Prince Consort
complimenting Official Su.

536
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,430
You might not know this,

537
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
but it is said that

538
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,830
the "Sand Vulture" is a legendary beast.

539
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,480
People say that it has feathers
that shine like the golden sun.

540
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,960
It has a mighty body

541
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,350
that allows it to fly tirelessly
for thousands of miles.

542
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,000
In Prince Consort's heart,

543
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,560
Official Su, you are that big Sand Vulture!

544
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,830
Princess's order is the most important.

545
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,070
Wait a minute!

546
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,760
How can you touch the inkstone
with your bare hands

547
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,320
when grinding the inkstone?

548
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,800
You should wrap it with a piece of paper

549
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,000
as dirtying your hand with ink is unsightly.

550
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,720
Then let me check

551
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,350
if Prince Consort's hand

552
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,760
is dirtied with ink.

553
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,480
Those slender fingers of his are so fair.

554
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,760
Very well.

555
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,240
Then let me see if

556
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,720
any ink has gotten on

557
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,830
Prince Consort's cute little face.
