The medicine is not working at all?

17
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,440
Why didn't I think of him?

18
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,110
Since we're already here,

19
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
he might be here too.

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,630
Jing Xin, go out of town with me tomorrow.
I need to find someone.

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,520
To find someone?

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,110
If it's a physician you need,

23
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,360
you don't need to go in person.

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,550
I can get it done for you.

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,550
No.

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,630
The person I need...

27
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,270
is not someone

28
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,270
you can easily hire.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,670
Who is it?

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
You'll find out tomorrow.

31
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,190
Am I at the wrong place

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,910
or does this place get renovated?

33
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,600
This place is far from the city.

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,440
When did you come here before?

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,550
Let's go.

36
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,750
Black hair.

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Is this really Liu Qian Shui?
[*Literally means "streaming thousand water"]

38
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,180
(Hermit Liu)

39
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,030
Senior.

40
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,270
Excuse me...

41
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,440
Liu Qian Shui!

42
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,470
Please spare me, hero!

43
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,110
Could you give me a few more days?

44
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you here for fortune-telling

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,470
or exorcism?

46
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,360
Insolence!

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,110
She's the second princess of Dongyue!

48
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,080
Are you not going to greet her!

49
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,030
She's the second princess?

50
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,520
Then I'm the second prince!

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,880
Please, no!

52
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,480
I wasn't expecting Her Highness's arrival.

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
I apologize for my manner.

54
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,000
All right, Jing Xin.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,830
There is no need for violence.

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,510
Wait for me outside.

57
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,320
Fine.

58
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,760
What the...

59
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,510
You're like a coward.

60
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,720
You came here too?

61
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,880
I've always been here.

62
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,230
You've grown younger.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,640
Is this sorcery or did you dye your hair?

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
I wasn't old anyway.

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
True.

66
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,760
You're no ordinary man.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,950
You're a sage from Xuanling Continent.

68
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,790
It's been so long.

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
Some adjustments seem normal.

70
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,510
(So people are already spreading rumors
about my incredible power.)

71
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,270
As your leader,

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
the chief of the Qu Clan of Xuanling Continent

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
has a new mission for you.

74
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,390
Chief?

75
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,720
I made some analysis.

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,070
It was caused by an anomaly
of the Soul-guarding Bead.

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Am I still the host of Soul-guarding Beads?

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,880
(What is a Soul-guarding Pork?)
[*"Pork" sounds like "Bead" in Chinese]

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,350
(I've never tried that before.)

80
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,720
(How can she be a host of some pig?)

81
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,200
(Maybe she is just crazy.)

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,920
(I can put this fool to great use.)

83
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,640
Stop pretending.

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,950
There is no outsider around.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,110
Soul-guarding Bead.

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,920
The Xuanling Continent?

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,670
See? You do know the countersign.

88
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,670
Comrade Liu Qian Shui.

89
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,640
We finally meet again.

90
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,230
(Liu Qian Shui?)

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,760
But I'm Liu Bai Shui. Now with nine hundred more?
[Literally means "streaming hundred water"]

92
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,640
(Forget it. I won't be disadvantaged anyway.)

93
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,040
The way you put it

94
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,510
cleared all the doubt for me.

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,790
Fine, enough with the fancy words.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,510
Comrade Liu.

97
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,110
It's time to ditch your disguise.

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,110
I really need your help this time.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,600
You need my help?

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
You could have started with that.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,230
I, Liu Bai Shui, may not be a prodigy,

102
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,880
but I am

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,920
fairly knowledgeable in the field
of fortune-telling.

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,510
- I have the wisdom of Heaven and Earth...
- All right.

105
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,830
Yin Yang and...

106
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,200
I know you dyed your hair.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
But where did you get your accent?

108
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,550
Liu Bai Shui?

109
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,200
You're nine hundred short.

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
Forget it.

111
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,350
You can have whatever name you like.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,070
However, about the thing,

113
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,040
I need to tell you from the beginning.

114
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,620
(Hermit Liu can answer all your doubts.)

115
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,440
Do you understand

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
what I just told you?

117
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,760
(A parallel universe?)

118
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,920
(She is so hopeless.)

119
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,920
(It would be a pity not to make
a fortune out of her.)

120
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,950
Judging by what Your Highness said,

121
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,390
the secondary prince consort
certainly has amnesia.

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,350
But this could be problematic.

123
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,640
You can't do nothing either?

124
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,070
Then do you have the Soul-guarding Bead

125
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,070
and the Soul-parting Flute?

126
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,350
I could give it a try myself.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,790
I don't have them with me.

128
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,510
Can't you be more useful?

129
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,440
You don't have an idea or a magic item.

130
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,510
Or course, I have an idea.

131
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,760
There is a cure for it.

132
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,390
But the ingredients are very expensive

133
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,550
and it's hard to find.

134
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,640
It might require a hefty sum of money.

135
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,550
So you need money.

136
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,070
That's easy.

137
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,830
Look.

138
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,270
I must first travel to Beixuan

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,670
to acquire a herb.

140
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,790
That journey alone

141
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,550
could be very costly.

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,110
A hundred taels should be enough, right?

143
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,110
Yes.

144
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,670
That's enough for the first ingredient.

145
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,760
As for the second ingredient,

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,390
I must go to Nanlu to procure it.

147
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,550
That trip could cost me

148
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,600
quite a fortune.

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
Fine. Here you are.

150
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,950
All right.

151
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,880
As for the third ingredient,

152
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,950
which is also the most crucial of all,

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,880
I must travel

154
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,110
to Xiyue instead.

155
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,350
Trust me.

156
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,670
I will require

157
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,030
several Ferghana horses on my journey

158
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,080
to find the third herb before the next spring.

159
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,000
The next spring?

160
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,000
That won't do.

161
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,110
How much do you need?

162
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,230
Just get to the point.

163
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Sure.

164
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,910
I'll give you a straight answer.

165
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,350
Look.

166
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,440
The truth is...

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
After we've combined the several main herbs

168
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,910
of this prescription,

169
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,350
the rest of the ingredients

170
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,550
are easy to find.

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,350
The other

172
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,910
ingredients are things, such as

173
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
millennial ginseng,

174
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,230
knotweed,

175
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
and old Ganoderma fungi

176
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,840
that grows on cliffs.

177
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,640
Right!

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,550
The most important ingredient of all

179
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,840
might require me to go to...

180
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,550
Xuan...

181
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,230
Wait.

182
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
The Xuanling Continent.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,030
After I get there, we'll have all the ingredients

184
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,640
to make the medicine.

185
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,000
Fine.

186
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,320
You can keep all the money.

187
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,400
Feel free to let me know if you need more.

188
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,840
I think it's enough for now.

189
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,230
Judging by Your Highness's heartfelt story,

190
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,080
it seems like.

191
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,550
Your Highness's love for the secondary
prince consort is true.

192
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm sure you will find happiness together.

193
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,840
So don't worry.

194
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
You paid me well.

195
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,790
I will do whatever within my capability
to realize your goal.

196
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,080
I don't need your flattery.

197
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,960
But I need to know.

198
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,710
How long is it going to take
to collect all the herbs?

199
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,760
I think it's around...

200
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,230
July and August,

201
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,000
ten days to run and hide...

202
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,470
It should take a month or so.

203
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
That's too long!

204
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,670
I need it done as soon as possible.

205
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,230
Do you have another way?

206
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
More haste, less speed.

207
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,790
I will need more time to brew the medicine.

208
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,350
Trust me.

209
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,200
These herbs have unique features and they

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,350
conflict with each other.

211
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,400
The slightest error in the brewing

212
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,790
will cause devastating consequences.

213
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,080
So you must be patient.

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,230
Fine.

215
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,670
But get it done as soon as you can.

216
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,320
Sure.

217
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,150
One more thing.

218
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,280
Use the

219
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,670
finest herbs for this medicine you'll be making.

220
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,350
Money is not an issue here.

221
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
I assure you.

222
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,230
I will spend

223
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,470
every penny you paid me.

224
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,550
Very well. That settles it for now.

225
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,230
I'm counting on you.

226
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,080
Don't mention it.

227
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,710
I should get going.

228
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,790
Jing Xin, let's go.

229
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,550
Your Highness,

230
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,590
have a nice day!

231
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,110
So she is the future crown princess of Dongyue.

232
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
The country is doomed.

233
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,840
Forget it.

234
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,080
Even with all this money,

235
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,110
her sickness is hopeless.

236
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,660
(Princess's Residence)

237
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
What is going on?

238
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,000
Your Highness, it's Official Su.

239
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,150
Let's check it out.

240
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been expecting you, Your Highness.

241
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,470
Second Princess Qu Tan Er, heed this decree.

242
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,320
As written in this imperial order,

243
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,440
Her Majesty has great expectations
for Second Princess Qu Tan Er.

244
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,550
Thus, the princess's capability shall be tested,

245
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,670
so she can be take up the right position

246
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,840
to serve Her Majesty and the country
as soon as possible.

247
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,440
The end.

248
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,910
I accept the imperial order.

249
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,550
Your Highness has three days.

250
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,350
Her Majesty

251
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,280
has given Your Highness time
for proper preparation.

252
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,880
I hope Your Highness lives up to the expectation.

253
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,910
I should take my leave now.

254
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,110
Jing Xin.

255
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,760
You're a knowledgeable person

256
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,200
and have mastered many art forms.

257
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,230
This is a great

258
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,440
opportunity for you to prove your worth.

259
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,710
Eldest Brother, you're right.

260
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,400
I wish you all the best, Your Highness.

261
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,670
Am I really that amazing to you?

262
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,200
I hope you're right about me.

263
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,470
I need some time to process this.

264
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
A fine cup of tea.

265
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,200
Official Su has contributed much to the country.

266
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,150
It's a token of goodwill.

267
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,000
I hope you like it.

268
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,520
I will gladly accept Your Highness's kindness.

269
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,440
You were at the second princess's residence
to send the imperial order.

270
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,470
Was everyone at the scene?

271
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,030
Mo Yan Chen is doing well.

272
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,470
Your Highness has nothing to worry about.

273
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,350
How can he be well?

274
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,550
He gave his heart to Qu Tan Er.

275
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,670
Yet she never answered his love.

276
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,350
As soon as Your Highness rises to power,

277
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,080
Prince Yan Chen will certainly...

278
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,640
Mi Xue.

279
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,200
I want to be more than just his aide.

280
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,400
Your Highness is loyal,

281
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,320
not to mention ambitious.

282
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,080
But there is one thing I don't understand.

283
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I hope Your Highness doesn't find it offensive.

284
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,790
Official Su, you're one of us.

285
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,960
Do tell.

286
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,590
You went out of your way to make this test happen.

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,710
If Qu Tan Er actually passed the test,

288
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,200
wouldn't your effort end up helping the enemy?

289
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,840
I had taken that into account.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,840
Whether Qu Tan Er passes the test or not,

291
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,710
it won't end well for her.

292
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,670
I don't understand.

293
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,670
If she passed the test,

294
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,760
Her Majesty would be warier of her.

295
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
But if she failed,

296
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,230
it would be evident to Her Majesty

297
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,790
that she is not worthy of being the crown princess.

298
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,080
Your Highness is very tactful indeed.

299
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,960
Impressive.

300
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,200
In that case,

301
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,910
I must send the message to Her Majesty.

302
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,710
I've taken enough of your time.

303
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,760
Mi Xue, see Official Su off.

304
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,910
This way, please.

305
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,960
This is bad.

306
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,640
Why are they going to test me all of a sudden?

307
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,670
What should I do?

308
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,960
I should malinger.

309
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,350
Yes, I should malinger.

310
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,400
Tan.

311
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,550
Tan? What's wrong?

312
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,960
Jing Xin!

313
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,230
Jing Xin, tell Her Majesty now.

314
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,230
I'm ill. I'm in great pain.

315
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,790
I'm afraid I can't visit the palace for now.

316
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,910
Are you faking it?

317
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,400
Was it so obvious?

318
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,470
If you informed Her Majesty,

319
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,350
she would send an imperial physician here.

320
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,440
Would you be able to fool the physician
Her Majesty sent?

321
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,670
This is treachery against the empress.
Are you sure about this?

322
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,550
No way!

323
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,350
No.

324
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,950
I should go into hiding for a couple of days.

325
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,830
Jing Xin, I leave everyone here in your care.

326
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,560
Keep them safe for me.

327
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,040
I must start

328
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,430
packing my belongings now.

329
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,560
Tan! Wait.

330
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,110
Jing Xin, give us some privacy.

331
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,950
I need to have a word with the second princess.

332
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,590
Do you really think you can run away?

333
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,520
What else can I do now?

334
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,920
Everyone here knows that

335
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,920
Qu Tan Er is a knowledgeable person.

336
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,000
I can usually get away by acting smart.

337
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,760
But in a real test...

338
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,040
There is no way I could fool anyone!

339
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,000
I must leave now.

340
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,470
So you know your own flaw.

341
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,400
Am I doing this for myself?

342
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,160
If they saw through my identity,

343
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,520
you would be in deep trouble again.

344
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,160
But since you choose to come here now,

345
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
are you going to elope with me?

346
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,310
If you want to elope, you should
elope with someone else.

347
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,880
But if you want to fool everyone,

348
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,640
come with me to the study.

349
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,400
The study?

350
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,070
Can't we elope to somewhere else?

351
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,920
This is Qu Tan Er's handwriting.

352
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,470
How do you know?

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,040
I read her letters.

354
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,590
Plenty of them.

355
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,280
She wrote them to a worthless friend.

356
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,230
So I know her handwriting very well.

357
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,950
These are

358
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,470
indeed letters and poems written

359
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,880
by Qu Tan Er.

360
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,470
What I need from you

361
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,710
is to copy her handwriting

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,280
as much as you can before the test.

363
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,350
In case Her Majesty wants to conduct any written tests.

364
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,950
But there are so many words.

365
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,760
How can I possibly do it in three days?

366
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,520
I bet I couldn't copy even a word.

367
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,040
One word is all you need.

368
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,710
The word "Yong" is all you need to mimic.
[*"Yong" means "forever"]

369
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,350
That's all?

370
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,310
Whatever Her Majesty wants,

371
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,920
I must only write the word "Yong"?

372
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,950
Are you serious about this?

373
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,470
The word

374
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,430
contains all the common strokes
we need for calligraphy.

375
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,710
When we learn how to write,

376
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
we start by practicing with this word.

377
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,280
If you master this word,

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,470
you can basically write any word.

379
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,640
If there is any suspicion,

380
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,710
you can always say it's your hasty handwriting.

381
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,470
This is still very tedious,

382
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,070
but it's much simpler than I thought.

383
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,280
Fine. I can do it.

384
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,710
Go for it.

385
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,760
As long as I have you with me,

386
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,640
I can master it in no time.

387
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,280
This is the power of love.

388
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,710
You should start practicing now.

389
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Every four hours,

390
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,070
I'll have Jing Xin

391
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,160
send your handwriting to my study.

392
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,590
I'll send them back after marking.

393
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,590
Why?

394
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,040
If you stay with me,

395
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,680
you can supervise me at all times.

396
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,640
I must keep this a secret from my eldest brother.

397
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,110
If he found out

398
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,800
you're not the real Qu Tan Er,

399
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,190
your life would be in danger.

400
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,520
So you must practice in seclusion.

401
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,470
Other than Jing Xin,

402
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,230
no one is allowed to visit you.

403
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,800
At least show me how to write one word.

404
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,140
(Yong)

405
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,760
Amazing.

406
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,070
It's the same as her handwriting.

407
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,800
I'll give it a try.

408
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,860
(Yong)

409
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,460
(Yong)

410
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,430
Here.

411
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,780

♪From a full moon to a new moon,

413
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,160
Press downward, but don't overdo it.

414
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,470
A stroke across like a short leash.

415
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
A vertical stroke with an elegant curve.

416
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,880
A stroke across like a short leash.

417
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,470
Slow down. I didn't catch that.

418
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:55,350
♪I will never stop waiting for your return♪

419
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,680
♪We'll wander the land together,

420
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:09,200
♪In your journey, I'll never be lonely♪

421
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,520
That's all for the lesson.

422
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,680
You should practice on your own.

423
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,950
I don't want to be executed over this.

424
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,920
♪Zhuangzi said love was the butterfly's secret♪

425

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,700

♪We can say, love, love, love, love♪

435
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,950
(The word has the right form.)

436
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,400
(I can't accompany you tomorrow.)

437
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,710
(I wish you all the best.)

438
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,830
(I love Cheng Cheng, forever and always)
(It's been a long day. Rest well.)

439
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,560
I thought this was a test.

440
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
Why am I at the training ground?

441
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:06,950
Your Highness.

442
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,760
The test is a martial art test,

443
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
not a written test.

444
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,190
That means my practice for the past few days

445
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,400
was a waste of time.

446
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,710
I don't know martial arts.

447
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,040
How can I take the test?

448
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,760
I don't have an answer for that.

449
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,590
Your Highness.

450
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,430
Message from Her Majesty.

451
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,400
As a princess of our country,

452
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,760
it's your duty to devote your life
to the benefit of Dongyue.

453
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,680
The test today

454
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,040
is to determine whether Your Highness
has a strong physique

455
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,400
and whether you can shoulder
great responsibilities.

456
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,640
(It's just a physical test.)

457
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,640
(As a former real estate agent
who ran around the city,)

458
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,920
(my stamina must be above average.)

459
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,000
I understand.

460
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,160
I will do my best.

461
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,920
These are bows with draw weights

462
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,280
of one dan, three dan, and nine dan.
[*One dan equals 120 catties]

463
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
You may start with the lowest draw weight.

464
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,190
We'll see how much draw weight is your limit.

465
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,400
This is a test of your arm strength.

466
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,310
This should be a walk in the park.

467
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,760
Cheng Cheng taught me this.

468
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,760
I can draw a bow all right.

469
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,040
Hitting the bullseye

470
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,880
won't even be a problem.

471
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,760
(No.)

472
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,710
(Tan Er was frail.)

473
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,920
(Her Majesty knows that.)

474
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,590
(These tasks are easy for me.)

475
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,040
(But if I do it too well,)

476
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,760
(it draws nothing but suspicion.)

477
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,280
Official.

478
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,640
Even the lowest draw weight is too much for me.

479
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,230
I can't even pull the string.

480
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,350
Next.

481
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,830
Your Highness.

482
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,760
Please.

483
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,760
I can't handle it.

484
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,710
That hurts a lot.

485
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,920
That's all for today.

486
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,920
The joy of a newlywed hasn't worn off,

487
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,920
so I lack the necessary practice.

488
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm sorry for being such a letdown.

489
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,310
Message from Her Majesty.

490
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,760
Your Highness must come to the palace
to practice every day.

491
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,520
Your next attempt will be in ten days.

492
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,070
Why can't Her Majesty give up on me?

493
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,880
I have to go to the palace every day?

494
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,160
I didn't catch that.

495
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,950
I mean I'll not disappoint Her Majesty again.

496
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,540
(Princess's Residence)

497
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,430
Tan.

498
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,070
How did the test go

499
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,040
with your handwriting?

500
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
Forget about it.

501
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,590
Jing Xin, you may leave now.

502
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,800
How did it go?

503
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,590
There was no written test.

504
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,590
But there was a physical test.

505
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,760
I messed up.

506
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,230
I saw how you went over the wall.

507
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,280
Your strength is on par with the other women,

508
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,830
perhaps it's even better.

509
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
You did this on purpose.

510
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,230
You saw me went over the wall

511
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,710
so you think I'm strong.

512
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,000
Do you want to find out

513
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,000
what I'm really capable of?

514
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,560
That won't be necessary.

515
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,070
Please enlighten me.

516
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,350
Why did you act like a weakling?

517
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,350
Since you know me so well,

518
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,950
why not have a guess?

519
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,350
That was because you knew

520
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,880
you were much muscular than the real Qu Tan Er.

521
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,920
To avoid suspicion,

522
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
you would rather fail the test

523
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,110
by pretending to be frail.

524
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,470
Muscular?

525
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,590
I'm muscular?

526
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
If that's how you see me,

527
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,230
I'll stop liking you!

528
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,880
Aren't you afraid of losing my favor?

529
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,520
But the way you improvised

530
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,470
was impressive.

531
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,350
I had underestimated you.

532
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,680
There are more you haven't seen!

533
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,920
We have the time.

534
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,800
You will discover my strength over time.

535
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,710
No.

536
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,070
What?

537
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,710
What was the purpose of this test?

538
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,590
They said I needed a strong body
to take on great responsibilities.

539
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,000
That's about it.

540
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
What responsibilities...

541
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,640
would require you to have a strong physique?

542
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,400
The test could have been...

543
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,280
about national affairs or military tactics.

544
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Those are more reasonable.

545
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,150
But they went out of their way

546
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,230
only to find out whether you're strong enough.

547
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,470
Isn't that strange to you?

548
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,630
What do you think the purpose is?

549
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,080
I have no clue now.

550
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,950
But this is worrying.

551
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,470
You care a lot about me.

552
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,840
You took it wrongly.

553
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,470
I'm not the other guy.

554
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,760
You clearly care a lot about me.

555
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,870
Your cold shoulder is just a bluff.

556
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,840
My dear Cheng Cheng never let me down.

557
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,950
I can't wait to prove you wrong.

558
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
A physical test?

559
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,760
Qu Tan Er has always been frail.

560
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,040
Her Majesty knows that.

561
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,280
But a physical test...

562
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,430
Was it meant to embarrass her?

563
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,040
Is Her Majesty upset?

564
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,120
Was the princess punished?

565
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,800
You can consider it a punishment.

566
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,710
But it's weird.

567
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,040
It's weird? How so?

568
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,190
Her Majesty ordered the second princess to
practice every day at the palace.

569
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,670
Practice?

570
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,800
Her Majesty ordered only her to go to
the palace and practice.

571
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,230
It's as if

572
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,190
she is being trained to become
the next crown princess.

573
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,470
Your Highness, don't worry.

574
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,120
That might not be Her Majesty's plan.

575
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,360
Perhaps this was a warning for her.

576
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,190
Even if that wasn't the intention,

577
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,670
when the officers share this speculation,

578
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,430
those who are still wavering

579
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,040
would side with Qu Tan Er.

580
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,870
Then it's time to take action, Your Highness.

581
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,910
Your Majesty, please don't be upset.

582
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,150
The second princess lacks training.

583
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,670
She wasn't born with any defect.

584
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,390
That is true,

585
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,120
but she is too weak.

586
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,120
Her frail body

587
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,280
is not fit to serve me.

588
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,710
Now is the opportunity

589
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,040
to have her in the palace.

590
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,390
We'll slowly nourish her without her noticing,

591
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,630
so she can take over your duties.

592
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
I don't want to

593
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,080
place my hope on others either.

594
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,150
The altar requires great power.

595
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
Destiny waits for no one.

596
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,800
We have many farmlands.

597
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,630
An adequate increment in taxation

598
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,470
will resolve the funding problems.

599
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,870
I will see to it myself. Your Majesty
shouldn't be worried.

600
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,150
I have faith in you.

601
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,470
But my health has been deteriorating.

602
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,040
I hope Tan Er doesn't fall short.

603
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,600
When I need her to succeed the throne,

604
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,560
she must prove her worth to the imperial officers.
