The medicine is not working at all?

17
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,740
Why didn't I think of him?

18
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,410
Since we're already here,

19
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,100
he might be here too.

20
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,930
Jing Xin, go out of town with me tomorrow.
I need to find someone.

21
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,820
To find someone?

22
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,410
If it's a physician you need,

23
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,660
you don't need to go in person.

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,850
I can get it done for you.

25
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,850
No.

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,930
The person I need...

27
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,570
is not someone

28
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,570
you can easily hire.

29
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,970
Who is it?

30
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,620
You'll find out tomorrow.

31
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,490
Am I at the wrong place

32
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,210
or does this place get renovated?

33
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,900
This place is far from the city.

34
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,740
When did you come here before?

35
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:21,850
Let's go.

36
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,050
Black hair.

37
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,660
Is this really Liu Qian Shui?
[*Literally means "streaming thousand water"]

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,480
(Hermit Liu)

39
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,330
Senior.

40
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,570
Excuse me...

41
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,740
Liu Qian Shui!

42
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,770
Please spare me, hero!

43
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,410
Could you give me a few more days?

44
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,300
Are you here for fortune-telling

45
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,770
or exorcism?

46
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,660
Insolence!

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,410
She's the second princess of Dongyue!

48
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,380
Are you not going to greet her!

49
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,330
She's the second princess?

50
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,820
Then I'm the second prince!

51
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,180
Please, no!

52
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,780
I wasn't expecting Her Highness's arrival.

53
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,180
I apologize for my manner.

54
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,300
All right, Jing Xin.

55
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,130
There is no need for violence.

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,810
Wait for me outside.

57
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,620
Fine.

58
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,060
What the...

59
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,810
You're like a coward.

60
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,020
You came here too?

61
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,180
I've always been here.

62
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,530
You've grown younger.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,940
Is this sorcery or did you dye your hair?

64
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,020
I wasn't old anyway.

65
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,340
True.

66
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,060
You're no ordinary man.

67
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,250
You're a sage from Xuanling Continent.

68
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,090
It's been so long.

69
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,180
Some adjustments seem normal.

70
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,810
(So people are already spreading rumors
about my incredible power.)

71
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,570
As your leader,

72
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,940
the chief of the Qu Clan of Xuanling Continent

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,220
has a new mission for you.

74
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,690
Chief?

75
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,020
I made some analysis.

76
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,370
It was caused by an anomaly
of the Soul-guarding Bead.

77
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,740
Am I still the host of Soul-guarding Beads?

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,180
(What is a Soul-guarding Pork?)
[*"Pork" sounds like "Bead" in Chinese]

79
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,650
(I've never tried that before.)

80
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,020
(How can she be a host of some pig?)

81
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,500
(Maybe she is just crazy.)

82
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,220
(I can put this fool to great use.)

83
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,940
Stop pretending.

84
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,250
There is no outsider around.

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,410
Soul-guarding Bead.

86
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,220
The Xuanling Continent?

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,970
See? You do know the countersign.

88
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,970
Comrade Liu Qian Shui.

89
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,940
We finally meet again.

90
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,530
(Liu Qian Shui?)

91
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,060
But I'm Liu Bai Shui. Now with nine hundred more?
[Literally means "streaming hundred water"]

92
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,940
(Forget it. I won't be disadvantaged anyway.)

93
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,340
The way you put it

94
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,810
cleared all the doubt for me.

95
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,090
Fine, enough with the fancy words.

96
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,810
Comrade Liu.

97
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,410
It's time to ditch your disguise.

98
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,410
I really need your help this time.

99
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,900
You need my help?

100
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,500
You could have started with that.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,530
I, Liu Bai Shui, may not be a prodigy,

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,180
but I am

103
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,220
fairly knowledgeable in the field
of fortune-telling.

104
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,810
- I have the wisdom of Heaven and Earth...
- All right.

105
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,130
Yin Yang and...

106
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,500
I know you dyed your hair.

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,220
But where did you get your accent?

108
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,850
Liu Bai Shui?

109
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,500
You're nine hundred short.

110
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,900
Forget it.

111
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,650
You can have whatever name you like.

112
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,370
However, about the thing,

113
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,340
I need to tell you from the beginning.

114
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,920
(Hermit Liu can answer all your doubts.)

115
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,740
Do you understand

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,180
what I just told you?

117
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,060
(A parallel universe?)

118
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,220
(She is so hopeless.)

119
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,220
(It would be a pity not to make
a fortune out of her.)

120
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,250
Judging by what Your Highness said,

121
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,690
the secondary prince consort
certainly has amnesia.

122
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,650
But this could be problematic.

123
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,940
You can't do nothing either?

124
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,370
Then do you have the Soul-guarding Bead

125
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,370
and the Soul-parting Flute?

126
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,650
I could give it a try myself.

127
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,090
I don't have them with me.

128
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,810
Can't you be more useful?

129
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,740
You don't have an idea or a magic item.

130
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,810
Or course, I have an idea.

131
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,060
There is a cure for it.

132
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,690
But the ingredients are very expensive

133
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,850
and it's hard to find.

134
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,940
It might require a hefty sum of money.

135
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,850
So you need money.

136
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,370
That's easy.

137
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,130
Look.

138
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,570
I must first travel to Beixuan

139
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,970
to acquire a herb.

140
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,090
That journey alone

141
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,850
could be very costly.

142
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,410
A hundred taels should be enough, right?

143
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,410
Yes.

144
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,970
That's enough for the first ingredient.

145
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,060
As for the second ingredient,

146
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,690
I must go to Nanlu to procure it.

147
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,850
That trip could cost me

148
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,900
quite a fortune.

149
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,780
Fine. Here you are.

150
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,250
All right.

151
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,180
As for the third ingredient,

152
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,250
which is also the most crucial of all,

153
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,180
I must travel

154
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,410
to Xiyue instead.

155
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,650
Trust me.

156
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,970
I will require

157
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,330
several Ferghana horses on my journey

158
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,380
to find the third herb before the next spring.

159
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,300
The next spring?

160
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,300
That won't do.

161
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,410
How much do you need?

162
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,530
Just get to the point.

163
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,060
Sure.

164
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,210
I'll give you a straight answer.

165
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,650
Look.

166
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,740
The truth is...

167
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,940
After we've combined the several main herbs

168
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,210
of this prescription,

169
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,650
the rest of the ingredients

170
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,850
are easy to find.

171
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,650
The other

172
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,210
ingredients are things, such as

173
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,500
millennial ginseng,

174
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,530
knotweed,

175
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
and old Ganoderma fungi

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,140
that grows on cliffs.

177
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:22,940
Right!

178
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,850
The most important ingredient of all

179
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,140
might require me to go to...

180
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,850
Xuan...

181
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,530
Wait.

182
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,300
The Xuanling Continent.

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,330
After I get there, we'll have all the ingredients

184
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,940
to make the medicine.

185
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,300
Fine.

186
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,620
You can keep all the money.

187
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,700
Feel free to let me know if you need more.

188
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,140
I think it's enough for now.

189
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,530
Judging by Your Highness's heartfelt story,

190
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,380
it seems like.

191
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,850
Your Highness's love for the secondary
prince consort is true.

192
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,380
I'm sure you will find happiness together.

193
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,140
So don't worry.

194
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,180
You paid me well.

195
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,090
I will do whatever within my capability
to realize your goal.

196
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,380
I don't need your flattery.

197
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,260
But I need to know.

198
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,010
How long is it going to take
to collect all the herbs?

199
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,060
I think it's around...

200
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,530
July and August,

201
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,300
ten days to run and hide...

202
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,770
It should take a month or so.

203
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
That's too long!

204
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,970
I need it done as soon as possible.

205
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,530
Do you have another way?

206
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,500
More haste, less speed.

207
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,090
I will need more time to brew the medicine.

208
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,650
Trust me.

209
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,500
These herbs have unique features and they

210
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,650
conflict with each other.

211
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,700
The slightest error in the brewing

212
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,090
will cause devastating consequences.

213
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,380
So you must be patient.

214
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,530
Fine.

215
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,970
But get it done as soon as you can.

216
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,620
Sure.

217
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,450
One more thing.

218
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,580
Use the

219
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,970
finest herbs for this medicine you'll be making.

220
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,650
Money is not an issue here.

221
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,380
I assure you.

222
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,530
I will spend

223
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,770
every penny you paid me.

224
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,850
Very well. That settles it for now.

225
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,530
I'm counting on you.

226
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,380
Don't mention it.

227
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,010
I should get going.

228
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,090
Jing Xin, let's go.

229
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,850
Your Highness,

230
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,890
have a nice day!

231
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,410
So she is the future crown princess of Dongyue.

232
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,260
The country is doomed.

233
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,140
Forget it.

234
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,380
Even with all this money,

235
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,410
her sickness is hopeless.

236
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,960
(Princess's Residence)

237
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
What is going on?

238
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,300
Your Highness, it's Official Su.

239
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,450
Let's check it out.

240
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,300
I've been expecting you, Your Highness.

241
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,770
Second Princess Qu Tan Er, heed this decree.

242
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,620
As written in this imperial order,

243
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,740
Her Majesty has great expectations
for Second Princess Qu Tan Er.

244
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,850
Thus, the princess's capability shall be tested,

245
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,970
so she can be take up the right position

246
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,140
to serve Her Majesty and the country
as soon as possible.

247
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,740
The end.

248
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,210
I accept the imperial order.

249
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,850
Your Highness has three days.

250
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,650
Her Majesty

251
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,580
has given Your Highness time
for proper preparation.

252
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,180
I hope Your Highness lives up to the expectation.

253
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,210
I should take my leave now.

254
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,410
Jing Xin.

255
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,060
You're a knowledgeable person

256
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,500
and have mastered many art forms.

257
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,530
This is a great

258
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,740
opportunity for you to prove your worth.

259
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,010
Eldest Brother, you're right.

260
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,700
I wish you all the best, Your Highness.

261
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,970
Am I really that amazing to you?

262
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,500
I hope you're right about me.

263
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,770
I need some time to process this.

264
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,300
A fine cup of tea.

265
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,500
Official Su has contributed much to the country.

266
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,450
It's a token of goodwill.

267
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,300
I hope you like it.

268
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,820
I will gladly accept Your Highness's kindness.

269
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,740
You were at the second princess's residence
to send the imperial order.

270
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,770
Was everyone at the scene?

271
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,330
Mo Yan Chen is doing well.

272
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,770
Your Highness has nothing to worry about.

273
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,650
How can he be well?

274
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,850
He gave his heart to Qu Tan Er.

275
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,970
Yet she never answered his love.

276
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,650
As soon as Your Highness rises to power,

277
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,380
Prince Yan Chen will certainly...

278
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,940
Mi Xue.

279
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,500
I want to be more than just his aide.

280
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,700
Your Highness is loyal,

281
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,620
not to mention ambitious.

282
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,380
But there is one thing I don't understand.

283
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,140
I hope Your Highness doesn't find it offensive.

284
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,090
Official Su, you're one of us.

285
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,260
Do tell.

286
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,890
You went out of your way to make this test happen.

287
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,010
If Qu Tan Er actually passed the test,

288
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,500
wouldn't your effort end up helping the enemy?

289
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,140
I had taken that into account.

290
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,140
Whether Qu Tan Er passes the test or not,

291
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,010
it won't end well for her.

292
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,970
I don't understand.

293
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,970
If she passed the test,

294
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,060
Her Majesty would be warier of her.

295
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,500
But if she failed,

296
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,530
it would be evident to Her Majesty

297
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,090
that she is not worthy of being the crown princess.

298
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,380
Your Highness is very tactful indeed.

299
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,260
Impressive.

300
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,500
In that case,

301
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,210
I must send the message to Her Majesty.

302
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,010
I've taken enough of your time.

303
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,060
Mi Xue, see Official Su off.

304
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,210
This way, please.

305
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,260
This is bad.

306
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,940
Why are they going to test me all of a sudden?

307
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,970
What should I do?

308
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,260
I should malinger.

309
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,650
Yes, I should malinger.

310
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,700
Tan.

311
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,850
Tan? What's wrong?

312
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,260
Jing Xin!

313
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,530
Jing Xin, tell Her Majesty now.

314
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,530
I'm ill. I'm in great pain.

315
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,090
I'm afraid I can't visit the palace for now.

316
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,210
Are you faking it?

317
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,700
Was it so obvious?

318
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,770
If you informed Her Majesty,

319
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,650
she would send an imperial physician here.

320
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,740
Would you be able to fool the physician
Her Majesty sent?

321
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,970
This is treachery against the empress.
Are you sure about this?

322
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,850
No way!

323
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,650
No.

324
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,250
I should go into hiding for a couple of days.

325
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,130
Jing Xin, I leave everyone here in your care.

326
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,860
Keep them safe for me.

327
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,340
I must start

328
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,730
packing my belongings now.

329
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,860
Tan! Wait.

330
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,410
Jing Xin, give us some privacy.

331
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,250
I need to have a word with the second princess.

332
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,890
Do you really think you can run away?

333
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,820
What else can I do now?

334
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,220
Everyone here knows that

335
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,220
Qu Tan Er is a knowledgeable person.

336
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,300
I can usually get away by acting smart.

337
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,060
But in a real test...

338
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,340
There is no way I could fool anyone!

339
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,300
I must leave now.

340
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,770
So you know your own flaw.

341
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,700
Am I doing this for myself?

342
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,460
If they saw through my identity,

343
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,820
you would be in deep trouble again.

344
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,460
But since you choose to come here now,

345
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,340
are you going to elope with me?

346
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,610
If you want to elope, you should
elope with someone else.

347
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,180
But if you want to fool everyone,

348
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,940
come with me to the study.

349
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,700
The study?

350
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,370
Can't we elope to somewhere else?

351
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,220
This is Qu Tan Er's handwriting.

352
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,770
How do you know?

353
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,340
I read her letters.

354
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,890
Plenty of them.

355
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,580
She wrote them to a worthless friend.

356
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,530
So I know her handwriting very well.

357
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,250
These are

358
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,770
indeed letters and poems written

359
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,180
by Qu Tan Er.

360
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,770
What I need from you

361
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,010
is to copy her handwriting

362
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,580
as much as you can before the test.

363
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,650
In case Her Majesty wants to conduct any written tests.

364
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,250
But there are so many words.

365
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,060
How can I possibly do it in three days?

366
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,820
I bet I couldn't copy even a word.

367
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,340
One word is all you need.

368
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,010
The word "Yong" is all you need to mimic.
[*"Yong" means "forever"]

369
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,650
That's all?

370
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,610
Whatever Her Majesty wants,

371
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,220
I must only write the word "Yong"?

372
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,250
Are you serious about this?

373
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,770
The word

374
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,730
contains all the common strokes
we need for calligraphy.

375
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,010
When we learn how to write,

376
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,700
we start by practicing with this word.

377
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,580
If you master this word,

378
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,770
you can basically write any word.

379
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,940
If there is any suspicion,

380
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,010
you can always say it's your hasty handwriting.

381
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,770
This is still very tedious,

382
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,370
but it's much simpler than I thought.

383
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,580
Fine. I can do it.

384
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,010
Go for it.

385
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,060
As long as I have you with me,

386
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,940
I can master it in no time.

387
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,580
This is the power of love.

388
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,010
You should start practicing now.

389
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
Every four hours,

390
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,370
I'll have Jing Xin

391
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,460
send your handwriting to my study.

392
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,890
I'll send them back after marking.

393
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,890
Why?

394
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,340
If you stay with me,

395
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,980
you can supervise me at all times.

396
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,940
I must keep this a secret from my eldest brother.

397
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,410
If he found out

398
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,100
you're not the real Qu Tan Er,

399
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,490
your life would be in danger.

400
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,820
So you must practice in seclusion.

401
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,770
Other than Jing Xin,

402
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,530
no one is allowed to visit you.

403
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,100
At least show me how to write one word.

404
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,440
(Yong)

405
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,060
Amazing.

406
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,370
It's the same as her handwriting.

407
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,100
I'll give it a try.

408
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,160
(Yong)

409
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,760
(Yong)

410
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,730
Here.

411
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,080

♪From a full moon to a new moon,

413
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,460
Press downward, but don't overdo it.

414
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,770
A stroke across like a short leash.

415
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,180
A vertical stroke with an elegant curve.

416
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,180
A stroke across like a short leash.

417
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,770
Slow down. I didn't catch that.

418
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:55,650
♪I will never stop waiting for your return♪

419
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,980
♪We'll wander the land together,

420
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,500
♪In your journey, I'll never be lonely♪

421
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,820
That's all for the lesson.

422
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,980
You should practice on your own.

423
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,250
I don't want to be executed over this.

424
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,220
♪Zhuangzi said love was the butterfly's secret♪

425

♪We can say, love, love, love, love♪

435
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,250
(The word has the right form.)

436
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,700
(I can't accompany you tomorrow.)

437
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,010
(I wish you all the best.)

438
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,130
(I love Cheng Cheng, forever and always)
(It's been a long day. Rest well.)

439
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,860
I thought this was a test.

440
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,820
Why am I at the training ground?

441
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,250
Your Highness.

442
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,060
The test is a martial art test,

443
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
not a written test.

444
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,490
That means my practice for the past few days

445
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,700
was a waste of time.

446
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,010
I don't know martial arts.

447
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,340
How can I take the test?

448
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,060
I don't have an answer for that.

449
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,890
Your Highness.

450
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,730
Message from Her Majesty.

451
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,700
As a princess of our country,

452
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,060
it's your duty to devote your life
to the benefit of Dongyue.

453
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,980
The test today

454
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,340
is to determine whether Your Highness
has a strong physique

455
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,700
and whether you can shoulder
great responsibilities.

456
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,940
(It's just a physical test.)

457
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,940
(As a former real estate agent
who ran around the city,)

458
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,220
(my stamina must be above average.)

459
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,300
I understand.

460
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,460
I will do my best.

461
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,220
These are bows with draw weights

462
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,580
of one dan, three dan, and nine dan.
[*One dan equals 120 catties]

463
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,820
You may start with the lowest draw weight.

464
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,490
We'll see how much draw weight is your limit.

465
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,700
This is a test of your arm strength.

466
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,610
This should be a walk in the park.

467
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,060
Cheng Cheng taught me this.

468
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,060
I can draw a bow all right.

469
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,340
Hitting the bullseye

470
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,180
won't even be a problem.

471
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,060
(No.)

472
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,010
(Tan Er was frail.)

473
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,220
(Her Majesty knows that.)

474
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,890
(These tasks are easy for me.)

475
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,340
(But if I do it too well,)

476
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,060
(it draws nothing but suspicion.)

477
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,580
Official.

478
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,940
Even the lowest draw weight is too much for me.

479
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,530
I can't even pull the string.

480
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,650
Next.

481
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,130
Your Highness.

482
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,060
Please.

483
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,060
I can't handle it.

484
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,010
That hurts a lot.

485
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,220
That's all for today.

486
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,220
The joy of a newlywed hasn't worn off,

487
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,220
so I lack the necessary practice.

488
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,980
I'm sorry for being such a letdown.

489
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,610
Message from Her Majesty.

490
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,060
Your Highness must come to the palace
to practice every day.

491
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,820
Your next attempt will be in ten days.

492
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,370
Why can't Her Majesty give up on me?

493
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,180
I have to go to the palace every day?

494
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,460
I didn't catch that.

495
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,250
I mean I'll not disappoint Her Majesty again.

496
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,840
(Princess's Residence)

497
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,730
Tan.

498
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,370
How did the test go

499
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,340
with your handwriting?

500
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,300
Forget about it.

501
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,890
Jing Xin, you may leave now.

502
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,100
How did it go?

503
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,890
There was no written test.

504
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,890
But there was a physical test.

505
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,060
I messed up.

506
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,530
I saw how you went over the wall.

507
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,580
Your strength is on par with the other women,

508
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,130
perhaps it's even better.

509
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
You did this on purpose.

510
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,530
You saw me went over the wall

511
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,010
so you think I'm strong.

512
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,300
Do you want to find out

513
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,300
what I'm really capable of?

514
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,860
That won't be necessary.

515
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,370
Please enlighten me.

516
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,650
Why did you act like a weakling?

517
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,650
Since you know me so well,

518
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,250
why not have a guess?

519
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,650
That was because you knew

520
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,180
you were much muscular than the real Qu Tan Er.

521
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,220
To avoid suspicion,

522
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,300
you would rather fail the test

523
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,410
by pretending to be frail.

524
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,770
Muscular?

525
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,890
I'm muscular?

526
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,700
If that's how you see me,

527
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,530
I'll stop liking you!

528
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,180
Aren't you afraid of losing my favor?

529
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,820
But the way you improvised

530
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,770
was impressive.

531
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,650
I had underestimated you.

532
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,980
There are more you haven't seen!

533
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,220
We have the time.

534
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,100
You will discover my strength over time.

535
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,010
No.

536
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,370
What?

537
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,010
What was the purpose of this test?

538
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,890
They said I needed a strong body
to take on great responsibilities.

539
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,300
That's about it.

540
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,580
What responsibilities...

541
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,940
would require you to have a strong physique?

542
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,700
The test could have been...

543
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,580
about national affairs or military tactics.

544
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,580
Those are more reasonable.

545
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,450
But they went out of their way

546
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,530
only to find out whether you're strong enough.

547
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,770
Isn't that strange to you?

548
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,930
What do you think the purpose is?

549
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,380
I have no clue now.

550
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,250
But this is worrying.

551
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,770
You care a lot about me.

552
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,140
You took it wrongly.

553
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,770
I'm not the other guy.

554
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,060
You clearly care a lot about me.

555
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,170
Your cold shoulder is just a bluff.

556
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,140
My dear Cheng Cheng never let me down.

557
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,250
I can't wait to prove you wrong.

558
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,060
A physical test?

559
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,060
Qu Tan Er has always been frail.

560
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,340
Her Majesty knows that.

561
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,580
But a physical test...

562
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,730
Was it meant to embarrass her?

563
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,340
Is Her Majesty upset?

564
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,420
Was the princess punished?

565
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,100
You can consider it a punishment.

566
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,010
But it's weird.

567
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,340
It's weird? How so?

568
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,490
Her Majesty ordered the second princess to
practice every day at the palace.

569
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,970
Practice?

570
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,100
Her Majesty ordered only her to go to
the palace and practice.

571
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,530
It's as if

572
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,490
she is being trained to become
the next crown princess.

573
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,770
Your Highness, don't worry.

574
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,420
That might not be Her Majesty's plan.

575
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,660
Perhaps this was a warning for her.

576
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,490
Even if that wasn't the intention,

577
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,970
when the officers share this speculation,

578
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,730
those who are still wavering

579
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,340
would side with Qu Tan Er.

580
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,170
Then it's time to take action, Your Highness.

581
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,210
Your Majesty, please don't be upset.

582
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,450
The second princess lacks training.

583
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,970
She wasn't born with any defect.

584
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,690
That is true,

585
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,420
but she is too weak.

586
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,420
Her frail body

587
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,580
is not fit to serve me.

588
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,010
Now is the opportunity

589
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,340
to have her in the palace.

590
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,690
We'll slowly nourish her without her noticing,

591
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,930
so she can take over your duties.

592
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
I don't want to

593
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,380
place my hope on others either.

594
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,450
The altar requires great power.

595
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,860
Destiny waits for no one.

596
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,100
We have many farmlands.

597
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,930
An adequate increment in taxation

598
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,770
will resolve the funding problems.

599
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,170
I will see to it myself. Your Majesty
shouldn't be worried.

600
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,450
I have faith in you.

601
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,770
But my health has been deteriorating.

602
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,340
I hope Tan Er doesn't fall short.

603
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,900
When I need her to succeed the throne,

604
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,860
she must prove her worth to the imperial officers.
