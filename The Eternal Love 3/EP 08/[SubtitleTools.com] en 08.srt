The medicine is not working at all?

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,140
Why didn't I think of him?

18
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,810
Since we're already here,

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,500
he might be here too.

20
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,330
Jing Xin, go out of town with me tomorrow.
I need to find someone.

21
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,220
To find someone?

22
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,810
If it's a physician you need,

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,060
you don't need to go in person.

24
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,250
I can get it done for you.

25
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,250
No.

26
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,330
The person I need...

27
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,970
is not someone

28
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,970
you can easily hire.

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,370
Who is it?

30
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,020
You'll find out tomorrow.

31
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,890
Am I at the wrong place

32
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,610
or does this place get renovated?

33
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,300
This place is far from the city.

34
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,140
When did you come here before?

35
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,250
Let's go.

36
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,450
Black hair.

37
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,060
Is this really Liu Qian Shui?
[*Literally means "streaming thousand water"]

38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,880
(Hermit Liu)

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,730
Senior.

40
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,970
Excuse me...

41
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,140
Liu Qian Shui!

42
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,170
Please spare me, hero!

43
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,810
Could you give me a few more days?

44
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,700
Are you here for fortune-telling

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,170
or exorcism?

46
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,060
Insolence!

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,810
She's the second princess of Dongyue!

48
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,780
Are you not going to greet her!

49
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,730
She's the second princess?

50
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,220
Then I'm the second prince!

51
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,580
Please, no!

52
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,180
I wasn't expecting Her Highness's arrival.

53
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,580
I apologize for my manner.

54
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,700
All right, Jing Xin.

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,530
There is no need for violence.

56
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,210
Wait for me outside.

57
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,020
Fine.

58
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,460
What the...

59
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,210
You're like a coward.

60
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,420
You came here too?

61
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,580
I've always been here.

62
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,930
You've grown younger.

63
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,340
Is this sorcery or did you dye your hair?

64
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,420
I wasn't old anyway.

65
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,740
True.

66
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,460
You're no ordinary man.

67
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,650
You're a sage from Xuanling Continent.

68
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,490
It's been so long.

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Some adjustments seem normal.

70
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,210
(So people are already spreading rumors
about my incredible power.)

71
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,970
As your leader,

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,340
the chief of the Qu Clan of Xuanling Continent

73
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,620
has a new mission for you.

74
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,090
Chief?

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,420
I made some analysis.

76
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,770
It was caused by an anomaly
of the Soul-guarding Bead.

77
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,140
Am I still the host of Soul-guarding Beads?

78
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,580
(What is a Soul-guarding Pork?)
[*"Pork" sounds like "Bead" in Chinese]

79
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,050
(I've never tried that before.)

80
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,420
(How can she be a host of some pig?)

81
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,900
(Maybe she is just crazy.)

82
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,620
(I can put this fool to great use.)

83
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,340
Stop pretending.

84
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,650
There is no outsider around.

85
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,810
Soul-guarding Bead.

86
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,620
The Xuanling Continent?

87
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,370
See? You do know the countersign.

88
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,370
Comrade Liu Qian Shui.

89
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,340
We finally meet again.

90
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,930
(Liu Qian Shui?)

91
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,460
But I'm Liu Bai Shui. Now with nine hundred more?
[Literally means "streaming hundred water"]

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,340
(Forget it. I won't be disadvantaged anyway.)

93
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,740
The way you put it

94
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,210
cleared all the doubt for me.

95
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,490
Fine, enough with the fancy words.

96
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,210
Comrade Liu.

97
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,810
It's time to ditch your disguise.

98
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,810
I really need your help this time.

99
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,300
You need my help?

100
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
You could have started with that.

101
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,930
I, Liu Bai Shui, may not be a prodigy,

102
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,580
but I am

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,620
fairly knowledgeable in the field
of fortune-telling.

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,210
- I have the wisdom of Heaven and Earth...
- All right.

105
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,530
Yin Yang and...

106
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,900
I know you dyed your hair.

107
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,620
But where did you get your accent?

108
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,250
Liu Bai Shui?

109
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,900
You're nine hundred short.

110
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,300
Forget it.

111
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,050
You can have whatever name you like.

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,770
However, about the thing,

113
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,740
I need to tell you from the beginning.

114
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,320
(Hermit Liu can answer all your doubts.)

115
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,140
Do you understand

116
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,580
what I just told you?

117
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,460
(A parallel universe?)

118
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,620
(She is so hopeless.)

119
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,620
(It would be a pity not to make
a fortune out of her.)

120
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,650
Judging by what Your Highness said,

121
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,090
the secondary prince consort
certainly has amnesia.

122
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,050
But this could be problematic.

123
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,340
You can't do nothing either?

124
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,770
Then do you have the Soul-guarding Bead

125
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,770
and the Soul-parting Flute?

126
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,050
I could give it a try myself.

127
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,490
I don't have them with me.

128
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,210
Can't you be more useful?

129
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,140
You don't have an idea or a magic item.

130
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,210
Or course, I have an idea.

131
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,460
There is a cure for it.

132
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,090
But the ingredients are very expensive

133
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,250
and it's hard to find.

134
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,340
It might require a hefty sum of money.

135
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,250
So you need money.

136
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,770
That's easy.

137
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,530
Look.

138
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,970
I must first travel to Beixuan

139
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,370
to acquire a herb.

140
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,490
That journey alone

141
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,250
could be very costly.

142
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,810
A hundred taels should be enough, right?

143
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,810
Yes.

144
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,370
That's enough for the first ingredient.

145
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,460
As for the second ingredient,

146
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,090
I must go to Nanlu to procure it.

147
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,250
That trip could cost me

148
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,300
quite a fortune.

149
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
Fine. Here you are.

150
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,650
All right.

151
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,580
As for the third ingredient,

152
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,650
which is also the most crucial of all,

153
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,580
I must travel

154
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,810
to Xiyue instead.

155
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,050
Trust me.

156
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,370
I will require

157
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,730
several Ferghana horses on my journey

158
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,780
to find the third herb before the next spring.

159
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,700
The next spring?

160
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,700
That won't do.

161
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,810
How much do you need?

162
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,930
Just get to the point.

163
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,460
Sure.

164
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,610
I'll give you a straight answer.

165
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,050
Look.

166
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,140
The truth is...

167
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,340
After we've combined the several main herbs

168
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,610
of this prescription,

169
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,050
the rest of the ingredients

170
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,250
are easy to find.

171
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,050
The other

172
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,610
ingredients are things, such as

173
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,900
millennial ginseng,

174
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,930
knotweed,

175
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
and old Ganoderma fungi

176
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,540
that grows on cliffs.

177
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,340
Right!

178
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,250
The most important ingredient of all

179
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,540
might require me to go to...

180
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,250
Xuan...

181
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,930
Wait.

182
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,700
The Xuanling Continent.

183
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,730
After I get there, we'll have all the ingredients

184
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,340
to make the medicine.

185
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,700
Fine.

186
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,020
You can keep all the money.

187
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,100
Feel free to let me know if you need more.

188
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,540
I think it's enough for now.

189
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,930
Judging by Your Highness's heartfelt story,

190
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,780
it seems like.

191
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,250
Your Highness's love for the secondary
prince consort is true.

192
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,780
I'm sure you will find happiness together.

193
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,540
So don't worry.

194
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,580
You paid me well.

195
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,490
I will do whatever within my capability
to realize your goal.

196
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,780
I don't need your flattery.

197
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,660
But I need to know.

198
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,410
How long is it going to take
to collect all the herbs?

199
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,460
I think it's around...

200
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,930
July and August,

201
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,700
ten days to run and hide...

202
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,170
It should take a month or so.

203
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
That's too long!

204
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,370
I need it done as soon as possible.

205
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,930
Do you have another way?

206
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,900
More haste, less speed.

207
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,490
I will need more time to brew the medicine.

208
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,050
Trust me.

209
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,900
These herbs have unique features and they

210
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,050
conflict with each other.

211
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,100
The slightest error in the brewing

212
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,490
will cause devastating consequences.

213
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,780
So you must be patient.

214
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,930
Fine.

215
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,370
But get it done as soon as you can.

216
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,020
Sure.

217
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,850
One more thing.

218
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:42,980
Use the

219
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,370
finest herbs for this medicine you'll be making.

220
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,050
Money is not an issue here.

221
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,780
I assure you.

222
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,930
I will spend

223
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,170
every penny you paid me.

224
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,250
Very well. That settles it for now.

225
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,930
I'm counting on you.

226
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:56,780
Don't mention it.

227
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,410
I should get going.

228
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,490
Jing Xin, let's go.

229
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,250
Your Highness,

230
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,290
have a nice day!

231
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,810
So she is the future crown princess of Dongyue.

232
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,660
The country is doomed.

233
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,540
Forget it.

234
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,780
Even with all this money,

235
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,810
her sickness is hopeless.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,360
(Princess's Residence)

237
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
What is going on?

238
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,700
Your Highness, it's Official Su.

239
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,850
Let's check it out.

240
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,700
I've been expecting you, Your Highness.

241
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,170
Second Princess Qu Tan Er, heed this decree.

242
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,020
As written in this imperial order,

243
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,140
Her Majesty has great expectations
for Second Princess Qu Tan Er.

244
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,250
Thus, the princess's capability shall be tested,

245
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,370
so she can be take up the right position

246
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,540
to serve Her Majesty and the country
as soon as possible.

247
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,140
The end.

248
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,610
I accept the imperial order.

249
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,250
Your Highness has three days.

250
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,050
Her Majesty

251
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,980
has given Your Highness time
for proper preparation.

252
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,580
I hope Your Highness lives up to the expectation.

253
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,610
I should take my leave now.

254
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,810
Jing Xin.

255
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,460
You're a knowledgeable person

256
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,900
and have mastered many art forms.

257
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,930
This is a great

258
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,140
opportunity for you to prove your worth.

259
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,410
Eldest Brother, you're right.

260
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,100
I wish you all the best, Your Highness.

261
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,370
Am I really that amazing to you?

262
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,900
I hope you're right about me.

263
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,170
I need some time to process this.

264
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,700
A fine cup of tea.

265
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,900
Official Su has contributed much to the country.

266
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,850
It's a token of goodwill.

267
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,700
I hope you like it.

268
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,220
I will gladly accept Your Highness's kindness.

269
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,140
You were at the second princess's residence
to send the imperial order.

270
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,170
Was everyone at the scene?

271
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,730
Mo Yan Chen is doing well.

272
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,170
Your Highness has nothing to worry about.

273
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,050
How can he be well?

274
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,250
He gave his heart to Qu Tan Er.

275
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,370
Yet she never answered his love.

276
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,050
As soon as Your Highness rises to power,

277
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,780
Prince Yan Chen will certainly...

278
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,340
Mi Xue.

279
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,900
I want to be more than just his aide.

280
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,100
Your Highness is loyal,

281
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,020
not to mention ambitious.

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,780
But there is one thing I don't understand.

283
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
I hope Your Highness doesn't find it offensive.

284
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,490
Official Su, you're one of us.

285
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,660
Do tell.

286
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,290
You went out of your way to make this test happen.

287
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,410
If Qu Tan Er actually passed the test,

288
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,900
wouldn't your effort end up helping the enemy?

289
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,540
I had taken that into account.

290
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,540
Whether Qu Tan Er passes the test or not,

291
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,410
it won't end well for her.

292
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,370
I don't understand.

293
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,370
If she passed the test,

294
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Her Majesty would be warier of her.

295
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,900
But if she failed,

296
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,930
it would be evident to Her Majesty

297
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,490
that she is not worthy of being the crown princess.

298
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,780
Your Highness is very tactful indeed.

299
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,660
Impressive.

300
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,900
In that case,

301
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,610
I must send the message to Her Majesty.

302
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,410
I've taken enough of your time.

303
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,460
Mi Xue, see Official Su off.

304
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,610
This way, please.

305
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,660
This is bad.

306
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,340
Why are they going to test me all of a sudden?

307
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,370
What should I do?

308
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,660
I should malinger.

309
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,050
Yes, I should malinger.

310
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,100
Tan.

311
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,250
Tan? What's wrong?

312
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,660
Jing Xin!

313
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,930
Jing Xin, tell Her Majesty now.

314
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,930
I'm ill. I'm in great pain.

315
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,490
I'm afraid I can't visit the palace for now.

316
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,610
Are you faking it?

317
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,100
Was it so obvious?

318
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,170
If you informed Her Majesty,

319
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,050
she would send an imperial physician here.

320
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,140
Would you be able to fool the physician
Her Majesty sent?

321
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,370
This is treachery against the empress.
Are you sure about this?

322
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,250
No way!

323
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,050
No.

324
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,650
I should go into hiding for a couple of days.

325
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,530
Jing Xin, I leave everyone here in your care.

326
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,260
Keep them safe for me.

327
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,740
I must start

328
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,130
packing my belongings now.

329
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,260
Tan! Wait.

330
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,810
Jing Xin, give us some privacy.

331
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,650
I need to have a word with the second princess.

332
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,290
Do you really think you can run away?

333
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,220
What else can I do now?

334
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,620
Everyone here knows that

335
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,620
Qu Tan Er is a knowledgeable person.

336
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,700
I can usually get away by acting smart.

337
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,460
But in a real test...

338
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,740
There is no way I could fool anyone!

339
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,700
I must leave now.

340
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,170
So you know your own flaw.

341
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,100
Am I doing this for myself?

342
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,860
If they saw through my identity,

343
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,220
you would be in deep trouble again.

344
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,860
But since you choose to come here now,

345
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,740
are you going to elope with me?

346
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,010
If you want to elope, you should
elope with someone else.

347
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,580
But if you want to fool everyone,

348
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,340
come with me to the study.

349
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,100
The study?

350
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,770
Can't we elope to somewhere else?

351
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,620
This is Qu Tan Er's handwriting.

352
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,170
How do you know?

353
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,740
I read her letters.

354
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,290
Plenty of them.

355
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,980
She wrote them to a worthless friend.

356
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,930
So I know her handwriting very well.

357
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,650
These are

358
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,170
indeed letters and poems written

359
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,580
by Qu Tan Er.

360
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,170
What I need from you

361
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,410
is to copy her handwriting

362
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,980
as much as you can before the test.

363
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,050
In case Her Majesty wants to conduct any written tests.

364
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,650
But there are so many words.

365
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,460
How can I possibly do it in three days?

366
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,220
I bet I couldn't copy even a word.

367
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,740
One word is all you need.

368
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,410
The word "Yong" is all you need to mimic.
[*"Yong" means "forever"]

369
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,050
That's all?

370
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,010
Whatever Her Majesty wants,

371
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,620
I must only write the word "Yong"?

372
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,650
Are you serious about this?

373
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,170
The word

374
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,130
contains all the common strokes
we need for calligraphy.

375
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,410
When we learn how to write,

376
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,100
we start by practicing with this word.

377
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,980
If you master this word,

378
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,170
you can basically write any word.

379
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,340
If there is any suspicion,

380
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,410
you can always say it's your hasty handwriting.

381
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,170
This is still very tedious,

382
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,770
but it's much simpler than I thought.

383
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,980
Fine. I can do it.

384
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,410
Go for it.

385
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,460
As long as I have you with me,

386
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,340
I can master it in no time.

387
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,980
This is the power of love.

388
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,410
You should start practicing now.

389
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Every four hours,

390
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:52,770
I'll have Jing Xin

391
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,860
send your handwriting to my study.

392
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,290
I'll send them back after marking.

393
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,290
Why?

394
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,740
If you stay with me,

395
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,380
you can supervise me at all times.

396
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,340
I must keep this a secret from my eldest brother.

397
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,810
If he found out

398
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,500
you're not the real Qu Tan Er,

399
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,890
your life would be in danger.

400
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,220
So you must practice in seclusion.

401
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,170
Other than Jing Xin,

402
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,930
no one is allowed to visit you.

403
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,500
At least show me how to write one word.

404
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,840
(Yong)

405
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,460
Amazing.

406
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,770
It's the same as her handwriting.

407
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,500
I'll give it a try.

408
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,560
(Yong)

409
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,160
(Yong)

410
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,130
Here.

411
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,480

♪From a full moon to a new moon,

413
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,860
Press downward, but don't overdo it.

414
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,170
A stroke across like a short leash.

415
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,580
A vertical stroke with an elegant curve.

416
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,580
A stroke across like a short leash.

417
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,170
Slow down. I didn't catch that.

418
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:55,050
♪I will never stop waiting for your return♪

419
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,380
♪We'll wander the land together,

420
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,900
♪In your journey, I'll never be lonely♪

421
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,220
That's all for the lesson.

422
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,380
You should practice on your own.

423
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,650
I don't want to be executed over this.

424
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,620
♪Zhuangzi said love was the butterfly's secret♪

425

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,400

♪We can say, love, love, love, love♪

435
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,650
(The word has the right form.)

436
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,100
(I can't accompany you tomorrow.)

437
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,410
(I wish you all the best.)

438
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,530
(I love Cheng Cheng, forever and always)
(It's been a long day. Rest well.)

439
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,260
I thought this was a test.

440
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,220
Why am I at the training ground?

441
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,650
Your Highness.

442
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,460
The test is a martial art test,

443
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
not a written test.

444
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,890
That means my practice for the past few days

445
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,100
was a waste of time.

446
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,410
I don't know martial arts.

447
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,740
How can I take the test?

448
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,460
I don't have an answer for that.

449
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,290
Your Highness.

450
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,130
Message from Her Majesty.

451
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,100
As a princess of our country,

452
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,460
it's your duty to devote your life
to the benefit of Dongyue.

453
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,380
The test today

454
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,740
is to determine whether Your Highness
has a strong physique

455
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,100
and whether you can shoulder
great responsibilities.

456
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,340
(It's just a physical test.)

457
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,340
(As a former real estate agent
who ran around the city,)

458
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,620
(my stamina must be above average.)

459
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,700
I understand.

460
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,860
I will do my best.

461
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,620
These are bows with draw weights

462
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,980
of one dan, three dan, and nine dan.
[*One dan equals 120 catties]

463
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,220
You may start with the lowest draw weight.

464
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,890
We'll see how much draw weight is your limit.

465
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,100
This is a test of your arm strength.

466
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,010
This should be a walk in the park.

467
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,460
Cheng Cheng taught me this.

468
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,460
I can draw a bow all right.

469
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,740
Hitting the bullseye

470
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,580
won't even be a problem.

471
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,460
(No.)

472
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,410
(Tan Er was frail.)

473
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,620
(Her Majesty knows that.)

474
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,290
(These tasks are easy for me.)

475
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,740
(But if I do it too well,)

476
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,460
(it draws nothing but suspicion.)

477
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,980
Official.

478
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,340
Even the lowest draw weight is too much for me.

479
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,930
I can't even pull the string.

480
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,050
Next.

481
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,530
Your Highness.

482
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,460
Please.

483
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,460
I can't handle it.

484
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,410
That hurts a lot.

485
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,620
That's all for today.

486
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,620
The joy of a newlywed hasn't worn off,

487
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,620
so I lack the necessary practice.

488
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,380
I'm sorry for being such a letdown.

489
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,010
Message from Her Majesty.

490
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,460
Your Highness must come to the palace
to practice every day.

491
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,220
Your next attempt will be in ten days.

492
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,770
Why can't Her Majesty give up on me?

493
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,580
I have to go to the palace every day?

494
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,860
I didn't catch that.

495
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,650
I mean I'll not disappoint Her Majesty again.

496
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,240
(Princess's Residence)

497
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,130
Tan.

498
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,770
How did the test go

499
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,740
with your handwriting?

500
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,700
Forget about it.

501
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,290
Jing Xin, you may leave now.

502
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,500
How did it go?

503
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,290
There was no written test.

504
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,290
But there was a physical test.

505
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,460
I messed up.

506
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,930
I saw how you went over the wall.

507
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,980
Your strength is on par with the other women,

508
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,530
perhaps it's even better.

509
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
You did this on purpose.

510
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,930
You saw me went over the wall

511
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,410
so you think I'm strong.

512
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,700
Do you want to find out

513
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,700
what I'm really capable of?

514
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,260
That won't be necessary.

515
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,770
Please enlighten me.

516
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,050
Why did you act like a weakling?

517
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,050
Since you know me so well,

518
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,650
why not have a guess?

519
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,050
That was because you knew

520
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,580
you were much muscular than the real Qu Tan Er.

521
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,620
To avoid suspicion,

522
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,700
you would rather fail the test

523
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,810
by pretending to be frail.

524
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,170
Muscular?

525
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,290
I'm muscular?

526
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,100
If that's how you see me,

527
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,930
I'll stop liking you!

528
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,580
Aren't you afraid of losing my favor?

529
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,220
But the way you improvised

530
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,170
was impressive.

531
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,050
I had underestimated you.

532
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,380
There are more you haven't seen!

533
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,620
We have the time.

534
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,500
You will discover my strength over time.

535
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,410
No.

536
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,770
What?

537
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,410
What was the purpose of this test?

538
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,290
They said I needed a strong body
to take on great responsibilities.

539
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,700
That's about it.

540
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
What responsibilities...

541
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,340
would require you to have a strong physique?

542
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,100
The test could have been...

543
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,980
about national affairs or military tactics.

544
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Those are more reasonable.

545
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,850
But they went out of their way

546
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,930
only to find out whether you're strong enough.

547
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,170
Isn't that strange to you?

548
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,330
What do you think the purpose is?

549
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,780
I have no clue now.

550
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,650
But this is worrying.

551
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,170
You care a lot about me.

552
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,540
You took it wrongly.

553
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,170
I'm not the other guy.

554
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,460
You clearly care a lot about me.

555
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,570
Your cold shoulder is just a bluff.

556
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,540
My dear Cheng Cheng never let me down.

557
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,650
I can't wait to prove you wrong.

558
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,460
A physical test?

559
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,460
Qu Tan Er has always been frail.

560
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,740
Her Majesty knows that.

561
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,980
But a physical test...

562
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,130
Was it meant to embarrass her?

563
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,740
Is Her Majesty upset?

564
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,820
Was the princess punished?

565
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,500
You can consider it a punishment.

566
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,410
But it's weird.

567
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,740
It's weird? How so?

568
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,890
Her Majesty ordered the second princess to
practice every day at the palace.

569
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,370
Practice?

570
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,500
Her Majesty ordered only her to go to
the palace and practice.

571
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:46,930
It's as if

572
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,890
she is being trained to become
the next crown princess.

573
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,170
Your Highness, don't worry.

574
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,820
That might not be Her Majesty's plan.

575
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,060
Perhaps this was a warning for her.

576
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,890
Even if that wasn't the intention,

577
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,370
when the officers share this speculation,

578
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,130
those who are still wavering

579
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,740
would side with Qu Tan Er.

580
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,570
Then it's time to take action, Your Highness.

581
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,610
Your Majesty, please don't be upset.

582
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,850
The second princess lacks training.

583
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,370
She wasn't born with any defect.

584
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,090
That is true,

585
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,820
but she is too weak.

586
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,820
Her frail body

587
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,980
is not fit to serve me.

588
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,410
Now is the opportunity

589
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,740
to have her in the palace.

590
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,090
We'll slowly nourish her without her noticing,

591
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,330
so she can take over your duties.

592
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,300
I don't want to

593
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,780
place my hope on others either.

594
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,850
The altar requires great power.

595
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
Destiny waits for no one.

596
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,500
We have many farmlands.

597
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,330
An adequate increment in taxation

598
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,170
will resolve the funding problems.

599
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,570
I will see to it myself. Your Majesty
shouldn't be worried.

600
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,850
I have faith in you.

601
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,170
But my health has been deteriorating.

602
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,740
I hope Tan Er doesn't fall short.

603
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,300
When I need her to succeed the throne,

604
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,260
she must prove her worth to the imperial officers.
