16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
So it wasn't

17
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,280
Second Princess that asked me here.

18
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,360
It was you.

19
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,959
I want to talk to you.

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
Why won't you even give me one chance?

21
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,399
You have a habit of lying.

22
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,839
I won't listen to your lies.

23
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
I know you like balsam.

24
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,039
So I asked people to bring some for you.

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm asking you to give me a chance

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
to explain the misunderstanding between us.

27
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:32,080
Talk.

28
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,560
The Empty Fort Strategy and
pretending to surrender

29
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,520
were my doing.

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,959
I'll admit my mistakes.

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
But the ambush

32
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,080
was nothing more than a misunderstanding.

33
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,520
What else could it be?

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,959
I was sending something.

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,599
Do you think

36
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,319
I'm as deceivable as Her Highness?

37
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,000
I never wanted to lie to you.

38
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,920
It was a border skirmish

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,839
and you said the ambush was a delivery.

40
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,239
Isn't that ridiculous?

41
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Not to mention...

42
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,239
You're a married man,

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,679
but you're meeting a lady alone

44
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,119
and showing her flowers.

45
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,280
You violated the moral codes for men
and broke the law.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,479
Don't even try to trick me again.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,720
Trying to explain everything to her

48
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,200
is worse than impossible.

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,920
Have some patience.

50
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,640
I'll figure something out.

51
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,039
I have an idea.

52
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
Who allowed you to come in?

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,159
You were forced to have the
peace-making marriage,

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,439
but you already have someone you love.

55
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,680
And that's Feng Yang.

56
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,400
You know everything?

57
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Not only do I know,

58
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:57,599
I can also offer you help.

59
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,719
If you want me to help you,

60
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,960
you must tell me

61
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,279
what happened on your wedding night.

62
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:07,999
Don't you tell him.

63
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,240
Her plan

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,479
won't be as effective as mine.

65
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,200
On the wedding night...

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,360
You...

67
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,879
This is how it went.

68
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,599
Are you crazy?

69
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,279
Are all men from Xiyue so impatient?

70
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,200
Xiao Zhen is here?

71
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,479
Don't come any closer.

72
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,240
Don't worry.

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm not planning to serve you at all.

74
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,080
Official Xiao has gone.

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,319
He's gone?

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,400
He's been here for ages.

77
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,319
Finally gone.

78
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,960
I'll cut to the chase then.

79
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,520
I could tell

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,840
you were in love.

81
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
You wanted to save him

82
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,200
so you agreed to this marriage.

83
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,559
I'm in the same predicament.

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
Are you also in love with someone?

85
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,120
Who is it?

86
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,680
Mo Feng Yang.

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,279
Are you a masochist?

88
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,719
Why would you fall in love with her?

89
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,200
Others know she's unyielding and uninhibited,

90
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,400
but I know how gentle and vulnerable she could be.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,080
If you manage to fix me up with her,

92
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,159
I can help you avenge

93
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:51,840
Mo Lian Cheng's humiliation.

94
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,039
The skirmishes around our borders

95
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,599
will be resolved in no time.

96
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,120
(He seems honest.)

97
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,719
(I don't think he's a spy.)

98
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,479
Who would have thought

99
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,279
you're a man of some tactical shrewdness?

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,719
If you're unwilling to help,

101
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,200
then we can go on our separate ways.

102
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,479
May we make a good team.

103
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,640
We came to an agreement.

104
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,759
That's all there was to it.

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,680
Blabbermouth.

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,240
You ratted me out.

107
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,240
Why should you care what happened
between him and me?

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,439
You can just go and meet Her Majesty.

109
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,640
You...

110
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,840
Come with me.

111
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,279
I have nothing to say to you!

112
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,279
We had a deal.

113
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,439
I told you what happened that night

114
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,599
and now you should help me.

115
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,319
Let go of me! Let go!

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,120
I'll say this again.

117
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,200
I have nothing to say to you.

118
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,960
Did you agree to marry him just to save me?

119
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,879
I regret it now.

120
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
If I had another chance,

121
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,120
I would just give up on you!

122
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,559
Who is blackmailing you?

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Her Majesty? Xiao Zhen?

124
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Why are you asking?

125
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,599
What do you want?

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,039
One last question.

127
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,759
Did Xiao Zhen tell you

128
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,240
I was in the palace the whole night?

129
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,319
It was Fourteenth.

130
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,439
Would Fourteenth ever lie to me?

131
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:34,759
He didn't lie.

132
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,719
Her Majesty set us up.

133
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,960
I can see it now.

134
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,879
There was no guard at the forbidden ground.

135
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
I lost the dagger after I was wounded.

136
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,800
Her Majesty ordered me to keep watch.

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
These were all her plans.

138
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,200
Only by letting you know I was injured,

139
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,640
would you agree to the peace-making marriage.

140
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,359
Only when you found out I slept in the palace,

141
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,799
could she alienate us.

142
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,119
You were only there to keep watch at night?

143
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,280
Yes. I was guarding outside the door.

144
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,319
Unlike you,

145
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,960
I never went to her bed.

146
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,759
Then come with me.

147
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,480
It's broad daylight.

148
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,720
Your Highness is so impatient.

149
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,480
You got hurt.

150
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,559
I want to check your injury.

151
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
My injury

152
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,200
is only at the shoulder.

153
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,520
As long as you're not upset at me,

154
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,919
the injury is no big deal.

155
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,439
I was so mad at you,

156
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,840
but you still didn't regain your memories.

157
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,040
It seems like

158
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
I should take it up a notch.

159
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,559
That proves

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
my trust in you.

161
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,119
On the other hand,

162
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,119
you don't seem to trust me at all.

163
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,559
Then...

164
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,439
Let me make it up to you with a reward.

165
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,600
Although...

166
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm still recovering,

167
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,239
you should check my injury in person.

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't worry.

169
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,759
I'll definitely...

170
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,600
check every inch of you.

171
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
You know...

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,919
when I was trapped in the forbidden ground,

173
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,239
what I worry about the most

174
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,559
wasn't my injury.

175
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:21,960
It was...

176
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,439
what you would think of me.

177
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,280
How could a righteous ruler

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,759
employ such a lowly tactic to alienate us?

179
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,319
Don't you think

180
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,960
something is amiss?

181
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,160
You're right.

182
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,799
The entrance to the forbidden ground

183
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,439
was next to the antique shelves
of Her Majesty's bedroom.

184
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,960
The place was creepy and mysterious.

185
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,960
When I went near that place,

186
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,840
the air became stifling.

187
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,080
Perhaps

188
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
I was sensing the Soul-guarding Bead.

189
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
In that case,

190
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,640
the place you went to

191
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
was the Altar of Souls.

192
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,400
The Altar of Souls?

193
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Yes.

194
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,559
In the Kingdom of Dongyue,

195
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,960
the Altar of Souls is where the royal
family pays respect to the ancestors.

196
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,919
It was also used to forge
the Soul-guarding Bead.

197
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,280
If the Soul-guarding Bead is inside the palace,

198
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:07,200
perhaps...

199
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,359
we will have a way to return to our world.

200
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,319
But if that place is hiding

201
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,040
such unspeakable secrets,

202
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,919
Her Majesty must have her reasons...

203
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,679
to lure me there.

204
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:25,119
Then...

205
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,960
Can I now...

206
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,520
do as I wish with you?

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,520
Come back later.

208
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,759
Leave.

209
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,080
Sorry.

210
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,919
Now that you two reconciled,

211
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,480
he should fulfill his promise.

212
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,119
My problems aren't settled yet.

213
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,119
Do you know why you keep failing?

214
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,799
That's because

215
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,999
Feng Yang thought you were a spy.

216
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,600
That's why

217
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
I keep trying to explain to her.

218
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,759
What's the point of just explaining?

219
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,960
You should hear her side of the story.

220
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Who is it?

221
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,239
Who is it?

222
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,759
Who left this flower here?

223
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,200
You, come over here.

224
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,439
Who left this flower here?

225
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,640
General, it was General Yun Xiu.

226
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,239
I don't want to see the flower again!

227
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Here, give it to me.

228
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,200
The more upset you are,

229
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,359
the more innocent he seems.

230
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,799
He is blatantly provoking me

231
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,520
because he's mocking me for
not having evidence.

232
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,040
It's not hard to find evidence.

233
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,919
Plenty of evidence

234
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,559
comes to us effortlessly.

235
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,520
Effortlessly?

236
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,919
Bait him.

237
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,600
If you want the plan to work,

238
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,600
you must first apologize to him.

239
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,520
Your idea

240
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,480
is worse than hers.

241
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,559
It's been hours,

242
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,840
Feng Yang is nowhere to be seen.

243
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,840
It's only been a while and you've
lost patience already.

244
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,319
No wonder Feng Yang says

245
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,280
a man's mind is full

246
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,359
of love.

247
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,200
Stay calm when she's here.

248
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,439
Otherwise, it'll all be for nothing.

249
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:56,879
Prince Consort.

250
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,040
She is here.

251
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
Hide yourselves.

252
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,759
Indeed a good idea.

253
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,119
General, what brought you here?

254
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,840
I saw the flowers.

255
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,960
I misunderstood you.

256
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,840
So Tan Er told you everything.

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,439
Those balsams

258
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,960
were the work of yours and
Her Highness's effort.

259
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,400
Since you showed goodwill,

260
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,480
it will be disrespectful of me
to keep turning you down.

261
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,359
As the military customs say,

262
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:38,559
I'll ask you out for a drink at dusk.

263
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,919
We'll reconcile over the drink.

264
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,040
That's thoughtful of you, General.

265
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,319
I will

266
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,040
meet you there.

267
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,439
Should I bring some snacks and wine?

268
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:49,040
Don't bother.

269
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
I will prepare everything.

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,640
But this is the first time.

271
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:52,879
I should prepare something.

272
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,119
The first time?

273
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,280
It's the first time we set our differences aside.

274
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,200
I hope it won't be the last.

275
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,919
Then, I'll

276
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,080
see you at dusk.

277
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:21,999
Well?

278
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,919
What do you want to prepare for your first date?

279
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:27,919
Should I

280
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,520
prepare a valuable present

281
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,400
for Feng Yang?

282
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,239
I don't think so.

283
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,239
After failing so many times,

284
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,400
I have no idea

285
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,679
what is the right thing to do.

286
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,239
There is only...

287
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,160
one right method.

288
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,119
Be true to her.

289
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,359
Come on.

290
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,600
We shall drink heartily tonight.

291
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,559
Bottoms up.

292
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,840
Since we're drinking tonight,

293
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,280
you can feel free to say and ask anything.

294
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,439
When you first saw me on the battlefield,

295
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,799
what feelings did you have?

296
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Are you asking what I think of your troops?

297
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,960
I apologize if I offended you after drinking.

298
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,600
The cavalries of Xiyue are feared by many.

299
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,080
You lived up to the name when I saw you.

300
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:41,359
But the size of Dongyue's army is now

301
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,759
three times larger than it used to be.

302
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,080
The steeds alone...

303
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,359
Feng Yang, you mustn't talk about
classified information.

304
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,480
You weren't answering my question anyway.

305
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,879
Prince Consort, mind your manner.

306
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,520
I was out of line. I'll drink as my punishment.

307
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
What was it that you wanted to know?

308
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,559
What kind of man do you like?

309
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,280
What kind of relationship
are you hoping to have?

310
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
Like every other woman,

311
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,559
I like the gentle and subtle men of Dongyue.

312
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,519
As for love...

313
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,519
I'll leave that to the man.

314
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,919
You told me not to prepare anything,

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,799
but I insist that you should try

316
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,000
the fine wine of Xiyue.

317
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
To remember this meaningful night.

318
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:04,639
I appreciate the gesture.

319
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,039
Bottoms up.

320
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Come on.

321
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,319
Bottoms up.

322
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,279
Bottoms up.

323
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,840
General Mo.

324
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,439
You are the bravest woman I've ever met.

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,679
General Mo.

326
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,720
You're back.

327
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Your dark circles...

328
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,360
Are you sleepy?

329
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,799
Not at all.

330
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,399
Get to the point then.

331
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,559
How did it go?

332
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,240
There should

333
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,480
more exciting things than just covering mouths.

334
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,200
Last night,

335
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,039
Yun Xiu went behind General Mo.

336
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,159
And then...

337
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,039
helped her on with her coat.

338
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,240
That's all?

339
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,399
That's all.

340
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,840
That was all he did the whole night?

341
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,200
My hype was pointless.

342
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,200
But for Yun Xiu,

343
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,319
this is a significant breakthrough.

344
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,840
If Feng Yang wasn't so paranoid
of her surroundings,

345
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
I would just peek at them.

346
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,559
Go get some sleep.

347
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,200
He's useless.

348
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,519
Although

349
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,360
it's a huge breakthrough for Yun Xiu,

350
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,639
he is barely making any progress.

351
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,919
Lord of Jealousy,

352
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,319
I have two questions for you.

353
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,399
Lord of Jealousy?

354
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,000
You mistrusted the rumors

355
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,200
and used Yun Xiu to upset me.

356
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,679
Keep quiet and listen to my questions.

357
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,600
What kind of girls do you like?

358
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,159
What kind of life do you yearn for?

359
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,639
Because of my amnesia,

360
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,480
I had doubts about many things at the moment.

361
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,760
I found it hard to agree with Eldest
Brother's view on marriage.

362
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,639
So I wasn't interested in girls.

363
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,120
I never yearned for love.

364
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,559
You get an F for that!

365
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,480
You don't know what I want to hear!

366
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,439
After I met Your Highness, everything changed.

367
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,439
It's too late to appease me.

368
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
One who has never seen the stars...

369
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,960
will find the night cold and lonely.

370
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,639
One who has never known love...

371
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,360
will use human relations as protection.

372
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
You helped me realize

373
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,760
that opening up to others

374
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,120
is the only way to have everything.

375
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,799
The person I love and the love I yearn...

376
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,600
will forever...

377
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,480
be whatever you show me.

378
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,240
Nothing more

379
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,000
and nothing less.

380
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,000
By the way, you mentioned

381
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,679
I was the one wooing you
in the other two timelines.

382
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,799
So...

383
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,240
Was I acting like Yun Xiu?

384
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:45,799
Back then,

385
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,240
I was the center of all spotlights
and admired by all.

386
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,720
You had it so much worse than Yun Xiu.

387
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,840
Are you ever tired of bluffing?

388
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:58,439
Believe it or leave it.

389
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,159
Let's get some sleep together.

390
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,960
Feng Yang.

391
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,679
Eighth Brother.

392
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,799
How was last night?

393
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,439
He didn't ask for military information,

394
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,639
ambush me,

395
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,000
or steal my badge.

396
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Then why did I hear that he was acting strange?

397
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,200
What did you hear?

398
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,240
Someone saw you two

399
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,480
hugging each other.

400
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,080
Who is spreading this nonsense?

401
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,319
I'll break their legs!

402
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,639
If you two weren't hugging,

403
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
then he purposely

404
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,880
placed his hand over your mouth.

405
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,559
He was covering my mouth

406
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,039
so I wouldn't expose any
confidential information.

407
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,200
So he helped you put on a coat

408
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,639
for some reason?

409
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,720
Who is spreading these rumors?

410
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,039
I'll cut off their ears as a warning!

411
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,279
You're so anxious.

412
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:46,480
Are the rumors true?

413
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,120
Does it matter?

414
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
He said the ambush was a delivery.

415
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,319
No matter what he does, he will
never earn my trust again.

416
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
We can do this the nice way or the rough way.

417
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,960
What exactly happened during the ambush?

418
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,439
Would you believe me?

419
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,519
What about you?

420
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,559
Then I should leave.

421
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:17,319
Come back here.

422
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Even I who know nothing about military tactics

423
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,399
know no one would disguise
an ambush with a delivery.

424
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,679
Not to mention you're a general who knows

425
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,080
how to pull off the Empty Fort Strategy
and pretend to surrender.

426
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,439
The Empty Fort Strategy and pretending
to surrender were tactics indeed.

427
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,000
Until that day...

428
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,639
I was relieving a garrison.

429
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,960
I led them across the border in secrecy.

430
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:37,679
Why don't we have a bet?

431
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,720
If you can get General Mo's personal trinket,

432
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,279
each of us will give you 100 taels.

433
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,439
Yes.

434
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,799
Get your money ready.

453
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,399
On that day, I was the only one

454
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,639
who saw her weariness and loneliness.

455
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,319
I was also the first...

456
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
to admire her for the woman she is.

457
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,919
After that day,

458
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
I started to pay more attention to her.

459
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,159
I realized that

460
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,760
we share something in common.

461
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
Her determination on the battlefield

462
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,919
cannot conceal her weakness.

463
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,080
She can understand all of my strategies.

464
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,039
She can even stay one step ahead of me.

465
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,760
We are connected.

466
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,399
She has determination and generosity.

467
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,600
In other words,

468
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,240
she is like...

469
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,120
the other me.

470
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,319
The lemons are hanging on the tree,

471
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,799
under the tree, are you and me.

472
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:04,200
You and I?

473
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,039
Not you and I.

474
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,159
It's he and I.

475
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,000
He and you.

476
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,799
Carry on.

477
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,360
There was high tension at the border.

478
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,559
As part of the defensive forces,

479
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,760
I could do nothing.

480
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,200
When the tension receded,

481
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,360
there was an opportunity for a truce.

482
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,799
I thought

483
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
it was the right time to confess my love for her.

484
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,240
But Feng Yang finds you suspicious.

485
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:28,039
Whatever method you employ,

486
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,720
she will think it comes with a motive.

487
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,039
So I resorted to a desperate plan.

488
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,319
I wanted to give her my truce letter and

489
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,360
the present personally.

490
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,639
But she misunderstood it as an ambush.

491
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,319
So she retaliated.

492
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,000
Xiyue's troops lost.

493
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,480
And after the battle,

494
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,279
I lost my rank...

495
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,159
and was forced to have this peace-making marriage.

496
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:56,399
Your story sounds very miserable.

497
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,319
But it's not Feng Yang's fault for being paranoid.

498
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,519
Did you manage to give her the present?

499
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,200
I was in a rush,

500
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,639
I couldn't give her the present.

501
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,880
But after everything settled,

502
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,279
I tried my best

503
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,000
and found Feng Yang's personal servant.

504
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,200
I asked him to give her

505
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,000
the truce letter and the present
in the name of an admirer.

506
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,279
What was the present you gave her?

507
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,399
Feng Yang's old sword buckle was torn.

508
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,319
I asked around and found out

509
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,000
her favorite flower is balsam.

510
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,679
So I ordered

511
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,919
to have this pair of sword buckle made.

512
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,319
One for her,

513
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,039
the other is for me.

514
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,760
I've seen this sword buckle before.

515
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,399
Where did you see it?

516
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,200
Feng Yang carries it at her waist.

517
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,559
I've seen her wear it many times.

518
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,000
I have an idea.

519
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,080
You can't stay in the room all the time.

520
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,439
You'll become autistic.

521
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,639
You should come out and have a walk more often.

522
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,439
Admire the flowers and enjoy the fresh air.

523
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,919
Doing so can keep the wrinkles away.

524
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,559
I appreciate Your Highness's generosity.

525
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,439
But...

526
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,159
Sunlight! I'll hold the umbrella for you.

527
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,519
The sunlight isn't that bright.

528
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,159
It might rain later.

529
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,720
Let me do it.

530
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,880
Let me do it.

531
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
Let me.

532
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,439
Let me.

533
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,319
How dare you steal from me!

534
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,000
How can you prove this buckle belongs to you?

535
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,279
I carry it with me all the time.

536
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,319
You're clearly...

537
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,240
Where did you get it?

538
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,240
Where did you get yours?

539
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,480
It was a present.

540
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,799
It must be an admirer.

541
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,039
How do you know?

542
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,880
The buckles come in a pair.

543
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,919
They come in a pair?

544
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,120
You mean...

545
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,399
you gave me this buckle?

546
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,120
The container it was kept in

547
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,000
also has a truce letter in it.

548
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,240
Perhaps you never found it.

549
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,480
Where is the container now?

550
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,600
The Mo Residence.

551
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,519
It's simple.

552
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,399
Show everyone the container.

553
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,080
Everything will be clear.

554
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,561
(Truce Letter)

555
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,600
Was this the thing you were delivering?

556
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,880
Why did you hide the truce letter?

557
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,919
The King of Xiyue didn't know my plan.

558
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,399
I hid the letter to avoid further conflicts.

559
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,240
I made the wrong judgment

560
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,439
which led to a misunderstanding.

561
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
Please accept my apologies.

562
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:41,839
This wasn't your fault.

563
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,399
I had wronged you.

564
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I will do my best

565
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,800
to prevent any misunderstanding from you.

566
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,480
But why did you give me a sword buckle?

567
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,079
It was for...

568
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,159
Peace!

569
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,520
It was a token of peace.

570
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,439
I think it's too much for Feng Yang to take in.

571
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,159
We should give her some space.

572
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,720
Yes.

573
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,159
You asked me

574
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,720
to give you an etiquette lesson.

575
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:38,079
We could start today.

576
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,359
This lesson is long overdue.

577
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:40,800
Let's go.

578
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:41,240
Come on.

579
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,119
Let's go.

580
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,679
Feng Yang, we'll leave you
to your contemplating.

581
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,919
This is weird.

582
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,879
The three of them are acting strange.

583
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,960
The misunderstanding has been resolved.

584
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,960
Why wouldn't you let me confess to her?

585
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,520
You're still the Main Prince Consort.

586
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,599
Feng Yang is very law-abiding.

587
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,399
Your reckless confession would
only scare her away.

588
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,000
If you want to win her heart,

589
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,119
you first need her to like you.

590
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,839
Only then will you have a chance.

591
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,000
Indeed.

592
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,280
All she thinks about are
tactics and military affairs.

593
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,040
It won't be easy to get her to like me.

594
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,960
If I remember correctly,

595
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,639
she said she liked gentle and
subtle men of Dongyue.

596
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,040
That's what bothers me the most.

597
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,320
Get rid of the beard,

598
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,040
do some threading,

599
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,040
then get a new hairstyle.

600
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,240
I, Master Tony Tan, will provide
one-stop services for you.

601
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:11,919
I will surely shape you into

602
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,720
a gentle and subtle man of Dongyue.

603
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,760
Not even your mother would recognize you.

604
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:16,720
Nonsense.

605
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,000
Men of Xiyue have their charismatic features.

606
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,919
Do not change yourself all for the sake of a woman.

607
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,119
Childish.

608
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,599
When you wooed me the last two times,

609
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,800
you groomed yourself with thick makeups,

610
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,960
like a peacock.

611
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,679
Otherwise, I wouldn't have fallen for you.

612
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
A peacock?

613
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,599
I would never do such a thing.

614
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,720
Now that we're married,

615
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,439
you're showing your true nature!

616
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,359
I never hide

617
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,839
my true nature.

618
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,599
You don't understand women!

619
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,399
Stop fighting.

620
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm the one wooing Feng Yang, right?

621
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,399
You can decide then.

622
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,480
I'll go with your plan first.

623
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,760
You asked for this.

624
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,280
Don't even think I'll save you later.

625
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,800
You made the right choice.

626
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,159
Don't worry. You can count on me.

627
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,159
Stay still.

628
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,040
Yes, that's it.

629
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:20,879
Put some strength into it.

630
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,560
Push harder.

631
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,480
I am pushing! It's not working!

632
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:26,520
Are you up for the job?

633
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,879
Yun Xiu.

634
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,520
Your curly hair is indeed hard to deal with.

635
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,560
Yu Hao, push harder.

636
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,599
I am pushing.

637
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,560
You're useless.

638
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,480
Leave it to me.

639
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,200
Go ahead.

640
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,240
I'll be gentle.

641
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,200
Hold him still.

642
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,919
Look closely. This is the spot.

643
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,599
It's right here.

644
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:48,760
Now push.

645
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,079
I told you so.

646
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,359
How is this...

647
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:52,720
Push harder.

648
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,839
It won't work.

649
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,560
Push harder.

650
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,280
Yes.

651
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:00,960
All right.

652
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,760
It's done.

653
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:02,800
Okay. Move on to the next.

654
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:03,480
Next.

655
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,079
There's more?

656
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,879
Yes. Come on.

657
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,439
Turn around.

658
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,839
Bear with it.

659
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,359
Must men of Dongyue go through

660
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,240
this torment just to look presentable?

661
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,320
Just bear with it.

662
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,760
Bear with it.

663
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,599
The mighty eagle

664
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,839
has turned into a peacock in a cage.

665
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,079
You got to be the peacock,

666
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,000
so why can't he be one too?

667
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,879
Is pleasing a woman more important
than being himself?

668
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,520
Maybe I'll find out if it's worth it

669
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,960
after Feng Yang sees me.

670
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,040
Didn't I give you a mission?

671
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,159
Why are still you here to spread
fallacies to deceive people?

672
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,919
Get out.

673
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,599
I...

674
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,760
Get out.

675
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,240
I have finished the mission.

676
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,079
Yun Xiu, a man dresses to
court with the lady he likes.

677
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,839
I know what girls like best.

678
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,159
After we've groomed you,

679
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,760
you will experience threading
for the first time.

680
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,560
It's so exciting.

681
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:18,079
Aren't you excited to try it out?

682
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,520
Are you ready?

683
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,240
Let's carry on.

684
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:23,240
