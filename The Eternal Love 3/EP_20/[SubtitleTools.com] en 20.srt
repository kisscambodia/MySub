16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,600
So it wasn't

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,880
Second Princess that asked me here.

18
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,960
It was you.

19
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,559
I want to talk to you.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,479
Why won't you even give me one chance?

21
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,999
You have a habit of lying.

22
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,439
I won't listen to your lies.

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,839
I know you like balsam.

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,639
So I asked people to bring some for you.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm asking you to give me a chance

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
to explain the misunderstanding between us.

27
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,680
Talk.

28
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,160
The Empty Fort Strategy and
pretending to surrender

29
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,120
were my doing.

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,559
I'll admit my mistakes.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
But the ambush

32
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,680
was nothing more than a misunderstanding.

33
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,120
What else could it be?

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,559
I was sending something.

35
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,199
Do you think

36
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,919
I'm as deceivable as Her Highness?

37
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,600
I never wanted to lie to you.

38
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,520
It was a border skirmish

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,439
and you said the ambush was a delivery.

40
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:16,839
Isn't that ridiculous?

41
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,400
Not to mention...

42
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,839
You're a married man,

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,279
but you're meeting a lady alone

44
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,719
and showing her flowers.

45
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,880
You violated the moral codes for men
and broke the law.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,079
Don't even try to trick me again.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Trying to explain everything to her

48
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,800
is worse than impossible.

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
Have some patience.

50
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,240
I'll figure something out.

51
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,639
I have an idea.

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Who allowed you to come in?

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,759
You were forced to have the
peace-making marriage,

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,039
but you already have someone you love.

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
And that's Feng Yang.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,000
You know everything?

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Not only do I know,

58
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,199
I can also offer you help.

59
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,319
If you want me to help you,

60
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,560
you must tell me

61
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,879
what happened on your wedding night.

62
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,599
Don't you tell him.

63
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,840
Her plan

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,079
won't be as effective as mine.

65
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,800
On the wedding night...

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,960
You...

67
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,479
This is how it went.

68
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,199
Are you crazy?

69
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,879
Are all men from Xiyue so impatient?

70
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:58,800
Xiao Zhen is here?

71
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,079
Don't come any closer.

72
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:13,840
Don't worry.

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm not planning to serve you at all.

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,680
Official Xiao has gone.

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,919
He's gone?

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,000
He's been here for ages.

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,919
Finally gone.

78
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,560
I'll cut to the chase then.

79
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,120
I could tell

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,440
you were in love.

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
You wanted to save him

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,800
so you agreed to this marriage.

83
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,159
I'm in the same predicament.

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,560
Are you also in love with someone?

85
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,720
Who is it?

86
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,280
Mo Feng Yang.

87
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,879
Are you a masochist?

88
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,319
Why would you fall in love with her?

89
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
Others know she's unyielding and uninhibited,

90
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,000
but I know how gentle and vulnerable she could be.

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,680
If you manage to fix me up with her,

92
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,759
I can help you avenge

93
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,440
Mo Lian Cheng's humiliation.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,639
The skirmishes around our borders

95
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
will be resolved in no time.

96
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,720
(He seems honest.)

97
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,319
(I don't think he's a spy.)

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,079
Who would have thought

99
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,879
you're a man of some tactical shrewdness?

100
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,319
If you're unwilling to help,

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,800
then we can go on our separate ways.

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,079
May we make a good team.

103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,240
We came to an agreement.

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,359
That's all there was to it.

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,280
Blabbermouth.

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,840
You ratted me out.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
Why should you care what happened
between him and me?

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,039
You can just go and meet Her Majesty.

109
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,240
You...

110
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,440
Come with me.

111
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,879
I have nothing to say to you!

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,879
We had a deal.

113
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,039
I told you what happened that night

114
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,199
and now you should help me.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,919
Let go of me! Let go!

116
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
I'll say this again.

117
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,800
I have nothing to say to you.

118
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,560
Did you agree to marry him just to save me?

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,479
I regret it now.

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,199
If I had another chance,

121
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
I would just give up on you!

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,159
Who is blackmailing you?

123
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Her Majesty? Xiao Zhen?

124
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,720
Why are you asking?

125
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,199
What do you want?

126
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,639
One last question.

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,359
Did Xiao Zhen tell you

128
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,840
I was in the palace the whole night?

129
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,919
It was Fourteenth.

130
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,039
Would Fourteenth ever lie to me?

131
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,359
He didn't lie.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,319
Her Majesty set us up.

133
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,560
I can see it now.

134
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,479
There was no guard at the forbidden ground.

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,120
I lost the dagger after I was wounded.

136
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,400
Her Majesty ordered me to keep watch.

137
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
These were all her plans.

138
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,800
Only by letting you know I was injured,

139
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,240
would you agree to the peace-making marriage.

140
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,959
Only when you found out I slept in the palace,

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,399
could she alienate us.

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,719
You were only there to keep watch at night?

143
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,880
Yes. I was guarding outside the door.

144
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:22,919
Unlike you,

145
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,560
I never went to her bed.

146
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,359
Then come with me.

147
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
It's broad daylight.

148
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,320
Your Highness is so impatient.

149
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,080
You got hurt.

150
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,159
I want to check your injury.

151
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,880
My injury

152
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,800
is only at the shoulder.

153
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,120
As long as you're not upset at me,

154
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,519
the injury is no big deal.

155
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,039
I was so mad at you,

156
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
but you still didn't regain your memories.

157
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,640
It seems like

158
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,120
I should take it up a notch.

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,159
That proves

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
my trust in you.

161
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,719
On the other hand,

162
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,719
you don't seem to trust me at all.

163
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,159
Then...

164
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,039
Let me make it up to you with a reward.

165
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,200
Although...

166
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm still recovering,

167
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,839
you should check my injury in person.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't worry.

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,359
I'll definitely...

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
check every inch of you.

171
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,560
You know...

172
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,519
when I was trapped in the forbidden ground,

173
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,839
what I worry about the most

174
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,159
wasn't my injury.

175
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,560
It was...

176
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,039
what you would think of me.

177
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,880
How could a righteous ruler

178
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,359
employ such a lowly tactic to alienate us?

179
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,919
Don't you think

180
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
something is amiss?

181
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,760
You're right.

182
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,399
The entrance to the forbidden ground

183
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,039
was next to the antique shelves
of Her Majesty's bedroom.

184
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,560
The place was creepy and mysterious.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,560
When I went near that place,

186
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,440
the air became stifling.

187
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,680
Perhaps

188
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
I was sensing the Soul-guarding Bead.

189
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
In that case,

190
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
the place you went to

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
was the Altar of Souls.

192
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,000
The Altar of Souls?

193
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,760
Yes.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,159
In the Kingdom of Dongyue,

195
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,560
the Altar of Souls is where the royal
family pays respect to the ancestors.

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
It was also used to forge
the Soul-guarding Bead.

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,880
If the Soul-guarding Bead is inside the palace,

198
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,800
perhaps...

199
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,959
we will have a way to return to our world.

200
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,919
But if that place is hiding

201
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,640
such unspeakable secrets,

202
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,519
Her Majesty must have her reasons...

203
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,279
to lure me there.

204
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,719
Then...

205
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
Can I now...

206
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,120
do as I wish with you?

207
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,120
Come back later.

208
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,359
Leave.

209
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,680
Sorry.

210
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,519
Now that you two reconciled,

211
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,080
he should fulfill his promise.

212
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,719
My problems aren't settled yet.

213
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,719
Do you know why you keep failing?

214
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,399
That's because

215
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,599
Feng Yang thought you were a spy.

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,200
That's why

217
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,760
I keep trying to explain to her.

218
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,359
What's the point of just explaining?

219
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,560
You should hear her side of the story.

220
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,800
Who is it?

221
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,839
Who is it?

222
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,359
Who left this flower here?

223
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,800
You, come over here.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,039
Who left this flower here?

225
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,240
General, it was General Yun Xiu.

226
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,839
I don't want to see the flower again!

227
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Here, give it to me.

228
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,800
The more upset you are,

229
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:08,959
the more innocent he seems.

230
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,399
He is blatantly provoking me

231
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,120
because he's mocking me for
not having evidence.

232
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,640
It's not hard to find evidence.

233
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,519
Plenty of evidence

234
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,159
comes to us effortlessly.

235
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,120
Effortlessly?

236
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,519
Bait him.

237
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,200
If you want the plan to work,

238
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,200
you must first apologize to him.

239
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,120
Your idea

240
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
is worse than hers.

241
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,159
It's been hours,

242
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
Feng Yang is nowhere to be seen.

243
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,440
It's only been a while and you've
lost patience already.

244
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,919
No wonder Feng Yang says

245
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,880
a man's mind is full

246
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,959
of love.

247
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,800
Stay calm when she's here.

248
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,039
Otherwise, it'll all be for nothing.

249
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,479
Prince Consort.

250
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,640
She is here.

251
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
Hide yourselves.

252
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,359
Indeed a good idea.

253
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,719
General, what brought you here?

254
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
I saw the flowers.

255
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,560
I misunderstood you.

256
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,440
So Tan Er told you everything.

257
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,039
Those balsams

258
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,560
were the work of yours and
Her Highness's effort.

259
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
Since you showed goodwill,

260
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,080
it will be disrespectful of me
to keep turning you down.

261
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
As the military customs say,

262
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,159
I'll ask you out for a drink at dusk.

263
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,519
We'll reconcile over the drink.

264
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,640
That's thoughtful of you, General.

265
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,919
I will

266
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,640
meet you there.

267
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,039
Should I bring some snacks and wine?

268
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,640
Don't bother.

269
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
I will prepare everything.

270
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,240
But this is the first time.

271
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,479
I should prepare something.

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,719
The first time?

273
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,880
It's the first time we set our differences aside.

274
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
I hope it won't be the last.

275
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,519
Then, I'll

276
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,680
see you at dusk.

277
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,599
Well?

278
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,519
What do you want to prepare for your first date?

279
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,519
Should I

280
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,120
prepare a valuable present

281
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,000
for Feng Yang?

282
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,839
I don't think so.

283
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,839
After failing so many times,

284
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,000
I have no idea

285
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,279
what is the right thing to do.

286
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,839
There is only...

287
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,760
one right method.

288
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,719
Be true to her.

289
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,959
Come on.

290
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
We shall drink heartily tonight.

291
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:27,159
Bottoms up.

292
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,440
Since we're drinking tonight,

293
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,880
you can feel free to say and ask anything.

294
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,039
When you first saw me on the battlefield,

295
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,399
what feelings did you have?

296
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Are you asking what I think of your troops?

297
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,560
I apologize if I offended you after drinking.

298
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,200
The cavalries of Xiyue are feared by many.

299
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,680
You lived up to the name when I saw you.

300
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,959
But the size of Dongyue's army is now

301
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,359
three times larger than it used to be.

302
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
The steeds alone...

303
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,959
Feng Yang, you mustn't talk about
classified information.

304
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,080
You weren't answering my question anyway.

305
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,479
Prince Consort, mind your manner.

306
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,120
I was out of line. I'll drink as my punishment.

307
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
What was it that you wanted to know?

308
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,159
What kind of man do you like?

309
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,880
What kind of relationship
are you hoping to have?

310
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,880
Like every other woman,

311
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,159
I like the gentle and subtle men of Dongyue.

312
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,119
As for love...

313
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,119
I'll leave that to the man.

314
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,519
You told me not to prepare anything,

315
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,399
but I insist that you should try

316
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,600
the fine wine of Xiyue.

317
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
To remember this meaningful night.

318
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,239
I appreciate the gesture.

319
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,639
Bottoms up.

320
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,480
Come on.

321
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:52,919
Bottoms up.

322
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:53,879
Bottoms up.

323
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,440
General Mo.

324
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,039
You are the bravest woman I've ever met.

325
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,279
General Mo.

326
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,320
You're back.

327
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Your dark circles...

328
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,960
Are you sleepy?

329
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,399
Not at all.

330
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,999
Get to the point then.

331
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,159
How did it go?

332
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:51,840
There should

333
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,080
more exciting things than just covering mouths.

334
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,800
Last night,

335
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,639
Yun Xiu went behind General Mo.

336
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,759
And then...

337
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,639
helped her on with her coat.

338
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:15,840
That's all?

339
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:16,999
That's all.

340
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
That was all he did the whole night?

341
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,800
My hype was pointless.

342
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,800
But for Yun Xiu,

343
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,919
this is a significant breakthrough.

344
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,440
If Feng Yang wasn't so paranoid
of her surroundings,

345
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,560
I would just peek at them.

346
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,159
Go get some sleep.

347
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,800
He's useless.

348
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,119
Although

349
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,960
it's a huge breakthrough for Yun Xiu,

350
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,239
he is barely making any progress.

351
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,519
Lord of Jealousy,

352
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,919
I have two questions for you.

353
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,999
Lord of Jealousy?

354
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,600
You mistrusted the rumors

355
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,800
and used Yun Xiu to upset me.

356
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,279
Keep quiet and listen to my questions.

357
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,200
What kind of girls do you like?

358
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,759
What kind of life do you yearn for?

359
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,239
Because of my amnesia,

360
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,080
I had doubts about many things at the moment.

361
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,360
I found it hard to agree with Eldest
Brother's view on marriage.

362
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,239
So I wasn't interested in girls.

363
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,720
I never yearned for love.

364
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,159
You get an F for that!

365
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,080
You don't know what I want to hear!

366
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,039
After I met Your Highness, everything changed.

367
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,039
It's too late to appease me.

368
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,360
One who has never seen the stars...

369
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,560
will find the night cold and lonely.

370
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,239
One who has never known love...

371
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,960
will use human relations as protection.

372
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,440
You helped me realize

373
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,360
that opening up to others

374
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,720
is the only way to have everything.

375
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,399
The person I love and the love I yearn...

376
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
will forever...

377
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,080
be whatever you show me.

378
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:23,840
Nothing more

379
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,600
and nothing less.

380
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,600
By the way, you mentioned

381
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,279
I was the one wooing you
in the other two timelines.

382
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,399
So...

383
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,840
Was I acting like Yun Xiu?

384
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,399
Back then,

385
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,840
I was the center of all spotlights
and admired by all.

386
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,320
You had it so much worse than Yun Xiu.

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,440
Are you ever tired of bluffing?

388
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,039
Believe it or leave it.

389
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,759
Let's get some sleep together.

390
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,560
Feng Yang.

391
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,279
Eighth Brother.

392
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,399
How was last night?

393
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,039
He didn't ask for military information,

394
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,239
ambush me,

395
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,600
or steal my badge.

396
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Then why did I hear that he was acting strange?

397
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,800
What did you hear?

398
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,840
Someone saw you two

399
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
hugging each other.

400
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,680
Who is spreading this nonsense?

401
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:45,919
I'll break their legs!

402
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,239
If you two weren't hugging,

403
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
then he purposely

404
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,480
placed his hand over your mouth.

405
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,159
He was covering my mouth

406
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,639
so I wouldn't expose any
confidential information.

407
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,800
So he helped you put on a coat

408
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,239
for some reason?

409
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,320
Who is spreading these rumors?

410
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,639
I'll cut off their ears as a warning!

411
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,879
You're so anxious.

412
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,080
Are the rumors true?

413
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,720
Does it matter?

414
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:10,720
He said the ambush was a delivery.

415
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,919
No matter what he does, he will
never earn my trust again.

416
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
We can do this the nice way or the rough way.

417
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,560
What exactly happened during the ambush?

418
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,039
Would you believe me?

419
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,119
What about you?

420
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,159
Then I should leave.

421
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:36,919
Come back here.

422
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Even I who know nothing about military tactics

423
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,999
know no one would disguise
an ambush with a delivery.

424
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,279
Not to mention you're a general who knows

425
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,680
how to pull off the Empty Fort Strategy
and pretend to surrender.

426
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,039
The Empty Fort Strategy and pretending
to surrender were tactics indeed.

427
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,600
Until that day...

428
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,239
I was relieving a garrison.

429
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,560
I led them across the border in secrecy.

430
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,279
Why don't we have a bet?

431
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,320
If you can get General Mo's personal trinket,

432
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:00,879
each of us will give you 100 taels.

433
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,039
Yes.

434
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,399
Get your money ready.

453
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,999
On that day, I was the only one

454
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,239
who saw her weariness and loneliness.

455
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,919
I was also the first...

456
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:42,800
to admire her for the woman she is.

457
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,519
After that day,

458
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
I started to pay more attention to her.

459
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:48,759
I realized that

460
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,360
we share something in common.

461
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
Her determination on the battlefield

462
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,519
cannot conceal her weakness.

463
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,680
She can understand all of my strategies.

464
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,639
She can even stay one step ahead of me.

465
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,360
We are connected.

466
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,999
She has determination and generosity.

467
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,200
In other words,

468
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,840
she is like...

469
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,720
the other me.

470
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,919
The lemons are hanging on the tree,

471
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,399
under the tree, are you and me.

472
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,800
You and I?

473
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,639
Not you and I.

474
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,759
It's he and I.

475
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:28,600
He and you.

476
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,399
Carry on.

477
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,960
There was high tension at the border.

478
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,159
As part of the defensive forces,

479
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,360
I could do nothing.

480
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:37,800
When the tension receded,

481
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,960
there was an opportunity for a truce.

482
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,399
I thought

483
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,320
it was the right time to confess my love for her.

484
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,840
But Feng Yang finds you suspicious.

485
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,639
Whatever method you employ,

486
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,320
she will think it comes with a motive.

487
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,639
So I resorted to a desperate plan.

488
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,919
I wanted to give her my truce letter and

489
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:57,960
the present personally.

490
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,239
But she misunderstood it as an ambush.

491
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,919
So she retaliated.

492
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,600
Xiyue's troops lost.

493
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,080
And after the battle,

494
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,879
I lost my rank...

495
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,759
and was forced to have this peace-making marriage.

496
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,999
Your story sounds very miserable.

497
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,919
But it's not Feng Yang's fault for being paranoid.

498
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:23,119
Did you manage to give her the present?

499
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,800
I was in a rush,

500
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,239
I couldn't give her the present.

501
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,480
But after everything settled,

502
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,879
I tried my best

503
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,600
and found Feng Yang's personal servant.

504
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,800
I asked him to give her

505
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,600
the truce letter and the present
in the name of an admirer.

506
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,879
What was the present you gave her?

507
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,999
Feng Yang's old sword buckle was torn.

508
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,919
I asked around and found out

509
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,600
her favorite flower is balsam.

510
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,279
So I ordered

511
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,519
to have this pair of sword buckle made.

512
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,919
One for her,

513
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,639
the other is for me.

514
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,360
I've seen this sword buckle before.

515
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,999
Where did you see it?

516
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,800
Feng Yang carries it at her waist.

517
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,159
I've seen her wear it many times.

518
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,600
I have an idea.

519
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,680
You can't stay in the room all the time.

520
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,039
You'll become autistic.

521
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,239
You should come out and have a walk more often.

522
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,039
Admire the flowers and enjoy the fresh air.

523
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,519
Doing so can keep the wrinkles away.

524
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,159
I appreciate Your Highness's generosity.

525
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,039
But...

526
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,759
Sunlight! I'll hold the umbrella for you.

527
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,119
The sunlight isn't that bright.

528
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,759
It might rain later.

529
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,320
Let me do it.

530
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,480
Let me do it.

531
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,680
Let me.

532
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,039
Let me.

533
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,919
How dare you steal from me!

534
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,600
How can you prove this buckle belongs to you?

535
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,879
I carry it with me all the time.

536
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:14,919
You're clearly...

537
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,840
Where did you get it?

538
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,840
Where did you get yours?

539
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,080
It was a present.

540
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,399
It must be an admirer.

541
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,639
How do you know?

542
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,480
The buckles come in a pair.

543
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,519
They come in a pair?

544
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,720
You mean...

545
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,999
you gave me this buckle?

546
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,720
The container it was kept in

547
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,600
also has a truce letter in it.

548
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,840
Perhaps you never found it.

549
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
Where is the container now?

550
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,200
The Mo Residence.

551
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,119
It's simple.

552
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,999
Show everyone the container.

553
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,680
Everything will be clear.

554
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:25,161
(Truce Letter)

555
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
Was this the thing you were delivering?

556
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,480
Why did you hide the truce letter?

557
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,519
The King of Xiyue didn't know my plan.

558
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,999
I hid the letter to avoid further conflicts.

559
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,840
I made the wrong judgment

560
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,039
which led to a misunderstanding.

561
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Please accept my apologies.

562
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,439
This wasn't your fault.

563
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,999
I had wronged you.

564
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I will do my best

565
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,400
to prevent any misunderstanding from you.

566
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,080
But why did you give me a sword buckle?

567
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,679
It was for...

568
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,759
Peace!

569
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,120
It was a token of peace.

570
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,039
I think it's too much for Feng Yang to take in.

571
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,759
We should give her some space.

572
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,320
Yes.

573
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,759
You asked me

574
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,320
to give you an etiquette lesson.

575
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:57,679
We could start today.

576
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,959
This lesson is long overdue.

577
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,400
Let's go.

578
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:00,840
Come on.

579
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:01,719
Let's go.

580
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,279
Feng Yang, we'll leave you
to your contemplating.

581
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,519
This is weird.

582
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,479
The three of them are acting strange.

583
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,560
The misunderstanding has been resolved.

584
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,560
Why wouldn't you let me confess to her?

585
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:34,120
You're still the Main Prince Consort.

586
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,199
Feng Yang is very law-abiding.

587
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,999
Your reckless confession would
only scare her away.

588
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,600
If you want to win her heart,

589
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,719
you first need her to like you.

590
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,439
Only then will you have a chance.

591
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,600
Indeed.

592
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,880
All she thinks about are
tactics and military affairs.

593
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,640
It won't be easy to get her to like me.

594
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,560
If I remember correctly,

595
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,239
she said she liked gentle and
subtle men of Dongyue.

596
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,640
That's what bothers me the most.

597
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:24,920
Get rid of the beard,

598
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:25,640
do some threading,

599
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,640
then get a new hairstyle.

600
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,840
I, Master Tony Tan, will provide
one-stop services for you.

601
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,519
I will surely shape you into

602
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,320
a gentle and subtle man of Dongyue.

603
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,360
Not even your mother would recognize you.

604
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,320
Nonsense.

605
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,600
Men of Xiyue have their charismatic features.

606
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,519
Do not change yourself all for the sake of a woman.

607
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,719
Childish.

608
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,199
When you wooed me the last two times,

609
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:47,400
you groomed yourself with thick makeups,

610
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,560
like a peacock.

611
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,279
Otherwise, I wouldn't have fallen for you.

612
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
A peacock?

613
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,199
I would never do such a thing.

614
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,320
Now that we're married,

615
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,039
you're showing your true nature!

616
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,959
I never hide

617
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,439
my true nature.

618
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,199
You don't understand women!

619
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,999
Stop fighting.

620
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm the one wooing Feng Yang, right?

621
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:05,999
You can decide then.

622
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,080
I'll go with your plan first.

623
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,360
You asked for this.

624
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,880
Don't even think I'll save you later.

625
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,400
You made the right choice.

626
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,759
Don't worry. You can count on me.

627
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,759
Stay still.

628
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:39,640
Yes, that's it.

629
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,479
Put some strength into it.

630
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,160
Push harder.

631
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
I am pushing! It's not working!

632
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,120
Are you up for the job?

633
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,479
Yun Xiu.

634
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,120
Your curly hair is indeed hard to deal with.

635
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,160
Yu Hao, push harder.

636
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,199
I am pushing.

637
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,160
You're useless.

638
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,080
Leave it to me.

639
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Go ahead.

640
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:00,840
I'll be gentle.

641
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,800
Hold him still.

642
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,519
Look closely. This is the spot.

643
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,199
It's right here.

644
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,360
Now push.

645
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,679
I told you so.

646
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:11,959
How is this...

647
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,320
Push harder.

648
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,439
It won't work.

649
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,160
Push harder.

650
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,880
Yes.

651
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:20,560
All right.

652
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,360
It's done.

653
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay. Move on to the next.

654
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:23,080
Next.

655
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,679
There's more?

656
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,479
Yes. Come on.

657
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,039
Turn around.

658
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,439
Bear with it.

659
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,959
Must men of Dongyue go through

660
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,840
this torment just to look presentable?

661
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:39,920
Just bear with it.

662
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,360
Bear with it.

663
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,199
The mighty eagle

664
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,439
has turned into a peacock in a cage.

665
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,679
You got to be the peacock,

666
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,600
so why can't he be one too?

667
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,479
Is pleasing a woman more important
than being himself?

668
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,120
Maybe I'll find out if it's worth it

669
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,560
after Feng Yang sees me.

670
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,640
Didn't I give you a mission?

671
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,759
Why are still you here to spread
fallacies to deceive people?

672
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,519
Get out.

673
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,199
I...

674
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,360
Get out.

675
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,840
I have finished the mission.

676
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:22,679
Yun Xiu, a man dresses to
court with the lady he likes.

677
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,439
I know what girls like best.

678
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,759
After we've groomed you,

679
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,360
you will experience threading
for the first time.

680
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,160
It's so exciting.

681
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,679
Aren't you excited to try it out?

682
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,120
Are you ready?

683
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,840
Let's carry on.

684
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:42,840
