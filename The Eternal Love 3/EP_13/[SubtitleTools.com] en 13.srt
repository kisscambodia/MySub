Oh no.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,000
You.

19
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,520
"Why am I here?"

20
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,750
"Why did you still do it
while knowing the consequences?"

21
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm tired of imitating it.

22
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,360
Did Her Majesty agree to my request of repudiation?

23
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,870
"Thank you for your sympathy, Your Majesty."

24
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,720
"I'm well aware of the responsibility
I carry on my shoulders"

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,920
"and that I should not act recklessly."

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,920
I rejected it?

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,870
Once I regain my memory,

28
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,280
I always make things difficult for myself.

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
Do you want to divorce that badly?

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,950
Why?

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,640
I...

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,560
The reason is not important.

33
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,800
You were the one who asked
for my hand in marriage,

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,640
and now you are the one
who is asking me to let go of your hand.

35
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,950
But you won't even give me a reason for it?

36
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,160
Don't you think

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
that this is too unfair to me?

38
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,160
Princess.

39
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,440
Your Highness, many people
have gathered outside the residence,

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
making it difficult to leave
or enter the residence.

41
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,390
Why have they gathered here?

42
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,800
It's said that it has something to do with the New Law.

43
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,950
New Law?

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,590
Her Majesty hadn't agreed to it yet, had she?

45
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,580
(Princess's Residence)

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,470
Here comes Prince Consort.

47
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,080
Prince Consort is here.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,590
Come on.

49
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,640
Come on. Everyone, please make way.

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,360
Everyone, please make way.

51
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,000
Come on.

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,470
The two of us

53
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,440
thank you for your kindness, Young Master!

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,390
You are welcome.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,920
What is your elder brother here for?

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Young Master, after you
came back from the palace,

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,390
Her Majesty had announced the New Law.

58
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,560
The New Law states that all men have

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,360
the right to terminate their own marriages.

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,590
It has been said that

61
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,080
it's because of your request that
the New Law was announced.

62
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,160
Indeed, Prince Consort.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,870
I had been enduring
constant violence from my wife,

64
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,110
but had no way out.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
The announcement of the New Law

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,640
has saved my life.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
If it weren't for you,

68
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,830
my brother would still be in great pain.

69
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,310
Make way. Move. Move.

70
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,590
Make way. Make way.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,920
Come home with me!

72
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,840
In front of Princess and Prince Consort, there is
no place for you to act disrespectfully.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
Princess, Prince Consort.

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,430
This is our family affairs.

75
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,240
I'll settle it by myself.

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,200
Let's go!

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Let go!

78
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,680
Do you think that you can
put a stop to it just like that?

79
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,470
Princess, as you know,

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,150
if he leaves me,

81
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,120
he would drown in rumours
and gossip for the rest of his life.

82
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,840
That's true.

83
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,750
Should one be enduring the unfairness

84
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,990
just to have one's reputation be untainted?

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,360
Forgive me for asking, Second Princess.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,640
If Prince Consort wishes
to leave you no matter what,

87
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,470
would you agree to let him go or not?

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,150
If that is what he desires,

89
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,800
I would not stop him.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,520
Exactly!

91
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,960
Well-spoken!

92
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,310
Exactly! Well-spoken!

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Precisely! Exactly!

94
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,200
How does it feel

95
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,800
to have someone supporting you?

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Doesn't it feel thrilling?

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,920
What I just said,

98
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,400
especially the last sentence,

99
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,990
wasn't it amazing?

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,750
Look at you, asking for praise again.

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,680
But I suppose helping the disadvantaged

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,640
is easier than I thought.

103
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,310
If it weren't for Her Majesty's New Law,

104
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,520
it wouldn't have been this easy.

105
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,310
Besides, when I was at the imperial garden before,

106
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,920
Her Majesty didn't announce the New Law.

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,710
The sudden announcement of the New Law

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
must have some other meaning behind it.

109
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,400
Would you die if you say a word of praise to me?

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,550
You didn't have to make
the conversation about Her Majesty.

111
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
At this point,

112
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,270
I've almost forgotten why I asked
for a repudiation paper.

113
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,680
If this keeps happening,

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,240
Her Majesty would figure out the reason behind it.

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,360
Could it be that...

116
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,270
she is using me to combat the Mo Family?

117
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

118
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,710
I won't do it again.

119
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,920
You're as stubborn as a mule.

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,550
Did you really have to say thank you
in the most unlovable way?

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,400
Your Majesty,

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,360
I've found that

123
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,080
it's not only Qu Tan Er whose personality
had changed drastically.

124
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,120
Three months ago, Mo Lian Cheng suddenly fell ill.

125
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,400
After he recovered, he also
became more calculating.

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,550
I am well aware of his schemes.

127
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,270
But he broke the promise today,

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,430
which cannot be explained
by just his calculating nature.

129
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,800
What Mo Lian Cheng did today was truly a surprise.

130
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,920
It must be rather lively outside
Second Princess's residence today.

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,640
That is correct, Your Majesty.

132
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,520
By announcing the New Law would be passed

133
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,400
and spreading the word around about
Mo Lian Cheng's request to you,

134
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,150
there are quite the number of people who are
dissatisfied with the New Law

135
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,200
currently gathered
outside Second Princess's residence.

136
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,430
But

137
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,400
they were calmed by Mo Lian Cheng.

138
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,840
It seems that he really has changed.

139
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,550
It is just my lowly opinion but

140
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,400
I believe Mo Lian Cheng's actions

141
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,640
are all to plant doubts in Your Majesty's mind.

142
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,550
Ever since Mo Yuan Long found out
about the secret funds,

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,200
he has been on the move.

144
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,470
Mo Lian Cheng also used
his marriage with Second Princess

145
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,800
to his advantage.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,710
But little do they know,

147
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,520
the spotlight of this spectacle is not on them.

148
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,240
All praise thou might, Your Majesty.

149
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,310
There is still a lot of suspicion
that has yet to be confirmed.

150
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,520
If those two aren't just using each other,

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,400
but have formed an alliance,

152
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,710
together with the remaining power
of the Mo Family...

153
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,360
Then...

154
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,030
An alliance between husband and wife?

155
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,430
When the Tianji descends,

156
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,080
he will be mine.

157
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,110
My apologies, Your Majesty.

158
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,480
I was simply worried for Your Majesty's well-being.

159
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,160
Besides, if those two were to form an alliance,

160
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,870
they must not be underestimated.

161
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,990
Your Majesty, please allow me
to continue the investigation.

162
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,750
It is time for our appearance

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,990
in this spectacle.

164
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

165
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,600
Young Master! Young Master!

166
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,350
Young Master!

167
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,910
Please rise.

168
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
What happened?

169
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,280
After my brother left his wife,

170
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,550
our father was determined to send him
to the temples to become a monk.

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,670
Young Master! Young Master!

172
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,750
I am merely a man and have no one to rely on.

173
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,640
The land of Dongyue is vast,

174
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,670
yet there is no place for me in it.

175
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,080
Wouldn't this be falling short
of Young Master's expectations?

176
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,160
There, there.

177
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,310
You may rise.

178
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,790
Thank you, Young Master.

179
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,350
It seems that the New Law alone

180
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,350
is not able to change the fate of men.

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,640
Young Master, there is only my aggressive wife
that waits for me at my house.

182
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,990
I have nowhere to go.

183
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,400
Young Master, please save me!

184
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,550
I beg of you, please save me!

185
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,040
The New Law was passed because of me,

186
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
I must take responsibility.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,520
Her Majesty has invited
Secondary Prince Consort to the palace.

188
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,350
Her Majesty's actions last night

189
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,840
and her invitation...

190
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,400
what is the meaning of all this?

191
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,230
But the tough situation brought upon
by the New Law must be dealt with.

192
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,200
The flower is always

193
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,790
the most beautiful in a vase.

194
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,480
Truly a sight to behold,

195
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,280
but it is soulless.

196
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,790
Then do you think that

197
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,230
it would rather be under harsh sunlight and rain

198
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,600
until the end of its life?

199
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,040
I'm not a flower

200
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,310
and will never know what a flower thinks.

201
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,110
Then tell me,

202
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,870
when you asked for my help before,

203
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,790
was it for benefit of all men

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,080
or merely yourself?

205
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,160
The New Law benefits all men.

206
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,720
I asked for the New Law to be passed

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,080
for both the country and myself.

208
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,160
However, loopholes exist in the New Law.

209
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,750
If left unfixed, it would be detrimental.

210
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,110
What loophole?

211
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,280
Men that leave their wives,

212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,750
even if they are to succeed in doing so,

213
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,520
will be outcasted by society.

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,280
In the end, they become helpless and homeless.

215
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,110
If that is the case,

216
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
who would dare use the New Law?

217
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,790
How about

218
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,310
you gift men that comply with the New Law

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,080
some perfume sachets under my name,

220
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,840
as a sign of affirmation from me?

221
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,480
What do you think of it?

222
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,080
Such a brilliant idea, Your Majesty.

223
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,870
I'm greatly impressed by it.

224
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,400
Then you and I will make the sachets together.

225
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Tan.

227
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,110
Tan.

228
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,870
Tan.

229
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Tan, wake up! Tan!

230
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,280
Tan, wake up! Tan!

231
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Don't be afraid, Cheng Cheng. I'll protect you.

232
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Tan, wake up!

233
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,110
Secondary Prince Consort isn't here.

234
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
What?

235
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,350
I said Secondary Prince Consort isn't here.

236
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,870
No, wait.

237
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,640
I said Secondary Prince Consort
was called to the palace.

238
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,750
Called to the palace?

239
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,080
Did he go to meet Her Majesty?

240
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,840
Mo Lian Cheng,

241
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,160
what are your true thoughts?

242
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
When you made the Knots of Love with me before,

243
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,110
your hands were quite nimble.

244
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,750
But when it comes to making perfume sachets,

245
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,640
why are you so clumsy?

246
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,160
Knots of Love...

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,520
that must've happened before I lost my memory.

248
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,840
I apologize for my clumsiness.

249
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,040
I am no craftsman.

250
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,040
Your Majesty, please have mercy on me.

251
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,790
Hold it for me.

252
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,520
You're avoiding me.

254
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,790
I didn't want to get in the way of Your Majesty.

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,840
Do you remember what you said to me

256
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,600
when you made the Knots of Love
with me during the Lantern Festival?

257
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,160
Lantern Festival?

258
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,520
That was before I fell ill and lost my memory.

259
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,990
Your Majesty, you still remember?

260
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,310
You said that

261
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,720
the Knot of Love was strong

262
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,520
and unbreakable.

263
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,960
Your Majesty's care towards citizens

264
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,110
and connection with the world

265
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,400
are of course unbreakable.

266
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,230
I know what you are thinking.

267
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,040
I have already written the edict,

268
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,430
which clearly states the punishment and rewards

269
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,480
in order to encourage men
to remarry under the New Law.

270
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,040
But I think that

271
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,040
you should write a template of a repudiation paper

272
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,160
from a man's perspective as an example.

273
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,840
So it can be shown to all citizens
along with the edict.

274
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,480
There are some writing materials right beside you.

275
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,160
Although Her Majesty is hiding
her true reason for doing this,

276
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,670
I can only agree to it under the current situation.

277
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,990
I can protect my people,

278
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,110
so it's only natural
that I can protect those that I love.

279
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,840
This empathy shown by Your Majesty

280
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,430
will be forever remembered by all men.

281
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,700
(Repudiation paper)

282
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,360
By all men?

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,030
I thank Your Majesty.

284
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,550
I must hurry now.

285
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,030
I need to hand this sachet out immediately.

286
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,310
Not happy seeing me

287
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,840
going to the palace, Second Princess?

288
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,430
Her Majesty is already suspicious of
what happened last night.

289
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,310
Besides, it's not like I don't know

290
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,310
that Her Majesty has other motives.

291
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,200
Then why did you still go?

292
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

293
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,720
What to venture?

294
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
A glamorous life?

295
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,430
Do you think I'm the one to chase after glamour

296
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,910
and climb the social ladder?

297
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,550
Give heed!

298
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,240
By the grace of heaven's will,
Her Majesty hereby proclaims:

299
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,670
Prince Consort Mo Lian Cheng

300
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,000
is a man of kindness and bravery,

301
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,510
who knows of justice and integrity.

302
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
He is hereby awarded one thousand taels
of gold, ten rolls of cloth,

303
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,360
twenty pieces of jades,

304
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,360
five pairs of silverware,

305
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,150
and three sets of calligraphy tools.

306
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,150
That's all.

307
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
Come and accept the decree, Mo Lian Cheng.

308
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,670
I thank Her Majesty for her blessing.

309
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,880
Right, Her Majesty said

310
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,390
that you left in a hurry

311
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,550
after you made the perfume sachets with her

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,030
and forgot to take this.

313
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,510
Did you write this?

314
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes.

315
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,910
Yes?

316
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
But it's not what you think.

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Then why did you make
perfume sachets with Her Majesty?

318
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,910
And why did you write me this repudiation paper?

319
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,310

Tan,

356
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,960
Secondary Prince Consort broke
the seven types of grounds many times,

357
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,150
you didn't have the heart to repudiate him.

358
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,310
Why this time...

359
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,480
Who said I didn't have the heart to repudiate him?

360
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,840
I'll make him regret everything he has done

361
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,120
once he sees this.

362
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,550
But in my opinion,

363
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,240
that Secondary Prince Consort
is just being stubborn.

364
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
I can tell that

365
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,760
he still cares about you.

366
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,600
He cares?

367
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,480
If he cares, why would he

368
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
secretly meet his ex-girlfriend behind my back?

369
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,510
They were making perfume sachets together

370
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,430
and babbling on
about their nonsense relationship.

371
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Once he regains his memory,

372
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,000
I'll make him feel

373
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,760
remorse!

374
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
Go, take this to him.

375
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,120
Tell him that the divorce is effective
once he signs it.

376
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,100
(Divorce Agreement)
(Qu Xiao Tan repudiates Mo Lian Cheng)

377
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,310
This…

378
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,080
What's this?

379
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,790
Second Princess told me to give this to you.

380
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,910
You can just keep it, no need to sign.

381
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,310
(Divorce Agreement)
(Qu Xiao Tan repudiates Mo Lian Cheng)

382
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,270
Divorce agreement.

383
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,550
Qu Tan hereby divorces Mo Lian Cheng…

384
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,270
Young Master! Young Master!

385
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,880
The perfume sachet you gave me

386
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,150
was extremely useful!

387
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,150
When my father saw the perfume sachet
Her Majesty gave us

388
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,390
and the order from Her Majesty,

389
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,630
as well as the repudiation paper template,

390
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,270
he let my elder brother stay.

391
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,510
I thank you, Young Master, on my brother's behalf.

392
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,960
The perfume sachet
and the repudiation paper template

393
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,310
was for Brother Yu?

394
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,030
Yes.

395
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,000
Then this…

396
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,510
I will think about it

397
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,510
before I sign this.

398
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,270
I'll leave now.

399
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,150
Tan. Tan.

400
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,880
Did he sign it?

401
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,030
The perfume sachet

402
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,310
(Mo Lian Cheng)
and the repudiation paper template

403
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,200
(Mo Lian Cheng)
were for Yu Hao's elder brother.

404
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,030
His brother was almost forced
to leave and become a monk

405
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,910
so Secondary Prince Consort turned to Her Majesty.

406
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,880
That's what he meant by

407
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,390
nothing ventured, nothing gained.

408
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,720
But even if so,

409
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,910
he keeps distancing himself from me.

410
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,840
Then I'll give him what he wants.

411
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,310
Tan. Tan.

412
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,910
Now that we know

413
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,720
what happened at the palace
was a misunderstanding,

414
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,510
there must be some other reason

415
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,840
for Secondary Prince Consort
to coerce you like this.

416
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,720
He can't even bother to explain.

417
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
What other reason can he possibly have?

418
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,360
A reason that he cannot speak of.

419
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,510
But I already gave him the repudiation paper.

420
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,270
What's done is done.

421
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,430
Even if you've given it out,

422
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,630
you can still get it back.

423
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,960
If you two part ways because of a misunderstanding,

424
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,120
it would be hard to get him to return.

425
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,080
Then…

426
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,880
I'll take the repudiation paper back

427
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,510
and see if he has some other reason

428
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,310
afterwards.

429
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,200
You didn't want him to leave,

430
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,550
yet are so reluctant to admit it.

431
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,240
What did you say?

432
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,510
Nothing.

433
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,720
Cheng Cheng.

434
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,360
What?

435
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,840
The paper I gave you just now…

436
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,030
You want me to sign it as soon as possible?

437
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,910
No, no, no.

438
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,960
Then what?

439
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,630
I made too many spelling mistakes in that one.

440
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,030
I'll take that back

441
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,000
and give you a new one later.

442
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,880
No need.

443
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,310
I…

444
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,080
I don't want to... receive two
repudiation papers from you.

445
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,360
Can't you tell that

446
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm giving you a reason not to sign it?

447
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,790
Do you really want me to destroy it?

448
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Are you in this much of a hurry
to help me pack up my belongings?

449
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,790
I bought this one, you can't take it.

450
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,150
This one is the dowry, you can't take it either.

451
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
This one's mine.

452
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,390
I can at least take my own belongings

453
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,670
as souvenirs, can't I?

454
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
You've already signed it?

455
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,840
What? You don't want me to leave?

456
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,960
I almost cried tears of happiness.

457
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,430
Eighth Brother.

458
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,600
Here, sit.

459
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,760
Eighth Brother,

460
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
I heard you were successful.

461
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,550
Successful?

462
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,630
Exactly!

463
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,390
You got the repudiation paper
and received blessings from Her Majesty,

464
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,760
and even protected the reputation of the Mo Family.

465
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
Isn't that a great success?

466
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,840
A great success indeed.

467
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,120
Right.

468
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,030
These are all the valuables
I've collected over the years.

469
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,790
I was afraid that your life would be hard
after you leave the residence,

470
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,760
so I've prepared these for you.

471
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,720
But it seems like

472
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,360
your life in the future

473
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,030
will only be happier than now.

474
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,960
Eldest Brother, you don't have to do this.

475
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
Just take it.

476
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,390
Even if you marry into the royal family,
you would still need some savings of your own.

477
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,480
You never know what Her Majesty is thinking,

478
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
so you need to be prepared, just in case.

479
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,960
I think there are also some jewelry,

480
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,390
take those as well.

481
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,670
Why am I so anxious?

482
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,960
It's as if all of Eldest Brother's kindness

483
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,240
would be wasted by me.

484
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,600
Why does the future he speaks of

485
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,000
seem so distant?

486
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
Have I really thought of leaving?

487
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,360
Why are you so two-faced?

488
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,720
You were making excuses when you asked for a kiss,

489
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,840
and now you're making excuses to push me aside.

490
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,270
What do you want?

491
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,240
It was you who asked for my hand in marriage

492
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
but it is also you who is asking to leave me.

493
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,760
But you won't even give me a reason for it.

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,550
Don't you think that

495
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,390
this is too unfair to me?

496
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,390
Right now,

497
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,240
no matter what I say, it would seem powerless.

498
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,840
If I can do something to

499
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,000
make her realize

500
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,240
that I regret what I've done and want to stay,

501
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,720
how good would that be…

502
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,120
Until the very last moment,

503
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,150
I didn't serve her tea,

504
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,390
nor did I help her get dressed

505
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,390
like all other husbands do.

506
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,630
That may be my regret for eternity.

507
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,630
I wonder when he will

508
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,390
hand me the signed divorce agreement.

509
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,390
Can I not take it?

510
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,120
That's right!

511
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,150
I can just hide from him.

512
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,030
I need to find something to block the door.

513
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,600
That way he can't come in.

514
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,720
Your Highness.

515
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,910
Your Highness.

516
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,080
Please have some sleeping tea.

517
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Sleeping tea?

518
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,510
What's he up to?

519
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,510
If you keep pretending, the tea will be cold.

520
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,910
You're here?

521
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,910
He's not hiding the divorce agreement
in his hands, is he?

522
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,910
She wants me... to blow on the tea?

523
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,760
Is he serving me tea?

524
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,480
Your Highness.

525
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,360
You drank?

526
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,880
No.

527
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,390
How is the temperature?

528
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,670
Good, good.

529
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,390
It doesn't look like he's pulling a prank on me.

530
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,310
On the contrary, he seems to be
uncomfortable with himself.

531
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,840
You Highness, are you feeling too warm?

532
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,270
Then how about, I help you get changed?

533
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,910
Could it be that he also doesn't want a divorce?

534
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,910
You've already signed the agreement, right?

535
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,790
When are you giving it to me?

536
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,510
Are you in this much of a hurry?

537
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,790
If I don't hurry,

538
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,880
my hunky boy will become a cute little one.

539
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,760
I'll never

540
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
try to push you away again.

541
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,960
These past few days,

542
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,200
I've constantly worried

543
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,350
that my actions would hurt you.

544
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,390
It's my fault

545
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,110
for forcing you to let go.

546
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,480
I have never experienced heartache like this.

547
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,280
It felt like

548
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,760
my soul was being pulled out of my body.

549
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,960
It was as if the rest of my life,

550
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,960
no matter how much longer,

551
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,150
had become meaningless.

552
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,910
If you had known it would be like this,

553
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,200
why act as you did before?

554
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,390
Back then, I pushed you away

555
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,760
because

556
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
I had some concerns

557
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,960
about myself,

558
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,110
about my father,

559
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,630
and about Dongyue.

560
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,390
I had felt like

561
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,720
going on my way

562
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
while being surrounded by overwhelming darkness.

563
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,430
I can take the risk myself,

564
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,390
but if

565
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,800
I were to put you in danger,

566
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,240
I would never

567
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,800
forgive myself.

568
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,040
You underestimated me.

569
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,590
Are you saying that I can't even
protect my own husband?

570
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
Your Highness is highly skilled.

571
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,240
I'll apologize

572
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,870
with a kiss.

573
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,800
Then you have to make things clear.

574
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,520
Leaving things like this isn't okay.

575
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,960
You can't repudiate me.

576
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm Princess, it's my call.

577
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,520
Say that again?

578
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,480
How dare you?

579
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,280
And?

580
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,040
Still have something to say?

581
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,350
Fine, fine, fine.

582
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
I won't repudiate you anymore.

583
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,390
I'm no longer going to repudiate you,

584
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,320
but what if

585
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,040
you keep grouching

586
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,150
over the agreement?

587
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,070
Then I

588
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,000
will be at Your Highness's mercy.

589
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,070
The agreement,

590
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,960
the agreement is now nullified.

591
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,670
Do you like me because you don't want to leave me

592
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,910
or do you not want to leave me because you like me?

593
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,040
I like you,

594
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,630
so I can't leave you.

595
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,520
I found out how much I like you

596
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,480
because I can't leave you.

597
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,870
I like you so much that I feel anxious;

598
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,760
I like you so much that I'm afraid;

599
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,070
I like you so much

600
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,110
that I can't be honest with myself.

601
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,200
I thought I would stop liking you
if I buried my head in the sand,

602
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,590
but when I did,

603
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,560
I started hoping that you wouldn't let me go.

604
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,110
Is the flush on your face

605
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,830
due to drunkenness or bashfulness?

606
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,630
I'm not drunk.

607
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,560
As for bashfulness...

608
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,870
Let's be bashful together.

609
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,960
Alright, stop it.

610
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,800
Of course I like you.

611
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
I like you so so much.

612
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,960
Each passing minute,

613
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,590
I've been afraid you'll
lose your original memories,

614
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,110
and because of that, you'll stop loving me.

615
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
It's not a problem anymore.

616
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,150
You've finally come back to me.

617
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,560
But I don't have my original memories,

618
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,800
do you mind?

619
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,960
I'll definitely help you remember everything.

620
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,390
We've been through life and death together,

621
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,390
we've confessed our love so many times,

622
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,000
we've made so many thrilling memories,

623
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,560
how can I let you forget all of these?

624
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,910
True.

625
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,000
I've lost my previous memories.

626
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,670
I've only heard things from you.

627
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,590
Thinking of it, it's quite a shame.

628
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,320
Then...

629
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,910
do you like the me right now

630
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,240
or do you like the me from before?

631
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,520
You've lost your memories,

632
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,040
but you are still you.

633
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,910
Do you really need to ask?

634
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,720
I got jealous.

635
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,560
You have always been the jealous type.

636
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,390
No need to be jealous.

637
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
Just try to get your memories back.

638
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,000
