(So this is what it feels like)

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,160
(to have my lifelong dream come true.)

18
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
(I feel sorry for Eighth Brother,)

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,030
(but tonight will be a sleepless night)

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,160
(for Tan Er and me.)

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,830

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,880
Cheng Cheng?

24
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,160
Come on out, Cheng Cheng.

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Where are you?

26
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,000
Cheng Cheng? Cheng Cheng?

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,160
Hiding from me, huh?

28
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,110
Cheng Cheng!

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,390
Come out, Mo Lian Cheng!

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,630
Mo Lian Cheng! Mo Lian Cheng!

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,110
Come out, Mo Lian Cheng!

32
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,360
What happened, Your Highness?

33
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,720
Quick, go and find him...

34
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,550
Find the prince consort!

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,910
Ah Gui, get some people

36
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,800
to find the prince consort.

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
Quick. You guys search over there!

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
Hurry, hurry! Find the prince consort!

39
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,630
- Prince Consort! Prince Consort!
- Prince Consort!

40
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,190
Mo Lian Cheng!

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,000
Mo Lian Cheng!

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,160
Come out!

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,190
Come out, Mo Lian Cheng!

44
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,440
Mo Lian Cheng!

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,600
Your Highness.

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are you here?

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,270
Eldest Brother.

48
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,950
Mo Lian Cheng!

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
Mo Lian Cheng!

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
Come out!

51
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,350
(Even if Her Highness finds me,)

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,350
(I'm sure she won't do anything
with Eldest Brother around.)

53
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,440
(But how can I convince Eldest Brother
to let me stay?)

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,440
Don't sit...

55
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,790
Eldest Brother.

56
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,070
I can't stay in that room any longer.

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,920
Why?

58
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,600
It's normal to feel nervous on your wedding night.

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,270
Aren't you nervous, Eldest Brother?

60
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,600
All men have to go through this.

61
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,070
I may be nervous,

62
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,920
but I'm looking forward to it as well.

63
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,270
I'm afraid I can't feel that way.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,350
Don't worry, Eighth Brother.

65
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,160
You don't have to worry about tonight.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,920
It is me...

67
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,270
who will need to concentrate and ensure
that I am ready for it.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Why don't I concentrate with you?

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,270
That may make me feel better.

70
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,920
Eighth Brother, you don't need to do this.

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,070
Eldest Brother,

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
no need to be so courteous.

73
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,920
I am willing to do it.

74
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,200
Eighth Brother, Tan Er will be here soon.

75
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,230
Let's not talk any further.

76
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,550
Go back to your room and rest.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,950
Eldest Brother, I need more time...

78
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,390
Why don't... both of you carry on?

80
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,440
Tan Er, Eighth Brother only came
to keep me company.

81
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,510
He'll be leaving right away.

82
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,880
Yes, he'll leave right now.

83
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,480
Go on... Go. Go!

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,880
I won't!

85
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,390
Go now.

86
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,950
I won't.

87
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,600
Go back.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
- Go back...
- No need!

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,390
No need.

90
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,320
It's alright. I'm not in a hurry.

91
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,230
I'll leave first. You guys have fun.

92
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Tan Er.

93
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,440
What about... I leave first?

94
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,830
I shall not interrupt your fun.

95
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,950
Please enjoy yourselves.

96
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,270
Eighth Brother, are you all right?

97
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,670
I'll have Yu Hao send you back to your room.

98
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
You... I...

99
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,040
Are you alright?

100
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
No!

101
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
What's wrong with your head?

102
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,830
Don't come near me, Eldest Brother.

103
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,880
She... She...

104
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,480
Don't look at us like that!

105
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,720
Don't think I don't know what's
going on in your mind?

106
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,350
Tan Er!

107
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,550
Eighth Brother!

108
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,110
What are you doing?

109
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,390
Because I went to your brother's room?

110
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,720
If so, why did you hide in his room then?

111
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,760
Mo Lian Cheng,

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,920
you've gone too far.

113
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Can't you be serious for once?

114
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,760
If you keep thinking those thoughts,

115
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,070
I'll have to do something extreme

116
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,320
to get you to stop fantasizing.

117
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,760
"Fantasizing"?

118
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,640
"Fantasizing"?

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,790
Cheng Cheng, is it really you?

120
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,710
Still laughing?

121
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,080
You aren't reflecting at all.

122
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,080
Wait.

123
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,400
You realized it too?

124
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,710
What sort of rule is that?

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,320
You turned back the moment I kiss you.

126
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,710
You want to kiss me that badly?

127
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,470
I thought all you cared about was your son.

128
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,350
I wonder if Yu Er was harmed
by the Soul-guarding Bead.

129
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,280
What if we can never go back?

130
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,640
The final memories Yu Er had of us

131
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,590
were his parents arguing.

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,550
Would he think that we didn't love
each other anymore?

133
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,320
Nonsense.

134
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,110
Don't worry.

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,960
I will definitely bring you back.

136
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,000
But my current condition...

137
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,550
I don't know if it was caused by
the Soul-guarding Bead.

138
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
But I have memory lapses.

139
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
I can't always protect you.

140
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,520
Fortunately, I...

♪Carried by the wind, our love falls to the ground♪

Let's just take it...

146
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,960
that I've kissed you already, all right?

147
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,230
With the way things are right now...

148
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,280
I don't know how to cheer you up.

149
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,710
No way.

150
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,960
You have to try to overcome
the obstacles you encounter.

151
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,550
What's this for?

152
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,670
We can use this handkerchief to cover you.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,080
That would work, wouldn't it?

154
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,350
This red handkerchief is just like the red veil.

155
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,670
Wouldn't it suit you better?

156
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,640
Today, you are marrying into the bride's family.

157
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,710
Not the other way around.

158
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,350
Dear husband.

159
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,110
Dear "wife"?

160
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,790
Which should I call you?

161
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,980

166
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,620

167
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,780
♪Like the silk from the chrysalis

♪Our fates will forever remain entangled♪

169
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,670
Your Majesty has had him
become the prince consort.

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,960
Why do you have to be upset over the matter now?

171
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,910
It is unlike you to surmise my thoughts.

172
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,110
Indeed.

173
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,280
What matters most is the second princess
right now.

174
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,880
Not the eighth young master of the Mo family.

175
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,880
It may be more appropriate

176
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,760
to marry him off to the second princess

177
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,640
rather than have him enter the harem.

178
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,200
She was willing to take in Mo Lian Cheng.

179
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,760
That is exactly what I want to see.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,790
Your Majesty's illness acted up again.

181
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,470
Was it because you witnessed
their marriage yesterday?

182
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
You mustn't allow yourself to
fall in love, Your Majesty.

183
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,150
There is no one that could make me fall for them.

184
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,910
How would I even fall in love?

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,790
However, it is hard not to think of him

186
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,400
when I see something like that.

187
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
Where is the Soul Parting Flute?

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,550
It's here.

189
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,280
This flute...

190
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,640
was originally a magic tool meant to kill.

191
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,080
But somehow it is now being used to save lives.

192
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,340
(Princess’s Residence)

193
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,590
What exactly happened last night?
How could I have...

194
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,440
Eighth Brother.

195
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,200
Eldest Brother.

196
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,470
Here. I prepared this for you.

197
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,550
Have it while it's hot.

198
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,150
Tonic soup?

199
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,590
It was your first time.

200
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,030
You need to replenish your body.

201
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,350
Eldest Brother,

202
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,790
after I went to your room last night, I...

203
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,520
I don't blame you. You don't need to explain.

204
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,440
Eldest Brother, I didn't...

205
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,520
You don't have to explain. I understand.

206
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,400
However, please do not

207
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,760
take Her Highness away by force
from my room again.

208
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,470
Think about what other people would say

209
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,280
if they caught wind of this?

210
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,840
Took her away from your room?

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
By force?

212
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,280
Jing Xin.

213
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,910
You...

214
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,590
Fourteenth Young Master, swords are dangerous.

215
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
You should be careful.

216
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,440
You... What were you looking at?

217
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,470
I'm having a melon.
[*Internet slang for gossip]

218
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,280
I asked you what you were looking at.

219
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,790
It means to be an onlooker. Gossiping.

220
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,910
It's a new word I learned from Her Highness.

221
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
What were you guys looking at?

222
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
What were you looking at?

223
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,790
I don't know.

224
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,550
What about you guys?

225
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,470
We're having a melon.

226
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,910
I'm curious as to how Her Highness
and my eldest brother

227
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,350
are getting along in the Frost Court?

228
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,280
Her Highness wasn't in the Frost Court.
What melon were you having?

229
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,350
She's in the Xue Court.

230
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,760
My young master went to the Frost Court.

231
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,230
And Her Highness followed him to the Frost Court.

232
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,350
This...

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,200
Of... Of course I know about that!

234
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,470
They are still in the Frost Court, right?

235
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,520
They went back to the Snow Court together.

236
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
And you guys don't know this too.

237
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,910
The main prince consort went to
the Snow Court just now too.

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,150
So what exactly were the two of you looking at?

239
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,840
- This...
- This...

240
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,000
- Mo Lian Cheng!
- You must be careful.

241
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,110
It's all your fault.

242
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,640
My back still hurts.

243
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,280
Your Highness, you should
take good care of your body.

244
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,950
Someone

245
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,520
should take better care of my body.

246
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,800
He shouldn't let it

247
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,800
get to his head and do something that hurts my back.

248
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,880
(Last night, Cheng Cheng returned to himself
when he and Mo Yan Chen)

249
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,830
(touched.)

250
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,000
(I remember that happened before as well.)

251
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,430
(He would react when he comes into contact
with a blood relative.)

252
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,760
(Could the key to turning him back
lie with Mo Yan Chen?)

253
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,110
(Let's give it a try.)

254
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,070
Are you guys having soup?

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
The secondary prince consort is healthy.

256
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,470
It'd be a waste for him to have it.

257
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
He doesn't need it.

258
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,640
Why don't you have it instead?

259
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,430
Why are you still standing there?

260
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
Bring it over.

261
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,040
You must be careful.

262
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,920
Don't spill it on the main prince consort.

263
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,710
I'll do it. Come on.

264
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,040
Cheng Cheng?

265
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,830
(Cheng Cheng the heck.)

266
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,950
(Grumpy and mean.)

267
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,160
(He definitely didn't turn back
into my Cheng Cheng.)

268
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,680
(Why did it fail again?)

269
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,430
Eldest Brother, it's all my fault.

270
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,920
I wasted the soup you made for me.

271
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,040
It's all right. There's always next time.

272
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,470
Since we won't be having the soup,

273
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,760
let's depart then.

274
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,350
To where?

275
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,280
Tan Er. You forgot?

276
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,800
We're supposed to go back to
visit our families today.

277
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,950
Oh, right.

278
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,470
I must still be sleepy.

279
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,950
Why don't you go back and get ready first?

280
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,310
All right. Please excuse me then.

281
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,190
Yun Ying.

282
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,590
Why did you trip my brother earlier?

283
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,830
You need evidence before you
can slander someone.

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,950
Why would I need...

285
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,710
See.

286
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,640
So you admit you were slandering me, right?

287
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,070
I can't be bothered with you.

288
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,830
Make sure you don't talk too much when we
return to the Mo Residence.

289
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,560
To avoid unnecessary trouble.

290
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,760
We're just going back to visit your family, aren't we?

291
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,430
I know how things work.

292
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,160
You better mind your own business.

293
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,710
And respect me.

294
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,560
Otherwise, you'll have to deal with your sister.

295
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,400
Welcome, Your Highness.

296
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,160
Please have a seat.

297
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,560
What's the matter?

298
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,230
Father, Tan Er accidentally
hurt her back last night.

299
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,520
Quick, get a cushion for Her Highness.

300
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,400
Yes, My Lord.

301
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,470
No need.

302
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,680
No need for that.

303
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Why were you so careless?

304
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,190
To have let Her Highness hurt her back
on your wedding night.

305
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,040
It wasn't Eldest Brother. It was me.

306
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,710
Both of you better be more careful
from now on.

307
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,350
Her Highness is royalty.

308
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,760
Why wasn't Your Highness

309
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,400
in the main prince consort's room
on your wedding night?

310
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,710
Feng Yang, what does that matter?

311
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,950
I was the one who dragged Her Highness
away by force

312
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,160
from Eldest Brother's room last night.

313
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,190
It had nothing to do with Her Highness
and Eldest Brother.

314
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Don't you think you involve yourself
too much, General Mo?

315
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,430
Please do not be angry, Your Highness.

316
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,470
Feng Yang has been away on the battlefield
for a long time.

317
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,400
She may be a bit brash and reckless with her words.

318
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,880
Since we're on this topic,

319
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,070
I'll have to make things clear.

320
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,590
I slept alone last night.

321
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,230
Without any of the consorts in my bed.

322
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,560
Who is it?

323
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,830
I should have expected this.

324
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,230
In the Princess's Residence,

325
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,880
only the princess would do such a thing.

326
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,400
You turned back?

327
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,470
I hadn't expected this at all.

328
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,950
Hadn't expected what?

329
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,230
I never expected that I would be
a victim of domestic violence!

330
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,280
In a matriarchal society, even.

331
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,760
Your Highness was the one who acted crudely first.

332
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,000
I didn't make the first move to kiss you!

333
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,520
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

334
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,560
What are you doing?

335
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,470
I can't walk.

336
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,310
Take me back to your room.

337
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,710
Why do you want to go to my room?

338
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,560
I'll have Jing Xin send you back.

339
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,520
How are you going to explain this to Jing Xin?

340
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm not going to cover up for you.

341
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,310
I feel awful...

342
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,310
My consort

343
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,590
is not someone that anyone can just
criticize and slander.

344
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,590
Neither do they need an outsider
to teach them what to do.

345
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,640
Mr. Mo.

346
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,710
We've come to greet you today.

347
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,400
I will be bringing my two consorts

348
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,520
back with me now then.

349
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
We'll take our leave.

350
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Seeing you off, Your Highness.

351
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,110
Tan Er.

352
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,070
(So I can get the best of both worlds.)

353
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,520
(She got into an argument with Feng Yang for my sake.)

354
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,920
(I should be nicer to her.)

355
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,950
(Tan Er loves me, after all.)

356
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,590
Here.

357
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,920
She got into an argument

358
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,230
with Mo Feng Yang for Mo Lian Cheng.

359
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,110
What is she trying to play up now?

360
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,590
Could it be that she is pretending that she is
on bad terms with the Mo family?

361
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,590
Pretending?

362
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,470
Does that mean she is trying to hide the fact
that they have formed an alliance?

363
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,070
Your Majesty, you mean...

364
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,310
I haven't sent Tan Er's wedding gift to her yet.

365
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,070
Why don't...

366
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,470
I send her a grand gift?

367
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,830
A pair of red corals.

368
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,190
A pair of silver bangles.

369
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,680
Six pieces of jade accessories.

370
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,710
Two pairs of rings.

371
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,110
Rolls of fabric...

372
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,590
What is all of this? Who sent them?

373
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,350
Your Highness,

374
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,000
these are wedding gifts sent to you
from Her Majesty.

375
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,110
Her Majesty has also said that
as you are newly-wedded,

376
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,400
there is no need for you to enter
the palace to thank her.

377
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,560
Her Majesty does hold Tan Er in high regard.

378
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,520
Her Majesty is very generous.

379
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,920
Yu Hao,

380
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,920
take inventory of the gifts.

381
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,920
Make a record and report it to me.

382
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,310
That'd make me happy too.

383
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,190
Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280
There is also a very special gift.

385
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,400
Her Majesty has ordered

386
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,280
that I must hand it to you in person.

387
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,230
What is it?

388
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,400
Tan Er seems to like it very much.

389
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,680
It's nothing special.

390
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,640
Put it together with the other gifts.

391
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,830
But don't open it.

392
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,280
And there's no need to make a record of it.

393
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,230
Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,800
All right.

395
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,350
We got into an argument today.

396
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,430
It's been a long day.

397
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,680
Go back and rest.

398
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,590
Take a good rest, everyone.

399
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,680
Why are you still here?

400
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,040
Thank you for what you did today.

401
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
I didn't do it entirely for you either.

402
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,350
She was being rude.

403
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,680
I couldn't stand it.

404
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,190
So I refuted her.

405
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,520
Still, thank you.

406
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,830
Not only for speaking up for me,

407
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,710
but I admire your words and view as well.

408
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,470
If you really want to thank me,

409
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,830
then why don't you carry me back to my room

410
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,710
to show your gratitude?

411
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,280
I shall not bother you any further then,
Your Highness.

412
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,860
You won't send me back.

413
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,800
Are you afraid that you won't be able
to control yourself

414
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,160
once you get into my room?

415
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,070
Or that I might force you?

416
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,280
All right.

417
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,830
I am curious as well.

418
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,230
As to why Your Highness thinks that
I wouldn't be able to control myself.

419
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,950
And what you think you could force me to do.

420
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,280
Please.

421
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,110
I've sent you back.

422
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,430
What else does Your Highness have in mind?
Please hurry up and do it now.

423
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,000
The sky is still bright outside.
What are you afraid of?

424
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,590
Come over here and serve me some tea.

425
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,110
Your Highness doesn't have any new tricks at all.

426
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,950
You still haven't learned anything despite
having tea spilled on you many times.

427
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,400
You give it a try then.

428
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
If you get me wet,

429
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,640
I'll just have you help me change my clothes.

430
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,800
You touched my hand when I served you tea.

431
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,160
If your clothes got wet, you'd have me
help you change.

432
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,310
Does Your Highness intend

433
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,000
to push me up against a wall next?

434
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,880
It's a bit old-fashioned, but it's classic.

435
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,710
So what if I try it out a few more times?

436
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,590
You forgot that you aren't tall enough.

437
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,640
Am I tall enough now?

438
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,190
Your Highness, please don't waste your energy.

439
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,880
The problem between you and me

440
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,560
is truly not a matter of height.

441
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,950
(The imperial token?)

442
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,110
Does Your Highness really like me that much?

443
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,110
I do, but it's a waste of effort.

444
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,280
Ungrateful.

445
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,590
I'd like to tour around the lake
on the outskirts tomorrow.

446
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,230
Would Your Highness permit me to do so?

447
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,230
You'll have to bring me along with you.

448
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,950
Then Your Highness

449
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,520
will have to bring my eldest brother along as well.

450
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,640
We'll split up then.

451
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,160
And meet up at the lake.

452
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,190
All right.

453
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,040
Jing Xin, what time is it?

454
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,350
Why isn't he here yet?

455
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,680
If we had known that we'd have to wait so long,

456
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,830
why did we have to come so early?

457
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't get it.

458
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,000
We're all staying in the same residence.

459
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,950
Why do we have to split up to come here?

460
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,400
You don't get it.

461
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,310
Waiting can be a fascinating thing.

462
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Especially when you know

463
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,880
that he'll definitely come.

464
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,430
He's here. Here they come.

465
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,000
Jing Xin.

466
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,920
Make sure you watch me flirt with him
and learn from me.

467
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,640
You can use it on Fourteenth next time.

468
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,110
Don't talk nonsense.

469
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,350
Tan Er, sorry for making you wait so long.

470
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,230
Eighth Brother indeed did it on purpose.

471
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,520
Why? Are you disappointed?

472
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,470
(It's fine that I feel disappointed.)

473
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,520
(But why should I make him feel bad too?)

474
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,280
(It's not his fault.)

475
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,190
Of course not.

476
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,350
I invited both of you.

477
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,560
But he didn't come...

478
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,000
It must be because

479
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
he has something even more important to attend to.

480
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,230
But since we're here,

481
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,680
let's have fun and enjoy ourselves.

482
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,560
Let's forget about all the unpleasant things,

483
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
okay?

484
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,880
As long as you're happy.

485
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,590
What do you mean by that?

486
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,000
Please don't keep everything to yourself.

487
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,590
Say what you feel.

488
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,920
Do what you want to do.

489
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,160
Your own happiness is the most important thing.

490
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,310
Let's go over there and see what
fun things we can do.

491
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,590
Come on.

492
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,950
(The imperial token can allow my father
to direct the border troops)

493
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,400
(and do great things.)

494
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,230
(I'm sorry, Your Highness.)

495
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,110
The air is so fresh here.

496
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,840
Tan Er.

497
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,080
I'd like to show you my sword dance.

498
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,000
You were always so happy when you
saw me perform back then.

499
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,280
Seeing you being happy makes me happy.

500
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,360
Jing Xin, give the prince consort your sword.

501
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,630
He's not bad at all.

502
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,870
Much better than you.

503
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,040

Eighth Brother must have come late
because he was held up.
