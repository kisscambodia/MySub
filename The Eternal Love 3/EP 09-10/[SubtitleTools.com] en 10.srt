16
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,300
Do you feel sleepy?

17
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,250
Not at all.

18
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,860
Then come with me.

19
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,140
Let's go.

20
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,330
Take this.

21
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,090
Face my sword!

22
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,700
You can't keep pulling your punch.

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,220
You need to strike.

24
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,780
Otherwise, I can't improve.

25
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,810
I can't become the greatest.

26
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,580
Again!

27
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,580
They are practicing swordplay here.

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
(Princess's Residence)

29
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,420
What?

30
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,500
Are you preparing a little excitement...

31
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,090
before our bedtime?

32
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,370
You've been training day and night lately.

33
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,020
As a token of my admiration,

34
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,140
I prepared this new sword for Your Highness.

35
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,450
Let's go.

36
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,940
Where to?

37
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,330
To practice swordplay in the yard of course.

38
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,140
I will gladly accept...

39
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,140
this beautiful sword.

40
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,170
However,

41
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,530
I'm not in a mood for practice today.

42
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,940
Then what do you want to do?

43
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,020
This stance

44
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,020
can strengthen your core muscles,

45
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,700
increasing your stability.

46
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,700
I'll start.

47
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,210
Sorry.

48
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,970
I can't do it anymore.

49
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,340
Thirty-seven.

50
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,930
Thirty-eight.

51
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,250
Thirty-nine.

52
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,020
(Didn't know this trick would be this handy.)

53
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,930
No, I'm exhausted.

54
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,860
(Why is he so shy?)

55
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,860
(I thought you're great at flirting.)

56
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,020
Hold.

57
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,970
The test is tomorrow.

58
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,420
I will never embarrass you.

59
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,340
No, I feel so sleepy.

60
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,740
Get up. Stop pretending.

61
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,490
That's all for today.

62
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,020
Accept whatever will come to pass.

63
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,210
She's really asleep.

64
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,340
But the look on you when you're asleep...

65
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,340
is quite adorable.

66
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
(Mo Residence)

67
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,930
The army of 20,000 strong is assembled
in the suburb.

68
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,970
The Wei Clan is willing

69
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,090
to provide us with the provision and weapons

70
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,460
as a token of goodwill.

71
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,490
Wei Qian Mo finally has lost patience.

72
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,050
Everything is in place.

73
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,490
As long as we have the imperial token,

74
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,810
we can finish off the enemies.

75
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,650
Very well.

76
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,140
You may leave now.

77
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,180
Yes.

78
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,770
You are four hours late.

79
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,140
Finishing off the enemies?

80
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,770
How bold of her.

81
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,860
You heard the conversation.

82
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,530
What do you think?

83
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,250
Father, don't you think it's odd

84
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,020
that Her Majesty granted the second princess
the imperial token?

85
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,490
The second princess is gaining
a lot of attention now.

86
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,580
The imperial token must be a test

87
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,900
of her ambition.

88
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,930
Does it matter?

89
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Her Majesty might never suspect you.

90
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,900
But now,

91
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,620
the second princess and I are in the same boat.

92
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,140
It's normal Her Majesty would be wary of me.

93
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,090
It's all the more reason to take swift action.

94
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,370
The longer this goes on, the more obstacles we face.

95
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,250
But recklessness will cost us everything.

96
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,180
If you still have loyalty for me,

97
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,420
then prove it with your action.

98
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,490
My devotion for the country...

99
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,580
has never wavered.

100
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,540
Oh no, I'm so nervous.

101
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,100
Tan, calm down.

102
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,050
Lately

103
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,100
you've been practicing day and night.

104
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,580
You've become more robust.

105
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,700
You can surely overcome the test with ease.

106
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,170
You sure I'm more robust now?

107
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,340
My arms are beefy?

108
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,140
Oh, no.

109
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,490
I don't want to be a muscular barbie.

110
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,410
But even so,

111
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,930
why am I still not confident

112
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,460
that I can defeat General Lu?

113
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,220
General Lu is indeed...

114
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,170
a little...

115
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,850
But fear not.

116
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,140
All the best. You can do it.

117
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,490
I'll return with good news.

118
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:36,930
Tan.

119
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,460
I should get going.

120
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,290
All the best.

121
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,610
You're...

122
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,610
This is your final test.

123
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,810
So it's normal to be nervous.

124
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,340
I can accompany Your Highness

125
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,370
to the palace.

126
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,660
You said I couldn't leave you,

127
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,900
but I bet you can't bear to leave me either.

128
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,780
Feel free to take the test alone

129
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,290
and hope for the best.

130
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,780
Want to leave? No way.

131
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
We'll begin the test of swordplay.

132
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,930
Your Highness resorted to some petty trick,

133
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,370
but you tried your best.

134
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,810
You have potential.

135
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,490
Her Majesty is away today.

136
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,730
I was ordered to supervise the test

137
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,100
and observe the fruition of
Your Highness's training.

138
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,980
But I didn't expect that in mere ten days

139
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,850
Your Highness's stamina and skills
have improved significantly.

140
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,850
Her Majesty will be glad to know this.

141
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,610
Much obliged, Official Xiao and General Lu.

142
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,020
(Where is he?)

143
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,460
(He finally took the initiative to come with me,)

144
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,610
(could it be...)

145
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,540
Why are you here?

146
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,410
I know what you're up to.

147
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,050
You must never touch the imperial token.

148
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,410
This has nothing to do with you.

149
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,370
I must take you with me!

150
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,020
Your Highness must be lost.

151
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,490
Eighth Young Master is here too.

152
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,610
What secret would require both of you

153
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,980
to come to the royal bedroom?

154
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,810
You worthless fool!

155
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,900
Your ruined my plan!

156
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,370
What plan could it be

157
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,610
that would require both of you to break into
Her Majesty's bedroom?

158
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,460
It's nothing serious.

159
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,540
Don't take this wrongly.

160
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,900
I was actually...

161
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,980
stealing something.

162
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,780
I...

163
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,290
I drank the tonic soup Her Majesty gifted me.

164
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,660
So I feel I've become stronger

165
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,410
and more refreshed. I even had a better appetite.

166
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,810
The martial art training became
a piece of cake for me.

167
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,250
So I thought...

168
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,410
it must be the tonic's effect.

169
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,020
So Your Highness is here
to steal the prescription.

170
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,410
Yes.

171
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,700
I admit.

172
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,980
I have ambitions.

173
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,930
I wish to devote my life to serving Dongyue.

174
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,780
But if my body is too frail to fight,

175
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,170
I'm afraid I can't realize my ambition.

176
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,370
But because the tonic was meant
for Her Majesty,

177
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,020
I knew I didn't have the right to request it.

178
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,050
I have been blinded by greed.

179
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,220
I asked my prince consort to steal it.

180
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,460
(She used herself as a scapegoat.)

181
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,810
Coveting Her Majesty's belonging
is no petty crime.

182
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,220
I must report to Her Majesty.

183
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,900
Both of you will wait outside the royal
study for punishment.

184
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,370
You are so obsequious!

185
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,100
Is this even worth reporting?

186
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,580
She stole my prescription?

187
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,220
It's time to teach her a lesson
to make her behave.

188
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,020
From what I saw,

189
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,100
they were defending each other.

190
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,930
Perhaps the second princess knows about
the Mo family's conspiracy.

191
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,580
She pawned the imperial token to fool me.

192
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,540
And now she lied about stealing a prescription.

193
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,020
Her actions indeed are very suspicious.

194
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
(Imperial Token)

195
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,900
Keep this safe.

196
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,490
The Mo family can't cause us any trouble for now.

197
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,660
We must wait and see.

198
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,980
Yes.

199
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,930
Your Majesty. I am willing to take the punishment
on Her Highness's behalf!

200
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,700
Cheng Cheng.

201
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,050
I'm fine.

202
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,930
Your Majesty. I am willing to take the punishment
on Her Highness's behalf!

203
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,220
A message from Her Majesty.

204
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,890
The prince consort lacks manners.

205
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,010
The second princess must be punished with
ten lashes and reflect on her mistake.

206
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,460
This is my fault.

207
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,760
♪Like the wind, I♪

208
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,320
♪I'm banished to the end of time♪

209
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,760
♪I can't hold onto the dream♪

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,200

♪Your arrogance is manifesting♪

212
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,890
You didn't have to do that.

213
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,410
Consider this...

214
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,130
a silver lining.

215
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,860
I will repay your kindness...

216
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,530
for taking the rap for me.

217
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,580
How?

218
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,460
You could keep me company at night.

219
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,010
It seems like you don't
feel your injury at all!

220
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,170
Don't forget,

221
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,500
today,

222
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
it's my eldest brother's turn.

223
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,460
That's easy.

224
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,700
I hereby announce

225
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,810
to cancel all the shifts.

226
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,580
It's not like I'm a beast

227
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,220
that could eat you alive.

228
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,700
From now on,

229
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,100
don't put your life in danger again.

230
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,860
I know the world can be unfair at times.

231
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,700
There are difficulties in life.

232
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,980
But if you want to fight for men's rights,

233
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,010
the imperial token is not

234
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,340
the only solution to realize your goal.

235
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,050
You and I have a different status.

236
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,460
I have no choice.

237
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,340
You are my prince consort.

238
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,980
Your problem is our problem as well.

239
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
Your goal is our goal.

240
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,410
Our?

241
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,700
You were punished because of me.

242
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,890
Would you blame me?

243
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,650
I would spoil you nevertheless.

244
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,010
(Silly.)

245
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,460
(That's because you're my beloved Cheng Cheng.)

246
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
As for my suggestion earlier,

247
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,500
would you consider it?

248
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,530
What suggestion?

249
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,740
To keep me company at night.

250
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,650
Even the injury

251
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,700
can't stop your ill intention.

252
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,380
Your charm doesn't cease to mesmerize me.

253
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,860
(Is he giving up already?)

254
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,580
(I should play hard to get tonight)

255
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,500
(and make you come to me willingly.)

256
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,620
That hurts.

257
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,650
Where? Did I touch the wound?

258
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,930
Rest well.

259
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,290
If you can't fall asleep,

260
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,580
you can come to my room later.

261
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
(Qu Tan Er was very honorable today.)

262
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,810
(Has my gratitude for her)

263
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,100
(caused me to fall for her charm?)

264
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,770
Is he lost or something?

265
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,290
What is taking Mo Lian Cheng so long?

266
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,340
Jing Xin.

267
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,700
Yes, Your Highness.

268
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,580
It's getting late. You may go now.

269
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,580
It's not midnight yet.

270
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,050
Not to mention you're still carrying injuries.

271
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,620
I can't neglect my duties.

272
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,050
Just do as I said and go.

273
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,290
It's an order.

274
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,100
Yes.

275
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,290
With a bodyguard standing outside,

276
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,500
of course Cheng Cheng wouldn't come in.

277
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,460
Everything is set.

278
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,130
(She took the blame for me and got punished for it.)

279
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,130
(She suffered the injury.)

280
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,860
(But why is the pain in my heart.)

281
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,980
(Should I take this step forward?)

282
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,930
Why isn't that Mo Lian Cheng here yet?

283
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,460
Did I miscalculate?

284
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,740
Did it not work?

285
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,580
Cheng Cheng!

286
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,930

If he forgets, I'll help him remember.

299
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,620
His memories are just kept somewhere.

300
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,930
They are not gone forever.

Please have some soup.

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,930
Yan Chen is madly in love with her.

310
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,530
Everyone was impressed by her performance
on the test.

311
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,170
Who does she think she is?

312
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,260
Please calm down.

313
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,930
Qu Tan Er is not enjoying the spotlight.

314
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,810
What do you mean?

315
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,700
There was a message from Official Su.

316
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,340
After the test just now,

317
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,220
Qu Tan Er and Mo Lian Cheng
sneaked into Her Majesty's room

318
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,290
to steal a prescription.

319
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,050
She was caught at the scene and got punished
with lashes in front of everyone.

320
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,980
She was stealing a prescription?

321
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,620
Does her greed know no bounds?

322
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,890
But Yan Chen is still obsessed with her.

323
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,380
How foolish of him.

324
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,010
The nostalgia got the better of Young Master Mo.

325
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,340
He will see her true nature eventually.

326
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,500
During her training, Qu Tan Er
has been very competitive.

327
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,740
She won't give up on Yan Chen so easily.

328
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,770
Your Highness.

329
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,170
Young Master Mo will understand
your affection one day.

330
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,050
When Cheng Cheng first regained
part of his memories,

331
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,220
I think I pushed him.

332
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,580
He got upset.

333
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,580
Stay away from me. I'm in a bad mood.

334
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,460
But what caused it the second time?

335
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,860
Stop! Let her go!

336
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,680
(Misunderstanding)

337
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,500
Don't stare at us like that!

338
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,130
I know what you're thinking!

339
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,320
(Misunderstanding, Angry)

340
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,050
(At the great hall,)

341
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,620
(I told you my heart would belong to someone.)

342
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,380
Why didn't you get the meaning?

343
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,840
(Misunderstanding, Angry, Jealousy)

344
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:07,800
(Upset, Misunderstanding, Angry, Jealousy)

345
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,260
Could it be...

346
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,770
Cheng Cheng regains his memories
when he gets angry.

347
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,620
But it seems like

348
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,620
he gets angry quite often.

349
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,860
This should be easy.

350
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,260
There is nothing I can't achieve
when I put my back into it.

351
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,650
I feel pity for the prince consort.

352
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,100
Mo Lian Cheng.

353
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Why didn't you greet me this morning?

354
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,290
I'm not feeling very well today.

355
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,620
I apologize.

356
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,700
Don't forget next time!

357
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,380
Mo Lian Cheng!

358
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,340
Look at the way you walk.

359
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,740
It's not elegant at all.

360
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,170
You should learn from your brother.

361
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,290
I apologize.

362
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,170
I'll do my best to correct it.

363
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,930
How can he be so calm?

364
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,860
Young Master Mo.

365
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,170
Your snack is here.

366
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,410
What? What are you doing?

367
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,650
Sorry, Prince Consort.

368
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,980
As ordered by Her Highness,

369
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,220
you can't have the snack.

370
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,860
I still have some in my room.

371
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,290
Why am I the one who gets more upset every time?

372
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,620
Tan, do you think the plan is working?

373
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,410
I don't think it is.

374
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,620
Then there is only one method left.

375
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,890
I'll get a homewrecker.

376
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,650
Then he will panic for sure.

377
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,380
Jing Xin, bring Mo Yan Chen to me.

378
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,050
He's here.

379
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,770
Yan Chen.

380
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,050
Your Highness.

381
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,050
Make yourself at home. Sit.

382
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:03,770
Very well.

383
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,260
Jing Xin.

384
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,340
You're not needed here. You may leave now.

385
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,620
Yes.

386
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,260
Why has Your Highness only

387
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,340
invited me to dinner?

388
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,050
Xiyue gave this pork jerky as tribute.

389
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,500
I invited you to try them out.

390
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,220
It's only natural to share
the finer things with you.

391
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,650
Come on.

392
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,890
I'm overjoyed.

393
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,620
I shall make a toast to you first.

394
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,050
Very well. Cheers.

395
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,340
Here.

396
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,700
Try this.

397
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,700
It's all right. I can do it myself.

398
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,170
I can pick it up.

399
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,100
(I'm sorry, Yan Chen.)

400
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,530
(Would he be mad and come to me?)

401
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,170
Young Master.

402
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,530
What is it now?

403
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,650
The main prince consort and Her Highness
are enjoying dinner.

404
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,890
They are having a good time.

405
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,980
They treat each other like a special guest.

406
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,580
They are spoon-feeding each other.

407
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,410
I see.

408
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,650
Very well.

409
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,700
Tan Er.

410
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,930
Would you like me to play a song for you?

411
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,220
Sure.

412
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,170
Your Highness, it's an urgent matter.

413
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,370
An urgent matter?

414
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,300
An urgent matter...

415
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,260
But...

416
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,820
Since it's urgent, I should give you privacy.

417
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,260
I take my leave now.

418
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,850
We'll dine again another time.

419
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,890
Jing Xin, how was it?

420
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,170
I saw Yu Hao

421
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,300
walking back and forth outside the room.

422
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,610
Does Cheng Cheng know?

423
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,930
How did he react?

424
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,850
I was waiting for quite some time.

425
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,780
But I never heard

426
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,130
any sounds inside.

427
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,410
Nothing?

428
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,850
Why doesn't he care about me?

429
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,700
Why isn't he jealous or upset?

430
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,020
Do I mean nothing to him?

431
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,090
Tan.

432
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,850
Perhaps the prince consort
is restraining his urges.

433
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,890
Restraining his urges?

434
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,170
Fine.

435
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,060
If he won't come,

436
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,820
I'll go to him instead.

437
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,020
Let's go!

438
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,780
Yu Hao, go out with Jing Xin.

439
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,090
Your Highness is trying to break the rules again.

440
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,610
Do you not remember?

441
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,170
The Three Orders and Three Rules. I know.

442
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,020
But I still remember you as my Cheng Cheng.

443
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,500
I'll always be with you.

444
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,890
You merely lost your memories.

445
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,820
But I know what you're planning.

446
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,930
Please let me be with you, okay?

447
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,260
That won't be necessary.

448
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,300
If you become part of this,

449
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,130
I'm afraid...

450
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,980
I don't want Your Highness to become a drag on me.

451
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,130
You're just stubborn.

452
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,570
You're giving me the cold shoulder,

453
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,300
but you still keep my booklet.

454
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,930
Please don't make any assumptions.

455
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,570
It was Yu Hao.

456
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,930
He forgot to get rid of this.

457
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,130
Even I've said this,

458
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,780
you still won't change your mind?

459
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,780
I'm tired.

460
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,740
I need to rest.

461
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,560
♪I hear the gentle waves of the ocean♪

462
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,280
♪The blurry memories have become clear to me♪

463
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,610
Your Highness.

464
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,090
Your Highness, mind the stairs.

465
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,300
Curse that Mo Lian Cheng. Nothing works on him.

466
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,300
He's so unbearable when he lost his memories.

467
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,850
I miss Cheng Cheng.

468
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,570
Your Highness, don't be upset.

469
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,540
Perhaps the prince consort

470
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,980
has his reason to do so.

471
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,820
Yes. He just can't remember our past.

472
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,130
It's not that he doesn't love me.

473
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,280
♪Like the wind, I♪

474
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,840
♪I'm banished to the end of time♪

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,200
♪I can't hold onto the dream♪

476
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,930
(I'm in this time of turmoil I don't belong.)

477
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,460
(I have no choice.)

478
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,370
(I can't put Father and my family in danger.)

479
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,370
(I can't put Tan Er in harm's way)

480
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,410
(because of my plan.)

481
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,610
(Whether I lost my memories)

482
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,260
(or I become the lover in your memory,)

483
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,610
(nothing matters.)

484
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,500
(You should have)

485
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,090
(a peaceful life with my brother.)

486
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,170
(Forget me, Tan Er.)

487
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,890
(Even in this loneliness,)

488
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,300
(I shall have an ease of mind.)

489
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,300
Ever since the moment I arrived in Dongyue,

490
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,170
fate has been playing tricks on us.

491
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,700
I may not remember him the second time,

492
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,930
he could still find me and protect me.

493
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,460
And our son, Yu Er, too.

494
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,570
Yes. He lost his memories.

495
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,220
I can't blame a patient.

496
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,820
Your Highness.

497
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,570
I don't understand what you're saying.

498
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,740
Jing Xin.

499
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,700
Will you believe me?

500
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,090
Will you believe what I say?

501
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,700
I believe you.

502
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,460
I've been by your side since you were little.

503
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,300
You've been nice to me.

504
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,330
Whatever you do or say,

505
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,220
I will always believe you.

506
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,020
Whatever happens,

507
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,170
I will never leave your side.

508
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,220
How many times have I told you?

509
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,820
Call me Tan.

510
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,460
I'm glad to have you with me.

511
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,090
Otherwise, I would have given up already.

512
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,330
Tan.

513
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,060
Don't be upset.

514
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,370
When you feel sad,

515
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,300
I feel sad as well.

516
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,060
You have my word.

517
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,370
Whatever lifetime we live in,

518
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,330
I'll never leave your side.

519
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,090
I'll protect you.

520
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,060
Yes.

521
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,610
I'm a princess!

522
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,820
I can't be defeated so easily.

523
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,820
Besides,

524
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,090
I have you with me.

525
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,650
Go for it.

526
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,060
