00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,700
You can ask the servants to do this in the future.

17
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,170
Come forth.
Send the prince consort back to the residence.

18
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,140
You.

19
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,730
General Lu came to train you personally.

20
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,890
Second Princess, please follow
what the master says.

21
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,300
Take the training seriously.

22
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,330
Cheng Cheng, save me.

23
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,370
Hold it tightly.

24
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,580
Her Highness is not good with physicality.

25
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,500
Official Xiao, please start the training easy and
gradually increase the difficulty.

26
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,730
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng, don't leave.

27
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,610
What are you waiting for?

28
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,530
Keep training.

29
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,500
Speed up.

30
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,420
Why did the empress ask me to come?

31
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,700
Her Majesty knows Your Highness has been
training hard recently,

32
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,970
and wants to grant you this tonic.

33
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,090
Bring it over.

34
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,220
What is this black thing?

35
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,620
There is no bitter smell of herbs,

36
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,370
but the delicious fragrance of meat broth.

37
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,740
Is this some kind of game?

38
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,810
I feel too guilty to receive Her Majesty's favour.

39
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,300
If Your Highness is receiving such a favour,

40
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,370
you should not let Her Majesty down.

41
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,090
Her Majesty also asked me to tell you

42
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,580
that Your Highness should train your body well
and master both civil and military skills.

43
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,020
If you don't pass the military training,

44
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,770
there will be huge punishment.

45
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,210
I understand.

46
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,020
Your Highness should head back now.

47
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,140
Tan Er, you've worked hard.

48
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,580
The herbs in the tea will help you get pregnant.

49
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,340
I see why

50
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,140
you suddenly started to care about me.

51
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,810
You want me to get pregnant.

52
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,970
Tan Er, I'm doing this for you.

53
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:52,930
If you have any illness that

54
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,650
you don't want others to know,

55
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,370
you can tell me.

56
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,700
Nonsense.

57
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,740
Did someone spread that rumour

58
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,300
or did you think of it randomly?

59
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,250
My son can walk already.

60
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,900
Can't believe I'm being questioned on this.

61
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,050
Tan Er, I'm not thinking too much.

62
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,340
Look, you've been married for a while.

63
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,700
You even married two consorts.

64
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,090
But your tummy

65
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,050
isn't making any progress.

66
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,420
How can I not get worried?

67
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,140
In the narrower sense, it matters to our Qu Family.

68
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,250
In a broader sense,

69
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,370
I worried about the future of Dongyue.

70
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,740
Of course I'd be anxious, right?

71
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,250
Could it be that the Mo Family's two sons...

72
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,420
Stop thinking too much.

73
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,770
I'm not pregnant because I don't want to be.

74
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,650
Nothing is wrong with the three of us.

75
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,490
How can you not want a baby?

76
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,180
You can have as many babies as you want.

77
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,740
I can take care of them for you.

78
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,340
It's not as easy as you're making it.

79
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,460
Having a baby is not just my own business.

80
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,420
So that's why

81
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,140
you should respect each other, love each other,
and work together.

82
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,970
I know

83
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,770
you and the main prince consort
have a strong relationship.

84
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,970
I'm not worried about that.

85
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,930
However, you should also take care
of the secondary prince consort.

86
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,900
You shouldn't ignore either of them.

87
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,770
Ignore him?

88
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,810
I'm being proactive...

89
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,050
Okay.

90
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,090
I'll listen to you.

91
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,090
I'll take good care of the secondary prince consort.

92
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,620
Okay, daughter.

93
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,340
It's all up to you.

94
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,420
They both belong to you.

95
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,740
I wouldn't have had to wait until now

96
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,970
if Mo Lian Cheng

97
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,620
had just agreed.

98
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:32,970
Look.

99
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,250
All these herbs are good for your sex life.

100
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,370
Remember,

101
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,860
you have to take them with both prince consorts.

102
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,740
Also,

103
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,970
you shouldn't have a preference when you choose
who to serve you at night.

104
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,580
Only treating them equally

105
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,860
can make the family harmonious.

106
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,740
I am the princess of Dongyue.

107
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,300
I get whoever I want.

108
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,810
Tan Er, don't blame my nagging.

109
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,530
If you can provide offspring for the Qu Family,

110
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,140
you'd accomplish something great for the Empress.

111
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,250
Only when you have a bright future

112
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,650
can I enjoy my old age.

113
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,530
Taking turns serving you?

114
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,970
Sounds good.

115
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,420
Lian Cheng and I will take good care of
Your Highness.

116
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,300
This strategy will not only

117
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,900
build a stronger relationship between us,

118
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,740
but can also serve as an example for the nobility,

119
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,810
so that the elders and the empress can rest assured.

120
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,650
I came up with this idea

121
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,810
after thinking things through.

122
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,980
Does she want to break the agreement

123
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,810
and use the power of all sides to force me?

124
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,050
Your Highness is taking the big picture
into consideration.

125
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,900
I'll do my best to cooperate.

126
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,980
Very good.

127
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,170
Lian Cheng, what about you?

128
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,170
I've never forgotten about the intentions of
our marriage.

129
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,660
If this can help strengthen our relationship,

130
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,780
I'll do my best to support it.

131
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,610
If it breaks our agreement

132
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,290
and promises,

133
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,170
I will not tolerate it.

134
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,170
How dare he threaten me?

135
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,020
How dare he be so confident as a concubine?

136
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,050
Eighth Brother, you're overthinking it.

137
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,370
Her Highness keeps a good balance between us.

138
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,610
We serve her well.

139
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,370
How come there will be unfortunate incidents?

140
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,700
Here.

141
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,250
Tan Er, have some shrimp.

142
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,020
Eldest Brother, have some shrimp.

143
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
Are we done eating?

144
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,290
Your Highness.

145
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,170
If we are done,

146
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,610
we should rest.

147
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,780
Eldest Brother, you should do it.

148
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,460
This can't be right.

149
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,220
Elders should come first.

150
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,410
His Highness is more important.

151
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,370
Eldest Brother.

152
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,660
You shouldn't decline out of modesty.

153
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,460
We are brothers, there's no need to be so indecisive.

154
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,370
Take it.

155
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,850
Since I have leverage on her,

156
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,700
I reckon she won't force me to do anything.

157
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,900
I'll see what happens and react accordingly.

158
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,490
I'll take it.

159
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,050
Well.

160
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,900
Am I yielding to her?

161
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,140
Eighth Brother.

162
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,340
Eighth Brother.

163
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,050
Eldest Brother.

164
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,580
It's natural to feel nervous before your first time.

165
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,460
I'm here to have a few drinks with you.

166
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,460
Maybe Eldest Brother just wants to relieve
his sorrow through alcohol.

167
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,020
I'm unsure why Tan Er hasn't asked us
to consummate our marriages,

168
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,290
but we shouldn't think too much.

169
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,020
Although the final step of our wedding
has been late,

170
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,020
it has finally come.

171
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,290
Eldest Brother, you and Tan Er grew up together.

172
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,930
You two have a solid relationship.

173
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,170
Why don't you just

174
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,980
ask the question you want to ask?

175
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,170
Tan Er must have her own considerations.

176
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,170
I shouldn't burden her further.

177
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,610
If a man always yields,

178
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,810
concedes, and tolerates everything

179
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,410
in a marriage,

180
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,220
then how is that different from a prison?

181
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,290
How can there be happiness?

182
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,290
Everyone is selfish.

183
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,610
If you want relationships to last and the family
to be harmonious,

184
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,460
you should think of others.

185
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,810
If you only think about your own gains and losses,

186
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,220
that'd be the reason for letting happiness
pass you by.

187
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,340
Here. Cheers.

188
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,930
What Eldest Brother said makes sense.

189
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,490
Maybe I am blindsided by my will to resist

190
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,980
and have become the most selfish person?

191
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,020
Cheers.

192
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,050
Tan.

193
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,980
You've been getting ready

194
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,020
ever since you came back.

195
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,540
You're just consummating your marriage,

196
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,370
there's no need to over-prepare.

197
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,660
It's going to be a great time.
Of course I need to prepare myself.

198
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,780
Men dress up for those who love them.

199
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,700
Women don't need to do the same.

200
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,250
Pleasing who you love

201
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,580
is not burdensome, it makes me happy.

202
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,930
You always say things I don't understand.

203
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,340
Then you should think about it yourself.

204
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,850
I'm going to find Cheng Cheng and
spend a great night with him.

205
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,460
Bye.

206
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,220
It smells so nice.

207
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,020
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng.

208
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,930
Cheng Cheng.

209
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,370
Cheng Cheng.

210
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,540
Your Highness.

211
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,540
You drank?

212
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,700
What did you drink?

213
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Did you leave some for me?

214
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,730
No.

215
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,610
There isn't any for you.

216
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,290
Then, do you have a place in your heart for me?

she behaves with respect.

Am I really

251
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,340
the Cheng Cheng you miss so much?

252
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,890
Senior Liu.

253
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,650
Liu Bai Shui.

254
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Liu Bai Shui.

255
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,100
Your Highness.

256
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,260
Why didn't you give me a heads-up that
you were coming?

257
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,620
We know each other well. No need for formalities.

258
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,050
We've only met twice.

259
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,170
Are we that close?

260
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:58,890
Jing Xin.

261
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,050
Her Highness

262
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,410
was afraid that you don't have

263
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,220
good food to eat in the forest and

264
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,930
asked me to bring some snacks and

265
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,460
two chickens.

266
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,530
It must be a great deal of effort for you

267
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,340
to bring so many things to me.

268
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,010
You should just bring some sliver

269
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,700
when you come the next time.

270
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,010
This is not a big deal.

271
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,170
Her Highness knows

272
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,050
that

273
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,260
I'm very strong.

274
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
Why did you hit me?

275
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,700
Senior.

276
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,650
How's your progress?

277
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,890
What progress?

278
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,930
The pills to heal amnesia.

279
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,860
The pills

280
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,770
are complete.

281
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,220
Really?

282
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,170
What you just said makes me feel kind of bad.

283
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,980
Why don't you trust me?

284
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,100
That's great! That's great!

285
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,410
Thanks so much, Senior.

286
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,260
Bring it out for me.

287
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,220
Okay, okay, okay.

288
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,650
Okay, okay.

289
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,290
She truly thinks I'm an expert herbalist.

290
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,130
Fortunately, I have some stock.

291
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,100
I knew you would come today,

292
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,460
so I got everything ready and waited for you.

293
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Look.

294
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,460
Senior.

295
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,050
This medicine smells a little too strong.

296
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,010
I'm afraid that even this is not strong enough.

297
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,050
If you take a regular dosage

298
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,860
but nothing happens,

299
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,530
you can take more accordingly.

300
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,810
Accordingly?

301
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,700
How much should I add?

302
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,980
You shouldn't exceed three pills in a day.

303
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,290
I mean, no one will die after taking less than three.

304
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,770
Thank you, Senior. Let's go.

305
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,340
Your Highness.

306
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,500
Please wait.

307
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,220
What?

308
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,930
Do you have anything else to say?

309
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,930
No, I mean...

310
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,650
The slivers...

311
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,130
Don't mention it, don't even mention it.

312
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,740
Senior, it'll hurt our relationship

313
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,170
if you keep mentioning money.

314
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,130
Just keep the rest.

315
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,650
No.

316
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,100
Don't mention it.

317
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,100
You can keep the rest.

318
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,050
No, Your Highness, Your Highness.

319
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,050
Don't mention it.

320
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,050
Your Highness, slow down.

321
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,740
How many times have I said it?

322
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,890
Why don't you understand?

323
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,260
I wanted to say that you didn't

324
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,130
leave enough silvers.

325
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,380
Tan, in order to heal the consort,

326
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,700
you even forgot

327
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,620
that women should stay away from the kitchen.

328
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,740
Mo Lian Cheng likes to overthink.

329
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,700
If we ask him to take the medicine,

330
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,050
he will ask a lot of questions

331
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,700
and refuse to take it.

332
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,580
This will do.

333
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,770
He won't notice even if

334
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,460
he has a pair of eagle eyes.

335
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,860
Tan, you're smart indeed.

336
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,500
But you could've asked

337
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,100
chefs from the kitchen

338
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
to do this kind of thing.

339
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,890
Why do you need to do it yourself?

340
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,100
Food made with love

341
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,220
tastes different.

342
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,700
Food made with love?

343
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,500
What does that taste like?

344
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,100
Jing Xin.

345
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,290
These are only for Mo Lian Cheng,

346
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,700
be sure to cook these separately.

347
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,810
Don't worry.

348
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,340
Leave it to me.

349
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,050
Okay.

350
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,700
Taste of love.

351
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,170
I can't smell anything.

352
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,100
Today, I asked the kitchen to prepare

353
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,740
some Jiangnan glutinous rice balls

354
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,460
for you prince consorts to taste.

355
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,290
The round shape of the rice balls

356
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,930
must mean reunion and harmony.

357
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,380
That's right. Have a taste.

358
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,340
Where are the rice balls for Eighth Brother?

359
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,050
I asked them to cook

360
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,010
the rice balls in separate pots.

361
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,500
Yan Chen, you are the main prince consort.

362
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,340
You should taste them first.

363
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,290
I'll wait for Eighth Brother's and

364
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,380
let's taste them together.

365
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,290
That also works.

366
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,010
Now, can you have some?

367
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,410
What?

368
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,340
Lian Cheng, so you don't like

369
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,930
the food I prepared for you?

370
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,500
The rice balls just came off of the stove,

371
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,860
I don't like food that's too hot.

372
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,930
You should eat first.

373
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,860
Here.

374
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,130
I like hot food.

375
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,930
Eighth Brother, you can have mine.

376
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,740
Eighth Brother, let's taste them together.

377
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,740
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

378
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,620
Yan Chen.

379
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,620
It's fine.

380
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,810
The stuffing tastes like

381
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,580
hair-removal medicine.

382
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,380
Maybe hair removal is also popular among
Jiangnan men?

383
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,810
Hair-removal medicine?

384
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,170
This is the normal black sesame stuffing.

385
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,220
What is wrong with the kitchen?

386
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,770
I must go to ask them.

387
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,460
My mistake embarrassed you.

388
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,380
However,

389
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,740
you are a married man.

390
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,410
You should take hair-removal medicine regularly.

391
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,810
How can you make your wife do it for you?

392
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,260
Eat.

393
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,220
It's filled with Tan Er's good will.

394
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,130
Eat.

395
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,620
Your Eighth Brother is too hairy.

396
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,930
Her Highness has been unsatisfied
for quite a while.

397
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:12,860
Really?

398
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,100
To me,

399
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,500
the second princess has been saving
the secondary prince consort's face.

400
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,260
She has never mentioned it in front of him.

401
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,260
What am I doing?

402
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,860
Oh my god. He's removing his hair.

403
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,580
How could I make him do this?

404
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,340
You're still up?

405
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,530
I'm going to bed soon.

406
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,740
I came to explain.

407
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,770
I actually got the medicine from

408
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,770
an expert herbalist.

409
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,130
I thought the medicine can bring back your memory.

410
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,650
Who knew it...

411
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,860
You don't need to explain.

412
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,580
Don't get me wrong.

413
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,460
I like hairy men who

414
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,130
are full of testosterone.

415
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,860
I don't care about what you like.

416
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,890
I just

417
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,860
don't want others to talk behind my back.

418
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,580
The gossipy servants.

419
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,410
I'll be sure to punish them

420
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,010
for your sake.

421
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,810
Your Highness, please don't cause
any more trouble.

422
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,050
I'll stay the night

423
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,500
to shut the mouths of the gossipy crowd.

424
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,460
How could I allow her to stay?

425
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,580
To restore my reputation, I can bear this.

426
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,580
If Mo Lian Cheng allowed me to stay,

427
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,930
maybe he's agreeing to serve me?

428
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500
If she wants to consummate our marriage,

429
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,260
things will become more complicated

430
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,700
if I keep refusing her.

431
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,650
Anyway.

432
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,010
He's mad at me right now.

433
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,100
If I do something to him,

434
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,220
he'll throw me out of his room.

435
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,770
Is it possible that she doesn't want to touch me

436
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,380
because I'm hairy?

The hair-removal medicine

451
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,930
does work.

452
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,650
Really?

453
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,530
You know what, last night, Her Highness...

454
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,530
You don't know?

455
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,530
I don't.

456
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,530
Tell me, what happened?

457
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:45,930
You see...

458
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,530
What?

459
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,220
Do you want to know?

460
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,980
What are you guys talking about?

461
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,810
Oh my god. You scared me.

462
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,810
Sit down, sit down.

463
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,500
Keep going, keep going.

464
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:56,770
Tell me, tell me.

465
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,980
Don't tell anyone else.

466
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,810
Okay, okay.

467
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,100
Her Highness stayed at

468
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,650
the Snow Court last night.

469
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,340
I see how important
the hair-removal medicine is for men.

470
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,410
Do you know where

471
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,260
the second princess stayed last night?

472
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,570
Everyone in the residence knows.

473
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,650
Otherwise, the hair-removal medicine
would've been a waste.

474
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,740
Everyone knows?

475
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,130
Of course, you can ask them.

476
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,820
You can't discuss Her Highness behind her back.

477
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,570
Your behaviour has become poorer.

478
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,740
Eldest Brother, my mistake.

479
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,260
My mistake. Never again.

480
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,890
Are you missing the days

481
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,060
during which you taught me how to play zither?

482
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,330
You are so mean.

483
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,220
Why are you acting all cool

484
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,410
after you've fallen in love with me?

485
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,220
Nonsense.

486
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
I'm telling the truth.

487
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,980
You kissed me when I stayed over last night,

488
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
right?

489
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,130
You were dreaming.

490
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,090
I wasn't dreaming.

491
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,930
You said no matter where, no matter when,

492
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,260
and no matter who we became,

493
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,610
you'll always find me, love me,

494
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,890
and marry me a thousand times.

495
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,020
Lifetime after lifetime, we will never be apart.

496
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,610
You.

497
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,650
You will belong to me eventually.

498
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,060
Lian Cheng.

499
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,820
Eldest Brother.

500
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,780
Here. I have a bowl of tonic for you.

501
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,540
It has all sorts of great ingredients.

502
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,610
Try it.

503
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,570
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

504
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,500
But, I'm not sick.

505
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,570
It'd be a waste for me to have it.

506
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,460
You must be tired from last night.

507
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,700
You should have some.

508
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,300
Last night.

509
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,330
Nothing happened last night.

510
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,500
But I won't turn down

511
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,460
Eldest Brother's good will.

512
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,020
Here.

513
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,780
On the wedding day, he was happy about it,

514
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,930
but he's a little disappointed today.

515
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,410
Eldest Brother.

516
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,220
It's okay, I'll get it.

517
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,500
Be careful.

518
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,130
I'm so tired.

519
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,170
General Lu is crueler than my personal trainer.

520
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,610
She intends to embarrass me.

521
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,610
Tan.

522
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:17,820
What?

523
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,500
Today, it's the prince consort's turn to serve you.

524
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,370
Why did you come back to your own room?

525
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,930
I forgot about it.

526
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,460
The prince consort has been waiting for you

527
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,220
in his room for two hours.

528
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,540
But I'm not in the mood right now.

529
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,980
You were the one who decided to take turns with
the prince consorts.

530
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,890
If you don't obey the rule you made by yourself,

531
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,980
it will hurt your reputation.

532
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,890
Waiting like this must be hard on him.

533
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,570
Wait.

534
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,740
You're going like this?

535
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,130
Don't you want to take a shower and dress up?

536
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,850
No need. I'm going.

537
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,980
No perfume powder today?

538
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,370
So you've left

539
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,260
your first time to me.

540
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,060
Are you sleepy?

541
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,170
