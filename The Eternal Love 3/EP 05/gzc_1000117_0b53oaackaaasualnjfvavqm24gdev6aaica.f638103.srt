What's up?

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,160
Starting to have an attitude to the wife
after becoming a concubine?

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
In the main hall,

19
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,160
I said that you'll only be able to follow through

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
if you follow your heart.

21
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,550
Why do you not understand me?

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,880
You're always putting on different acts.

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,830
How would I know if you're being serious?

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Do you think I'd joke around with
my true feelings?

25
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,720
I told you, no matter when

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,470
and who we have become,

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,800
I'll find you

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,190
and fall in love with you.

29
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,520
I'll marry you a thousand times.

30
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,110
We'll never be apart.

31
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,270

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,670
I'm like this again.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,830
Will you blame me again for

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,670
disobeying the Three Orders and Three Rules?

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,750
You did this while aware of the rules.

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,030
You won't believe me if I say you were the one
who initiated this.

42
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,270
Well,

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm not going to waste my energy on crazy people.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Wait.

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,080
In the main hall,

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,440
did Her Majesty approve our plans?

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
Yes.

48
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,910
You'll be my concubine.

49
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,550
Mo Yan Chen will be my wife.

50
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,960
I can't tell if it's a good thing

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,190
that I've fulfilled my wish while not having
my memories.

52
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,190
Eighth Brother,

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
how can you blame it on Tan Er
when the Empress granted the marriage?

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,190
Tan Er,

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,830
I know it's not the best decision for you,

56
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,360
but please don't blame it on Lian Cheng.

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
He has his reasons.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,160
I thought he was going to blame me
for marrying Mo Lian Cheng.

59
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,600
Why is he comforting me?

60
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
I'll take him home.

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,470
For what he did to you,

62
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,360
I'll make it up to you on his behalf.

63
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,080
Let's go.

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,470
You must do something to make it up to me.

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,550
Screw him.

66
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,320
They can finally get married.

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm jealous.

68
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,480
It'll be your turn very soon.

69
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,040
Greetings, Father.

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
Congratulations, brothers.

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,510
The imperial order has arrived.

72
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,350
Second Princess has thought it through.

73
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,550
Only this way, Eighth Brother and I

74
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,200
can be lucky enough to serve the same wife.

75
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,790
Since your wish has been fulfilled,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,640
do not let Her Highness down.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,510
I understand.

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,720
I won't let Father down.

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,440
Eighth Brother,

80
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,230
it's normal to not be together with your loved one.

81
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,760
The past is the past.

82
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,040
It's better to face it

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,670
than to dwindle in sadness.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,440
Eldest Brother,

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,350
there's nothing going on between
Second Princess and me.

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
I will not be a threat to you.

87
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,760
I understand, there's nothing to explain.

88
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,390
You love Her Highness so much,

89
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,160
but she seems to be a free spirit.

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,200
It would probably…

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,790
Eighth Brother,

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,200
it's not a husband's place to discuss his wife.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,790
I understand the personality of Her Highness.

94
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
I know all about

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,230
the powerlessness of Her Highness
throughout this whole thing.

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,640
You don't have to say anything more.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,390
But...

98
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,440
There are no buts.

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,920
Both of us will be serving the same wife,

100
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
we'll need to support each other,

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,950
as not to leave any opportunities
for others to gossip.

102
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,160
The marriage has been set and
the virginity inspection is coming up.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,390
Eighth Brother, are you worried?

104
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,000
The virginity inspection?

105
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,640
Eldest Brother, are you worried?

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,830
Me?

107
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,440
I certainly am not worried.

108
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,320
However,

109
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,350
didn't the Empress order you to the palace
late at night?

110
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,600
But nothing was done, right?

111
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,920
It's not a minor thing.

112
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,510
Are you still... or not?

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
No need to ask more about it.

114
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,550
Eighth Brother,

115
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,790
even though the Empress is the one
granting the marriage.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,110
If you go back on your word,

117
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,320
I'll find a way to make

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,200
Second Princess only marry Eldest Brother.

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,000
I haven't settled on an answer,

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,270
but you seem to have an answer.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,040
I just want to remind you that

122
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,320
if you know something's going to happen for sure,

123
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,440
it'd be better to plan ahead.

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,760
Are you worrying about me

125
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,550
or our family's reputation?

126
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,320
If you've made up your mind,

127
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,040
be ready to face the consequences.

128
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,320
Feng Yang.

129
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm a princess of a kingdom.

130
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,670
It still takes so much to get married.

131
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,720
It's almost like the Single's Day sale.
[*Single's Day is a shopping holiday in China]

132
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,350
You put in the deposits in a split second

133
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,200
but spend the rest of your life paying the bills.

134
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,110
I'm doing so much.

135
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,110
These men aren't doing anything.

136
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,880
That's not fair.

137
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,320
They can't just do you like this.

138
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,040
They have to go through the virginity inspection.

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,950
Virginity inspection?

140
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,440
To check whether they're still virgins.

141
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,480
Men can be inspected as well?

142
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,760
I heard that

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,640
it's a skill that has been passed down
for generations.

144
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,720
No one knows exactly how except
for those virginity inspectors.

145
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,830
These secret skills

146
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,830
are usually fake.

147
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,350
I can't say for sure about other things,

148
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,950
but the virginity inspection
is definitely precise.

149
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,510
There was once a nobleman

150
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,000
who was selected by the Empress
to join the harem.

151
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,600
He was punished by law

152
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,320
because he didn't pass the inspection.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,950
How was he punished?

154
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,830
He's no longer with us.

155
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,390
Oh no.

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,830
Cheng Cheng's body should

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,320
belong to the Eighth Young Master of this world.

158
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,670
If something had really happened between him
and the Empress,

159
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
wouldn't he be in big trouble?

160
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,510
That doesn't make sense.

161
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,710
If so,

162
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,150
why was the Empress so sure about
granting this marriage?

163
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,230
Unless…

164
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,440
Jing Xin,

165
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,030
hand this to Mo Lian Cheng.

166
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,880
Keep it a secret.

167
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,590
Go.

168
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,280
On it.

169
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,000
I've never asked for anything in this life

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,150
besides money.

171
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,880
Please keep Cheng Cheng safe.

172
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
(Don't worry,)

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,840
(Jing Xin and I will be right outside during
tomorrow's virginity inspection.)

174
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,440
(We'll rescue you)

175
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,910
(if anything starts to go wrong.)

176
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,440
(You'll always be my Cheng Cheng)

177
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
(regardless of your virginity status.)

178
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,470
She might be a player,

179
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,710
but she is indeed responsible.

180
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,760
(I've heard someone say that)

181
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,590
(the most important moments of your life)

182
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,550
(will stick)

183
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,960
(even if you have forgotten about everything.)

184
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,910
(It's just like that Sakura tree.)

185
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,550
(The fragrance and the petals are always there.)

186
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,550
(No matter how many lives have passed,)

187
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,840
(we'll always meet again under the Sakura tree.)

188
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,790
(Cheng Cheng, no matter if you know about it)

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,790
(or not,)

190
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,110
(you'll be able to remember the times)

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,400
(that we were with each other once again.)

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,790
(Because those memories)

193
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,790
(can defy the flowing time.)

194
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,200
Why do her words

195
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,790
make my heartache?

196
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,520
The fragrance of Sakura

197
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,350
resides deep

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,550
in my heart.

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
Could it be...?

200
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,380
(Tan Er)

201
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,620
(If you see this letter when you return, please
wait for me to find you. Please. Tan Er)

202
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,110
Tan Er.

203
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:12,300
(Virginity Inspection Bureau)

204
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,520
Jing Xin.

205
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,760
Are you sure about waiting over here?

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,910
Yes.

207
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,640
Why don't we see anyone?

208
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,790
I need to go and check.

209
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,590
I was worried that something
would happen to you.

210
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,280
Your handwriting is still terrible.

211
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,400
What?

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
We've been together for such a long time.

213
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,280
Asshole.

214
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,520
Why didn't you tell me that you're back?

215
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,880
It's fun tricking me, right?

216
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,110
Your Highness.

217
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,640
Open the door, Your Highness.

218
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,710
If you keep it closed for longer,

219
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,760
rumors against the Eighth Brother may spread.

220
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,590
Whatever the rumors may be,
I'll handle them for him.

221
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,150
If Your Highness doesn't open the door,

222
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,030
I'll have to open it myself.

223
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,550
Since Your Highness didn't find anything,

224
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,030
I'll be taking Eighth Brother back home.

225
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,030
No one can leave without my permission.

226
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,670
Your Highness should know,

227
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,790
if there is no reason to decline the marriage,

228
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,000
you shouldn't be seeing the groom
before the wedding.

229
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,550
Otherwise, you'd make a huge mistake

230
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,230
and must plead guilty to the Empress.

231
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,350
Even if you can handle it,

232
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,150
the Mo Family can't.

233
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,780
(Mo Residence)

234
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,960
I'll have to find a way to get out of here.

235
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,440
If I can't see Tan Er before losing my memory
again,

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,640
I don't know when we'll meet again.

237
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,790
Father, I've been waiting for so long.

238
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,760
I'm finally able to be with you face-to-face.

239
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,550
Father, how have you been?

240
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,280
If you truly care about my well-being,

241
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,670
then you shouldn't be causing any trouble
before the wedding.

242
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,840
Feng Yang told me about what happened
at the Virginity Inspection Bureau.

243
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,590
I apologize for not being caring.

244
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,230
The plan has yet to be carried out,

245
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,790
how could you speak as if you were a prince?

246
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
My mistake.

247
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,440
Father, have you thought that

248
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,110
seeking power too eagerly

249
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,910
will cause you to be eaten alive by the power?

250
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,030
Such a stupid opinion.

251
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,840
Only those who aren't at the top

252
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,350
will be harmed by these.

253
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,520
What you should really be concerned about

254
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,110
is how to win the Second Princess's heart.

255
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,910
Are you getting married just

256
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
to waste your virginity?

257
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,960
Stay here

258
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,030
and think thoroughly about your mistakes.

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,670
Come.

260
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,910
My Lord.

261
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,710
Lock the door.

262
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,320
Yes, My Lord.

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,710
Father is still trapped by his ambition

264
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Even in another universe.

265
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,350
Tragedy may occur again

266
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,470
if I don't

267
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,230
stop him.

268
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,140
(Mo Residence)

269
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,470
I'll have to go find Tan Er.

270
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
How can I do that

271
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,280
without being noticed?

272
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,670
It's pretty exciting

273
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,760
to secretly visit a guy's room

274
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,280
late at night.

275
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,910

Tan Er.

277
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,550
You've evolved.

278
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,000
You stayed for a much longer time this time.

279
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,320
You're even better.

280
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,840
You know how to pick locks.

281
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,960
Young Master,

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,030
you look so gorgeous and tasty.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,030
How dare you.

284
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,160
Refusing me?

285
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,040
Are you trying to flirt with me?

286
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,710
What you took from me at
the Virginity Inspection Bureau

287
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,400
should be returned to me now.

288
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,470
Return what?

289
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,560
You are mine.

290
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,280

298
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,070
Did she play some voodoo trick?

299
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,520
It was just a kiss.

We already have a child.

301
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,680
Kissing is nothing.

302
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,680
A child?

303
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,950
You don't believe me?

304
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,640
Isn't there a mole on your left inner thigh?

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,230
You!

306
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,350
You must have paid
the Virginity Inspection Bureau

307
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
to spy on me.

308

You can't do anything you want even if
you're a princess.

309

You...

310
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,040
You...

311
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,920
So it's all my fault now?

312
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,430
What a slacker.

313
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,520
Don't switch.

314
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,110
Confront me just with this face.

315
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,920
How dare you change?

316
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,590
How dare you?

317
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,350
I'm beating you up.

318
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,640
Tan,

319
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,800
you're mad at the Eighth Young Master again?

320
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,350
If I don't let my anger out,

321
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,520
I'll have a serious breakdown.

322
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,110
Since you love face-changing so much,

323
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,310
how about I call you 72 metamorphoses?

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,880
You never know what a man thinks.

326
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,830
Can't deny that.

327
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,590
Oh right, the Secretariat
wants to ask Your Highness

328
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,190
about Prince Consort's living arrangements.

Snow Court?

331
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,520
Snow Court is the backyard.

are superior.

335
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,470
But I only got to

336

assist my customers in designing theirs.

337
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,560
It's finally my turn

338
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,400
to show people my skills.

339
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,070
Jing Xin, bring me some pen and paper.

340
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,830
Alright.

341
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,800

Zhuo, Qi,

346
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,800
you're doing it wrong.

347
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,160
The longer ones should face that way.

348
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,070
Yes, Your Highness.

349
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,110
The fabric is also wrong, Jing Xin.

350
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,920
It should be softer than this.

351
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,680
We've already changed it five to six times.

352
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,640
You're describing it in such detail that

353
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
it almost sounds like you've seen it before.

354
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,880
So smart.

355
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,800

We're making it according to your design.

358

But if you keep doing this,

359
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,430
aren't you worried about getting into trouble?

360
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,830
I don't mind getting into trouble

361
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,000

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,580
♪Still keeping this face in mind for
a thousand years♪

368
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
(Jing Xin's cutie)(I want a kiss)

369
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,430
I don't know if Cheng Cheng will ever be okay.

370
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,230
If I knew better,

371
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,000
I wouldn't have fought with him in Dongyue.

372
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,640
I didn't know he put in such effort
to win me back again.

373
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,420
♪From breaking down the barriers
to falling helplessly in love♪

374
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:56,060
♪We share a night of happiness,
till deaths do us part♪

375
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,430
What?

376
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,040
I heard that Princess named your place

377
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,640
the Snow Court.

378
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,880
Think about it.

379
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,830
This means she's playing it cool with you.

380
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,880
Snow Court.

381
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,110
She could've given it any other name.

382
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,680
Why Snow Court?

383
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,400
It sounds so sad.

384
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,880
It's like you're thrown into the cold palace.

385
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,260
(Snow Court)

386
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,070
Why does the name sound so familiar?

387
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,040
Why is my heart aching?

388
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,040
Young Master, your crown and formal robe

389
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,400
should be much better than those
of Eighth Young Master.

390
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,880
But look at this…

391
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,110
You are losing boundaries.

392
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,350
Eighth Brother and I are serving the same wife.

393
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,520
Competing with one another is taboo.

394
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,000
You should be even more careful

395
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,800
after you follow me into Second Princess's
residence.

396
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,520
Don't cause any trouble.

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
Yes.

398
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,710
You and Her Highness are deeply in love.

399
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,230
Her Highness will like it

400
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,160
no matter how the robe looks.

401
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,430
There's no freedom of marriage

402
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,520
for those of the royal family.

403
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,950
Since I'm marrying the one I love,

404
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,040
I have no other wishes.

405
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Eldest Princess is here.

406
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

407
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,070
I've already told you,

408
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,880
you don't have to be this formal with me.

409
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
Your Highness is Tan Er's eldest sister.

410
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,400
After the wedding,

411
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,110
Your Highness will be my eldest sister as well.

412
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,310
I must be respectful.

413
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,350
Mi Xue.

414
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,470
Your Highness.

415
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,760
Leave us.

416
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Threads made of gold and silver.

417
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,590
Hundreds of embroidery workers spent three years

418
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,110
to finish this one piece.

419
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,520
That one is too average. It doesn't fit you.

420
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,470
Tan Er knows my taste.

421
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,000
I quite like the wedding robe she gave me.

422
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,280
You have big ambitions.

423
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,110
Why do you suffer in silence?

424
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,310
You avoided me as much as possible.

425
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,160
But compared to Qu Tan Er,

426
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,190
I know you better.

427
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,040
But I have already found my happiness.

428
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,190
This robe

429
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,310
will find a better owner.

430
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,950
This robe belongs to you.

431
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,110
You'll take it one day even if
you don't take it today.

432
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,160
You'll wear it one day even if
you don't wear it today.

433
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,310
Your Highness,

434
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,400
you can pick any man you want in this world.

435
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,350
Why are you spending so much effort on me?

436
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,310
There are thousands of phoenix trees
in this world,

437
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,190
but I only long for one.

438
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,190
Yan Chen,

439
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,920
do you remember the time at Jingyi Pavilion?

440
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,560
Eldest Brother,

441
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,190
you aren't in charge today, but why are you...

442
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,520
Second Princess finished her articles
very quickly.

443
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,280
She just left.

444
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,640
You're late.

445
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Fourteenth Young Master.

446
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,470
Coming.

447
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,230
Eldest Brother, I'm leaving.

448
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,000
Jing Xuan.

449
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,740

451
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,280
Pearl and jade piece together as one.

452
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

453
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,680
I overstepped.
