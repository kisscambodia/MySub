Enter.

17
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,750
Greetings, Eldest Princess.

18
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,830
Girls from all over the place

19
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,110
are trying to imitate Your Highness's style.

20
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,030
To be like you, they'd...

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,440
Peasant girls?

22
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
The girls born into noble families

23
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,390
have all drawn their eyebrows in
your Floating Cloud eyebrow style.

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,240
The crimson yarn robes you particularly adore
are in extremely high demand.

25
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,440
From now on, draw my eyebrows
in the Sparrow Soaring style,

26
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,910
and throw all of my crimson yarn robes away.

27
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,160
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,270
Not only are the women in the country trying

29
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,550
to imitate Your Highness' fashion style,

30
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,360
every gentleman in the city,

31
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
no matter how discourteous it may be,

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,800
all wait for Your Highness on your way
to the Imperial Palace,

33
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,080
just to catch a glimpse of Your Highness.

34
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,600
Even if it's to see me,

35
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,470
they must still abide by the moral codes for men.

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,110
Tell them to leave,

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,320
since there is only one man in this world

38
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,030
that I take a liking to.

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,240
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Are there any other rumours about me?

41
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,470
They say that Your Highness
is beautiful and attractive.

42
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,880
They speak of how stunningly gorgeous
Your Highness is,

43
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,360
how unmatched the eloquence of
Your Highness's prose is,

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,080
and that Your Highness is the talent of
the century in Dongyue.

45
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,910
No slanderous rumours?

46
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,000
Slanderous rumours?

47
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,270
A... Absolutely none.

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,160
Speak!

49
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,320
There were two women gossiping

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,920
that you have a great figure and a round face.

51
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,270
Round?

52
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,720
No, no, no!

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,720
It's rosy! That's right, rosy, Your Highness.

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,350
Drag him out!

55
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,070
Come and take him away!

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,230
Your Highness!

57
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,040
Your Highness! Please forgive me, Your Highness!

58
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,600
It wasn't me who said that!

59
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,880
Your Highness! Your Highness!
I beg you, please forgive me!

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Your Highness!

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,350
Why is life so hard?

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,110
I've finally climbed to the top of
the social status pyramid,

63
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,070
yet my man is nowhere to be found.

64
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,230
If Cheng Cheng is in the same situation that
I once was,

65
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,040
then he would switch personalities
whenever he lies.

66
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,480
I've got to test it out.

67
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,390
Jing Xin.

68
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,880
Your Highness.

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,640
No slacking off during work.

70
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,320
Slacking off?

71
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,670
Get a ride ready,

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm going to visit Mo Residence.

73
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,200
Your Highness, you're still going to
the Mo Residence?

74
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,160
Is there anything wrong with that?

75
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,270
Nothing.

76
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,440
Cheng Cheng,

77
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,110
you've got to do it this time.

78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,950
No matter what,

79
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,230
you need to come out and see me.

80
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,200
Please.

81
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,540
(Mo Residence)

82
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,480
Your Highness, my elder brother is not here
at the moment.

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
I've come here for you.

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,640
I want to tell you that

85
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,640
I forgive you for yesterday's incident.

86
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,550
I thank Your Highness for her mercy.

87
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,230
I shall take my leave now.

88
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,760
I just... have a favour to ask of you.

89
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,480
As long as that favour causes no harm to others,

90
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,830
especially to my elder brother,

91
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
then I will do everything I can to fulfill
the request of Your Highness.

92
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,760
I wouldn't do anything that harms others.

93
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,390
I want you to tell me a small lie.

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,350
You're asking me to lie?

95
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,510
I don't know how.

96
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,670
You're too humble, Mo Lian Cheng.

97
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,790
If you don't know how,

98
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,350
then who was the one who fooled me
with the divorce paper,

99
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,480
and who was the one who lied to me,
saying that he was still unsatisfied?

100
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,040
Wait... then he lied already, isn't it?!

101
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,760
Has he switched yet?

102
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,550
Don't worry. Do you think I can do anything

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,470
in broad daylight?

104
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,280
You can't in broad daylight,

105
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,760
but that doesn't mean you can
in the dead of night.

106
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,150
I still want an explanation regarding

107
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,670
Your Highness' harassment towards me
yesterday.

108
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Who harassed you?

109
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,790
That was...

110
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,080
Who harassed you?

111
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,470
Eldest Brother, you misunderstood.

112
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,280
But just now, I clearly heard...

113
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,230
It wasn't harassment.

114
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,710
I'm just afraid that people
would belittle me for it.

115
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,350
Well, that was an outstanding lie.

116
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,030
What a pro.

117
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,350
The incident that happened during

118
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,470
the Harem Selection was not all your fault.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Her Highness has helped clear your name.

120
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,230
You must also try to cope with it.

121
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,110
Yes.

122
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,110
Then... I will stop bothering you guys.

123
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,150
You...

124
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,320
He still hasn't switched.

125
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,150
My eighth brother still needs some time.

126
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,880
I will do all I can to persuade him.

127
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,760
I can't believe lying doesn't work on
Mo Lian Cheng.

128
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,590
That's against science.

129
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't tell me he'd have to sleep and then...

130
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,760
No no no.

131
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,150
The first two times he switched,

132
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,440
he didn't sleep either.

133
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,200
A smash to the head!

134
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
That's the only way left now.

135
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,030
It's my last resort.

136
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,230
Jing Xin.

137
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,590
Your Highness.

138
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,710
Pass along my message to the Mo Residence.

139
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,840
Tell them to let Eighth Young Master accompany me
on my trip tomorrow.

140
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,640
Just say that...

141
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,280
it's to pray for the prosperity of Dongyue.

142
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,840
The Eighth Young Master?

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
Not the Eldest Young Master?

144
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,400
Mo. Lian. Cheng.

145
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:08,840
Understood.

146
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,150
Oh dear, this is going to be such a mess.

147
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,320
Princess, Eighth Young Master is here.

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

149
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,150
Sorry to keep you waiting, Tan Er.

150
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,440
Is there anyone else in there?

151
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,440
Having fun playing hard to get?

152
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,110
You're really going to keep playing hard to get
so you can keep having fun, huh?

153
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,790
Now that all eyes on us,

154
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,440
let's see if you can harass me now.

155
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,030
I see you brought your love rival here.

156
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,670
Well, we shall see if you will regret
that decision!

157
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,470
Gentlemen, please come on in.

158
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,550
Today,

159
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,590
we will play a game of escape room

160
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,110
in this inn that's in the middle of nowhere.

161
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Now I will explain to everyone

162
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,150
how to play escape room.

163
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,710
Suppose there are a lot of carnivorous ghosts

164
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,760
in the room we are in right now.

165
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,030
We must use our own eyes

166
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,230
and hands

167
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,760
to find some...

168
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,760
to find some clues.

169
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,440
Then escape this room.

170
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,760
Clues, clues.

171
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,230
Eighth Young Master, I can't reach it.

172
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,640
Would you please help me?

173
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,080
Tan Er!

174
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Your Highness! Are you alright?

175
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,880
Who would be so malicious

176
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,520
so as to hurt us passersby?

177
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,000
That's what that man deserves.

178
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,350
Sooner or later,

179
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,080
the misfortune would return to the one
who did it.

180
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,710
You!

181
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,230
This place is cursed.

182
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's hurry up and leave.

183
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,400
It must have taken a lot of time and effort

184
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,400
for Your Highness to set up such traps.

185
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,520
Who set up traps?

186
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,520
This was supposed to be a game of escape room,

187
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,840
who knows what else lies are in store?

188
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,400
Qu Tan Er! What is this now?!

189
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,670
Your Highness!

190
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,760
Eighth Brother!

191
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,520
Eighth Young Master!

192
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,910
Have they... gone outside?

193
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,080
Come! Let's go search outside.

194
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,030
You set up all these traps
and keep harassing me.

195
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,960
What is the meaning of this?

196
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,910
I swear I didn't know about this trap!

197
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,880
Stop babbling!

198
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,200
Hurry up and figure a way out!

199
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
Stop pretending!

200
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,230
How about let's be honest with each other?

201
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,030
What is the purpose of all this?

202
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,760
I have nothing to say to you!

203
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,760
You're not my Cheng Cheng.

204
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,910
You!

205
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,550
You jerk! You heartless man!

206
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,080
I won't allow you to forget about me!

207
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,440
Stop trying to hide from me!

208
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,670
Forget? Does this have to do with my lost memory?

209
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,030
I did forget about some things

210
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
that happened between us.

211
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,790
Right?

212
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,320
I knew it!

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,110
I knew that it wasn't anything complicated.

214
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
You just lost your memory.

215
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Now we need to find a way to return to
where we once were.

216
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
You're no Eighth Young Master.

217
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,550
You're my one and only Cheng Cheng!

218
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,280
Do you still remember... the time
when you were trying to win me over?

219
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,840
You were so assertive yet gentle towards me.

220
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Tan Er, stay within three feet of me.

221
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,790
If my consort were to be gone,

222
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,440
what joy there remains in life,
what relief death would bring me, as a prince?

223
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,590
Prince?

224
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,950
Your Highness, do you mean...

225
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,470
that I once was knighted?

226
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,430
You used to be the Eighth Prince of Dongyue

227
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,800
who then became the Emperor!

228
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,640
- Princess.
- You...

229
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,230
I know that we're not in the royal palace,

230
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,110
but you still must be cautious with what you say.

231
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,430
I mean it's because you said you don't remember,

232
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
that I started talking about all this.

233
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,400
That day our son was being naughty...

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,110
Our son?!

235
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,070
Your Highness, this story is very interesting,

236
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,760
but I'm afraid I can't listen to it anymore.

237
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,190
Who was telling you a story?

238
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,470
I swear,

239
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,190
if there is even half a lie in what I said,

240
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,430
then I'll die the moment I leave my room!

241
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
There's light coming from there!

242
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,920
Let's get out first.

243
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,110
Tan Er, stay within three feet of me.

244
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,160
If my consort were to be gone,

245
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,070
what joy there remains in life,
what relief death would bring me?

246
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,400
I will protect you.

247
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,920
Those who hurt you will be my enemies.

248
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,040
Tan Er!

249
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,070
Cheng Cheng...

250
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,040
Tan Er!

251
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,800
Tan Er! It's me!

252
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,950
I'm your Cheng Cheng.

253
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,160
Cheng Cheng,

254
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,520
is that really you?

255
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,350
It's me.

256
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,310
Promise me you won't leave me again.

257
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,160
I promise.

258
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,590
I now know

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,070
why you hit me in the head.

260
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,310
You must not be further than three feet
away from me.

261
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,880
I won't be more than three inches away from you,

262
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,230
let alone three feet.

263
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,980
♪For you, I'm willing to let go of
all my glory and splendour♪

264
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,020
♪To wander the world with your hand in mine♪

265
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,500
♪Your most beautiful years
are etched into my heart♪

266
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,760
Your Highness, what happened just now?

267
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,430
Eighth Young Master, be careful,

268
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
in case there are more assassins.

269
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,950
Your Highness!

270
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,190
Your Highness!

271
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,470
Tan Er!

272
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,470
Your Highness!

273
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,280
Eighth Brother!

274
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,470
Tan Er!

275
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,470
Tan Er, please wake up!

276
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,640
Tan Er!

277
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,430
Tan Er, please wake up!

278
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,230
Perhaps it was Qu Tan Er who protected me
from the assassins?

279
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,310
It's all my fault.

280
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,040
I shouldn't have left your side.

281
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,760
Eighth Brother, are you alright?

282
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,400
I'm fine.

283
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,800
Who would've thought that there would be
assassins hiding here.

284
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,040
It's too dangerous here.

285
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,760
Thank god Her Highness and Jing Xin are here.

286
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,000
We must hurry back and report this to the officials.

287
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,230
It's a bad idea to make this incident known.

288
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,800
Someone must've taken their time to plan this,

289
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,070
so as to get Her Highness and Eighth Brother
to fall into the trap

290
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,920
and lead them to the exit where the assassins
were hiding.

291
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,800
Let's wait for Her Highness to wake up
to make any decisions.

292
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
You're right, Eldest Brother.

293
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,110
Our top priority now is to return home.

294
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,680
Let's go.

295
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,830
Let's go.

296
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,020
(Mo Residence)

297
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,520
Father, you were looking for me?

298
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,430
You left the residence without telling anyone,

299
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,070
even caused Second Princess
to almost be assassinated.

300
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,230
Do you understand the consequences of this?

301
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,880
I left for the trip
on Second Princess's invitation.

302
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,040
The assassination attempt was a coincidence.

303
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,640
What wrong did I do?

304
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Then do you know

305
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,640
that being close to Second Princess would
cause rumours to spread?

306
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,160
What I have done

307
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,040
is what you have wanted, Father.

308
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,590
Then why don't you hurry up
and let the Empress take a liking to you?

309
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,520
That is the shortcut!

310
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,310
Father is not someone who is impatient
and rushes for success.

311
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,560
So you should know that

312
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,520
allying with the Empress is not the best idea.

313
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
Her Majesty is hard to control,

314
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,230
but Second Princess is different.

315
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,110
Lian Cheng.

316
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,110
Second Princess has your eldest brother.

317
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,880
They are childhood friends,

318
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,110
which makes it much easier!

319
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,230
I think that

320
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,470
Eldest Brother is very devoted
to Second Princess.

321
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,280
Father, can you really be sure that

322
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,070
between Second Princess and Father,

323
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,640
he will take your side?

324
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,070
So that's why you are trying to befriend
Second Princess?

325
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,950
Beware of your plan backfiring.

326
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,920
Your Highness, you're awake.

327
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,560
Where am I?

328
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,520
This is the Mo Residence.

329
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,920
After you lost consciousness,

330
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,470
you were brought here to rest.

331
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,000
Are you okay?

332
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,590
I'm fine.

333
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,430
Don't worry.

334
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,190
What about Mo Lian Cheng? How is he?

335
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,760
And the others?

336
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Are they alright?

337
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,350
The three young masters
of the Mo family are all fine.

338
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,430
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

339
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,310
What's going on?

340
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,310
Do I have to get hurt in order for him to switch?

341
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,590
Something's off.

342
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,430
Why did he switch back all of a sudden?

343
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
We have yet to report the assassination.

344
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,400
Please guide us, Your Highness.

345
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,430
Who else is there that wants me dead
other than that person?

346
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,350
Unfortunately, I don't have any evidence right now.

347
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,760
There's no firm evidence that points to her.

348
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,710
Your Highness, are you really alright?

349
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,830
I really am fine.

350
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,350
Just look at my strong body.

351
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,520
Well, since I've been severely hurt...

352
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,040
What do you say if I rest for a little longer?

353
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,950
Your Highness, do you mean that you'll be
staying at the Mo Residence for some time?

354
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,880
But I heard that

355
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,310
Mo Feng Yang, General Mo,
will be returning today.

356
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,520
Mo Feng Yang?

357
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,950
What kind of new character did I unlock now?

358
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,160
Why are you surprised, Your Highness?

359
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,070
General Mo has always been an important figure
to Dongyue.

360
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,040
It's the sister Shi Si mentioned.
[*"Shi Si" means Fourteen]

361
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,190
I haven't figured out Mo Lian Cheng yet,

362
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,640
and now a general appears.

363
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Forget about that general,

364
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,230
Mo Lian Cheng, I am onto you!

365
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,040
Jing Xin.

366
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,640
Yes, Your Highness.

367
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,470
Go to find the Eighth Young Master.

368
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,280
Understood.

369
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,040
Eighth Young Master.

370
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,310
I changed into some clean clothes,

371
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,590
so I took a little longer.

372
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,830
Are you alright?

373
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
Sorry to have dragged you
into this and frightened you.

374
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
Since Your Highness is still hurt,

375
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,520
I shall take a leave.

376
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,160
Since when did Your Highness have
pulmonary problems?

377
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:29,230
Headache, fatigue, weariness.

378
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
Young Master Mo,

379
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,310
can you bring me my medicine?

380
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
It's right there.

381
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,640
So painful.

382
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,190
I'm so exhausted.

383
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I can't even lift my hand.

384
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,710
How about you feed me?

385
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,830
Then I'll go call Jing Xin over.

386
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,560
Don't.

387
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,190
Jing Xin is a guard and she's clumsy.

388
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,590
How about you do it?

389
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,430
Come closer.

390
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,830
I can't reach it.

391
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,110
Tan Er, why did you get up?

392
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,040
Feeling better?

393
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,000
Here.

394
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,190
I shouldn't bother you to do this, Eighth Brother.

395
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,470
Tan Er,

396
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,190
if you don't get any better,

397
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,230
that'd be a problem.

398
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,040
Here, drink this.

399
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,800
I've had two bowls of this medicine already!

400
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,310
Yet I don't feel it working.

401
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,560
That's what I said! You can't just take medicine!

402
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,470
I'll find an imperial physician for you.

403
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Sure!

404
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,880
Let Jing Xin go with you.

405
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,830
Alright, get some rest.

406
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
I'll return in just a moment.

407
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,830
Jing Xin!

408
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,380
(Mo Residence)

409
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,880
Feng Yang.

410
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,590
Sister!

411
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,430
There.

412
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Father, I have conquered Fort Gu Feng

413
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,830
and returned victoriously.

414
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,950
You are the hero of Dongyue,

415
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,040
the pride of the Mo Family,

416
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,800
and my outstanding daughter.

417
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,710
Feng Yang!

418
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,560
Eldest Brother.

419
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,760
It's good to see you back.

420
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,830
It must've been hard for you all these years,

421
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,760
being away from home and fighting battles.

422
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,680
Jing Xin and I are going to find
an imperial physician for Tan Er.

423
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,160
Let's talk more when we come back.

424
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,430
Feng Yang.

425
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,280
Sister! You're truly the heroine of our Dongyue.

426
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,830
Shi Si, you've grown up a lot.

427
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:23,880
Feng Yang,

428
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,760
Second Princess and Lian Cheng
went out for a trip,

429
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
but unfortunately came face-to-face
with assassins.

430
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
Her Highness is resting at our mansion for now.

431
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,830
Lian Cheng is looking after her,
so he's a bit late.

432
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,190
Let's go in, shall we?

433
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,920
On my way back, I heard rumours
about Eighth Brother.

434
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,230
Seeing that he is personally taking care of
Her Highness now,

435
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,190
it appears that I've missed out on
a lot of things.

436
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,800
Feng Yang should go to the guest's room first

437
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,190
to pay my respects to Her Highness.

438
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,760
Feng Yang.

439
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,070
I've been sick for so long.

440
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,950
Why don't you carry me and take me for a walk?

441
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,470
It has only been a while,

442
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,760
and you're going for a walk again?

443
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,830
I'm just so fatigued.

444
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,310
I'm so exhausted.

445
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,590
You two!

446
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

447
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Looks like the assassins did not spare you guys.

448
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,350
They even broke Your Highness's leg.

449
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,070
Don't worry.

450
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,230
I've just been lying down for too long,
and am feeling a little sore.

451
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,520
My four limbs are all intact.

452
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,040
Then Your Highness should be careful during
your future outings,

453
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,430
bring some more guards to ensure your safety.

454
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,880
Eighth Brother, don't bother Her Highness anymore.

455
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,190
You must report to Father before
you leave the mansion.

456
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,400
Now that we've greeted Your Highness,

457
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,710
Eighth Brother and I will take our leave

458
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,190
so that Your Highness can rest peacefully.

459
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,110
Farewell.

460
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,190
You!

461
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,950
We're not in the army,

462
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,430
shouldn't you tone down

463
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,680
your commanding general demeanor a little?

464
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,160
It has only been a year and you've become
much more unyielding.

465
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,830
Who gave you the courage?

466
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,590
The empress? Or is it the second princess?

467
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,470
It has only been a year,

468
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,430
yet where is all this resentment coming from?

469
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,190
Being touchy-feely in the same room,

470
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,950
getting all affectionate when
it's only afternoon,

471
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,800
feeding her medicine and food,
and being with her every day.

472
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,040
Do you realize that you've become

473
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
the laughing stock of the folks?

474
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,040
What use is there if I earn all this honour
for our family

475
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,280
only to have you squander it!

476
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,830
What you've said is not what I intend.

477
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,470
You've directed your anger at the wrong person.

478
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,190
She ignores Eldest Brother and has a fickle mind.

479
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,830
But look at you!

480
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,190
If it weren't for you seducing her,

481
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,680
how would she have noticed you?

482
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,430
You're confusing right and wrong.
What a joke!

483
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,830
I may be low in seniority,

484
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,070
but I am the only daughter of the Mo household.

485
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,070
I must protect the Mo Family's reputation
for Mother.

486
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,000
Mo Feng Yang!

487
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,400
I ordered Mo Lian Cheng's every action.

488
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,350
On the surface, you're scolding him,

489
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,560
but who you actually want to scold is me, right?

490
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,830
I would never dare to.

491
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,680
It's my elder brother who should
stop being careless.

492
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,760
Being an important figure to Dongyue,

493
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,160
why are you so conservative, so narrow-minded,

494
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,590
so gullible, and so arrogant?

495
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,800
Careless? Against the moral codes for men?

496
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,830
I think you're just too hung up on matriarchy!

497
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,590
You won't stop talking about rules and precepts.

498
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Those are nothing but prejudices.

499
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,710
You...

500
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,310
Qu Tan Er spoke up for me.

501
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,400
Why do her thoughts

502
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
coincide with mine?

503
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,040
Cheng Cheng!

504
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,800
Cheng Cheng!

505
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,430
Your Highness, who are you calling for?

506
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,920
Calling for my dear, my husband.

507
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,190
My Cheng Cheng!

508
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,680
You watched me fall again.

509
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,310
It's like this every time.

510
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,920
What's going on?

511
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,400
You don't know me? Again?

512
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,110
Since Your Highness

513
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,350
has helped restore my reputation,

514
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,430
her Majesty will certainly take pity on me.

515
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
Your Highness needn't worry.

516
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,190
What do you mean?

517
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,310
You're still thinking of being into
the harem?

518
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,160
If she was just using those words to deceive me,

519
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,040
that'd be too awkward of a lie.

520
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,680
Furthermore,

521
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,950
how could I frequently overstep boundaries

522
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,880
and not recognize my actions?

523
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,710
Did she mistake me for someone else

524
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,560
or was I really involved with her in the past?

525
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,400
You jerk! You heartless man!

526
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,760
I won't allow you to forget about me!
Stop trying to hide from me!

527
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,830
You used to be the Eighth Prince of Dongyue

528
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,230
who then became the Emperor!

529
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,350
I swear,

530
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,920
if there is even half a lie in what I said,

531
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,520
then I'll die the moment I leave my room!

532
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,230
Careless? Against the moral codes for men?

533
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,920
I think you're just too hung up on matriarchy!

534
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,110
You won't stop talking about rules and precepts.

535
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,310
Those are nothing but prejudices.

536
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,040
Her state of mind impresses me

537
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,710
and coincides with mine,

538
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,070
even more than Father's.

539
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,590
To seek her help

540
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,920
would be way more efficient than
marrying the Empress.

541
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,160
Since she has taken a liking to me,

542
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,160
it'd be a win-win.

543
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,520
Don't these men

544
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,840
feel embarrassed for writing

545
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,600
such cheesy greeting cards?

546
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,150
These noble childes admire Your Highness

547
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,560
so much that they're impossible to turn away.

548
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,080
A word from the Empress.

549
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,280
Your Highness, please manage
your subordinates well.

550
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,120
If it were to happen again,

551
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,870
the consequences will be severe.

552
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,520
Your Majesty, the assassination incident has been
taken care of.

553
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,840
From what I can see,

554
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,470
Second Princess has become more bold
than before.

555
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,760
Exactly right, Your Majesty.

556
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,870
According to our scouts,

557
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,840
Her Highness indeed seems odd.

558
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,710
After she had awoken from falling
into the water,

559
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,470
her temperament has become a lot more lively.

560
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,150
She even dared to

561
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,760
say that men and women are equal,

562
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,670
and even criticized matriarchy.

563
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,760
How has the Mo Residence been recently?

564
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,910
Mo Yuan Long has been living in seclusion.

565
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
No signs of treason.

566
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,360
The Eighth Young Master of the Mo family has been
punished quite frequently, seems quite down.

567
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,280
In the end, the young master of the Mo family
is not him.

568
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,800
If the wind shifts,

569
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,360
there's no need to keep him.

570
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,230
Yes, your Majesty.
