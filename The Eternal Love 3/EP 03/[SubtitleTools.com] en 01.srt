Cheng...

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,160
There's no need to hide.

18
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,390
Are the two beauties I married today

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,960
both in the room?

20
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,910
My two beauties,

21
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,440
sorry to have kept you waiting.

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Isn't this exciting?

23
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,160
Curious about what happened?

24
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,190
The story began

25
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,750
a month ago.

26
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,750
As per quantum physics,

27
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,960
the universe is continually expanding
from a speck.

28
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,630
After reaching its limit,

29
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,550
it'll tear away to form multiple
parallel universes.

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,720
You won't know which day, or moment,

31
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,600
a new universe, a new Dongyue,

32
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,440
will be born.

33
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,190
But at this moment, this is still
the same Dongyue.

34
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,520
A Dongyue governed by
Emperor Mo Lian Cheng and

35
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,830
his Empress, Qu Xiao Tan.

36
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,390
You two, head over there to look for it.

37
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,240
Yes.

38
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,960
Little Prince.

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,830
Yu Er.

40
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,830
Little Prince.

41
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,900
(A loving family)

42
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,550
Xiao Tan, look at this.

43
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,720
The Little Prince

44
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,750
threw his homework everywhere.

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
What should we do?

46
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,470
Stupid Mo Lian Cheng.

47
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,760
He's having it so easy.

48
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,270
Why should I be the one taking care of the child

49
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
and helping him with his homework?

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,550
Mo Lian Cheng, that bastard.

51
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,000
To think he said he'd be the one
to bear children in the next lifetime.

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
I regret bearing a child with him
even in this lifetime.

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,200
So what if he's the Emperor?

54
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,230
I still have my real estate career.

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Yu Er, Yu Er!

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,830
This drawing is pretty good.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,070
Assassins!

58
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm sorry for not coming in time.

59
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,830
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

60
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,230
It's okay.

61
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,200
Yu Er,

62
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,600
if you really don't feel like learning,

63
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,920
go take an afternoon nap.

64
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,350
If you're going to keep behaving like this,

65
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm going to collapse soon.

66
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,950
I'm not learning, I'm not learning,
I refuse!

67
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,670
What happened? Upset with Yu Er again?

68
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,350
Isn't Yu Er quite well-behaved?

69
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,110
You taught him well.

70
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,670
You have a talent for raising children.

71
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,070
Forget it, I'm not teaching him.

72
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,550
Just let him be a happy little fool.

73
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,670
Yu Er is a prince of Dongyue,

74
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,950
the future Emperor,

75
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
and an upright and strong man.

76
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,470
How can he be a little fool?

77
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,230
If he were a girl,

78
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,520
he would be able to freely…

79
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,030
What do you mean by "if he were a girl"?

80
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,440
What's wrong with being a girl?

81
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,280
Mo Lian Cheng, you're being sexist.

82
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,200
Tan Er, stop messing around.

83
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,840
You're tired, I'm tired too.

84
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,150
Men should be upright and strong,

85
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,880
but women can be little fools, is that it?

86
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,030
You're the one who brought about "fool".

87
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,400
Men can go to work, earn money,
and become the Emperor.

88
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,110
Women just stay home, wash clothes, cook,
and raise children.

89
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,840
Is that it?

90
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,670
Since when have you washed clothes or cooked?

91
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,150
The servants have always been the ones
doing the work.

92
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,840
Stay away from me. I'm frustrated.

93
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,520
Look at me.

94
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,000
My hands are red, I haven't even washed them.

95
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,470
Okay, okay.

96
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
I have to attend court every day,

97
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,590
and pamper you and Yu Er afterwards.

98
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm tired too.

99
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,280
You're not the only one who's tired,
I'm tired too.

100
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,880
At the outskirts of the city with Yu Hao just now,
we...

101
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,640
Yu Er!

102
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,230
Yu Er!

103
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,030
Yu Er!

104
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,400
Didn't Qu Jiang Lin die a long time ago?

105
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,790
Am I seeing ghosts?

106
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,760
This must be a nightmare.

107
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,440
I need to go back to sleep, back to sleep,

108
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,350
Your Highness, don't be scared.
I'm here for you.

109
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,880
Jing Xin?

110
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,280
Your Highness, why are you frightened?

111
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,350
I'm here, I will ensure your safety.

112
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,320
Highness?

113
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,400
That's right.

114
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,000
Your Highness has finally woken up,
this is great news.

115
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,320
You've just recovered,

116
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm afraid you may still be in shock.

117
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,670
Still in shock?

118
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,710
Yes, I'm still in shock.

119
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,640
Don't come any closer.

120
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,230
Stay away from me.

121
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,400
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng!

122
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,590
Yu Er, where's Yu Er?

123
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,200
Cheng Cheng, Yu Er, where are you?

124
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
The Soul-guarding Pearl was unstable.

125
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Could it be that time has been tampered with?

126
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,150
That can't be.

127
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,880
Before Qu Jiang Lin died,

128
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,400
I hadn't become the princess either.

129
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,000
Tan Er,

130
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,150
what's wrong with you?

131
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,470
You're the second princess of Dongyue!

132
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,440
You'll have a chance to inherit
the empire in the future.

133
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,200
You mustn't develop any bad habits.

134
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,670
Inherit the empire?

135
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,550
Me?

136
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,470
Inherit what position?

137
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,150
What's going on?

138
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,470
How did falling into the water
damage your brain this much?

139
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,910
Tan Er, let me be honest with you.

140
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,910
The Empress initially thought more highly of you.

141
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,080
But looking at you now,

142
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,080
the responsibility can only fall

143
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,590
onto your elder sister, Mei Er's shoulders.

144
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,710
Think it through carefully.

145
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
Mei Er?

146
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,880
Elder sister Mei Er?

147
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,200
I fell into the water?

148
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,670
No, no, no, no.

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,150
It's not what you think.

150
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,640
Your elder sister Mei Er is your only kin.

151
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,880
I swear on my life,

152
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,320
you falling into the water
had nothing to do with her.

153
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,470
Could it be that Qu Mei Er is Qu Pan Er?

154
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
The names changed?

155
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,670
But looking at how protective
Qu Jiang Lin is being,

156
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,080
it could very well be that Tan Er
falling into the water this time

157
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,760
was caused by this new elder sister.

158
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,400
You've been alive all this time?

159
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,280
You've always been a guard?

160
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,520
Tan Er, think about it.

161
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,200
Both you and Mei Er's mothers passed away early.

162
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,200
Wasn't it me

163
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,910
who raised both of you by myself?

164
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,000
If you still don't believe your father,

165
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,440
your mother up in heaven right now
wouldn't be pleased.

166
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,030
Okay, okay, okay.

167
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,760
Let me ask you.

168
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,880
I'm Princess Qu Tan Er,

169
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,280
and my elder sister is Qu Mei Er?

170
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,320
Yes.

171
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,110
I'm done for.

172
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,710
Don't tell me I...

173
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,350
What kind of luck do I have?

174
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,280
It seems that I've entered a universe
in which gender roles are reversed.

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,400
Then... what about Cheng Cheng?

176
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,790
And my Yu Er?

177
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,200
Cheng Cheng?

178
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,910
My Tan Er!

179
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,790
No, I can't trust Qu Jiang Lin.

180
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,710
Before I find out where Cheng Cheng is,

181
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,080
I can't carelessly reveal his existence.

182
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,230
I'll pretend to be Qu Tan Er

183
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,000
and try to get some inside info first.

184
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,470
Father,

185
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,670
I think my brain has indeed been damaged
after falling into the water.

186
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,840
But

187
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,590
I don't blame elder sister Mei Er.

188
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,550
But others might read more into it.

189
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,960
As a father,

190
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,110
I think

191
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,030
you're in a difficult position, right?

192
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,280
Yes.

193
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,520
Although I'm the Empress's cousin,

194
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm still just a man.

195
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,470
What?

196
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,760
He's the Empress's cousin?

197
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
The Empress is my aunt?

198
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
My new sister and I are princesses?

199
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,280
This is a mess, it's all a mess.

200
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,520
Father, you must have suffered.

201
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,670
You're a man and you were born in the palace.

202
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,110
Life mustn't be easy for you.

203
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,470
As a man, it's never easy.

204
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,710
According to the rules of Dongyue,

205
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,760
men are subordinate to women.

206
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,960
After all, women

207
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,350
have to train themselves to govern the country.

208
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,080
Men should be loyal husbands,

209
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,440
and be virtuous and submissive.

210
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,280
The ruling Empress has no children,

211
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,400
so she wants to choose between you and Mei Er

212
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,150
to inherit the throne.

213
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm happy for the both of you.

214
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,640
But I'm also worried and being extremely careful.

215
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,400
I'm afraid something bad might happen.

216
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,280
Tan Er, you've always been gentle and magnanimous.

217
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,840
I just want you and Mei Er to get along well,

218
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,000
so that I can have peace in my mind.

219
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,320
If I hadn't known what kind of person you were,

220
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,550
I would've actually believed you.

221
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,910
I understand.

222
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,320
Just that...

223
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,640
I'm not feeling too well now.

224
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,960
I want to take a rest.

225
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,710
Don't worry, Father.

226
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,280
How about you head back first?

227
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,550
Okay, okay, okay.

228
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,520
Look at me.

229
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,520
I got carried away because I was so happy

230
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,590
to see that you've recovered.

231
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,710
Your Highness, do take care.

232
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,800
Jing Xin, do you know

233
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,070
someone called Mo Lian Cheng?

234
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
The eighth young master of the Mo family?

235
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,830
Yes, yes, that's him.

236
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Where is he now?

237
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,350
He should be in the palace today
taking part in the harem selection.

238
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,230
He should be waiting to be selected
at this very moment.

239
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,560
Harem selection?

240
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,190
Is that what I think it is?

241
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,470
It's to be chosen as part of the Empress's harem.

242
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,070
Your Highness, where are you going?

243
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
Snatching my groom.

244
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,350
Come.

245
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,880
Eighth Brother, why are you nervous?

246
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,640
With your qualifications,
you can definitely get chosen.

247
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,590
In any case, the Empress had long ago...

248
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,400
Eldest Brother,

249
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,760
I've spoken too much.

250
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,040
But ever since the accident,

251
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,680
you've become sullen and quiet.

252
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,880
You used to be very familiar with Her Majesty.

253
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,430
I sincerely wish

254
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,040
you may be together with the one you love.

255
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,710
Be together with the one you love?

256
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,000
As expected as the Eighth Young Master of Mo family.

257
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,640
But… who have you gotten involved with

258
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,070
before you've gotten married?

259
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,800
Young Master Su, please mind your words.

260
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
We are before the Empress's palace.

261
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
We are indeed before the Empress's palace,

262
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,400
also a familiar place to Eighth Young Master.

263
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,920
I wonder why he's joining the selection
together with us.

264
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,830
I thought

265
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Eighth Young Master had joined the harem long ago.

266
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,520
According to my understanding,

267
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
the supervising officer today is Official Su,

268
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,160
who is Young Master Su's eldest sister.

269
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,470
Did she not arrange for you
to participate in the selection?

270
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
You're spouting rubbish!

271
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,950
You dare accuse my eldest sister
of practicing favoritism!

272
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,230
Eighth Brother.

273
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,800
You…!

274
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,110
Given Young Master Su's personality,

275
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,880
you should speak less,

276
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
in case you cause trouble for Official Su.

277
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,350
Eighth Brother...

278
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,880
Eldest Brother, don't worry.

279
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay, then I'll see you off here.

280
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,000
I look forward to hearing good news from you.

281
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

282
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,920
Rise.

283
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,070
Greetings, Your Highness.

284
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
You may rise.

285
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

286
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

287
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,680
All rise.

288
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,230
It's different being a princess now.

289
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,310
This is awesome.

290
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,950
Jing Xin, do they all know me?

291
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,920
Everyone in the palace would.

292
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,560
Some of the lower-ranking servants
outside the palace

293
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,230
may not.

294
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,430
Your Highness,

295
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,590
you dropped this.

296
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,800
This perfume sachet is quite pretty.

297
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,350
Let me help you put it on.

298
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,760
I was in a hurry to leave the house
earlier this morning,

299
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,280
and almost made a big mistake.

300
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,400
This perfume sachet was presented
by the Empress.

301
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,470
The perfume powder inside is extremely precious.

302
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,110
Butterflies love this scent the most.

303
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,470
Aren't you a guard?

304
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,350
How do you know so much about perfume powders?

305
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,560
I naturally know every single detail

306
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,280
about Your Highness. It's my duty.

307
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,430
I know what girls are thinking.

308
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng!

309
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,680
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng!

310
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,000
Your Highness, who are you calling?

311
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,520
My dear, my husband.

312
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,680
My Cheng Cheng!

313
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,680
Cheng Cheng!

314
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,560
Your Highness, please stop shouting.

315
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,950
They're waiting to be selected into the harem.

316
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,470
Before they're chosen,
they're considered the Empress's men.

317
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,040
Why would your husband be there?

318
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,400
In any case, you're not engaged yet.

319
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,920
That's true.

320
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,950
There are many people in this palace,
I mustn't expose myself.

321
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,520
I should figure out the situation first.

322
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

323
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,230
Your Highness, what are you doing?

324
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,880
I need to find a way to sneak in.

325
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,800
Sneak?

326
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,070
Second Princess.

327
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,400
Greetings, Official Su.

328
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,280
Greetings, Second Princess.

329
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,310
Could I know what you intend to do?

330
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm just having a look around.

331
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,280
I wasn't thinking of going in.

332
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,520
How can that be?

333
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,710
Her Majesty selected Your Highness and me

334
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,000
to co-host the harem selection.

335
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,190
If you don't go in, how will we select the harem?

336
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,110
Co-host?

337
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm just coming here to observe first.

338
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,000
Su… Official Su...

339
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,160
I'll leave it to you to handle this harem selection.

340
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,830
It's my duty.

341
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,040
Her Majesty already instructed me.

342
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,680
Your Highness only needs to attend it.

343
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,560
So she's Su Yue La,

344
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,830
the Empress's trusted aide.

345
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,160
These months, I've been trying to cover up,

346
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
and adapt to my surroundings as much as possible,

347
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
so that no one would realize I've lost my memory.

348
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,640
But I still feel that

349
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
the rules in this universe are hard for me to grasp.

350
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,070
Men are beneath women?

351
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,040
Abide by a code of virtue and be a loyal husband?

352
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,310
These practices are all so restrictive.

353
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,110
I just can't believe

354
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,040
I was raised in such an environment.

355
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,560
I'm trying to figure out
how things end up this way.

356
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,430
Eighth Brother, you're awake.

357
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,590
Lian Cheng.

358
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Cheng Cheng,

359
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,430
Cheng Cheng,

360
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,350
Cheng Cheng.

361
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,040
Cheng Cheng, I'm not the Empress.

362
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,830
You've misunderstood.

363
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,640
So you don't need to enter the harem.

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,520
Pay attention to my signals during
the next selection process.

365
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,430
I'll find a way to get you eliminated.

366
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
Forgive me, Your Highness.

367
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
You've misspoken.

368
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,350
You know I'm the princess?

369
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,880
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you were saying.

370
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,560
May Your Highness

371
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,680
please stop speaking such heresy.

372
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,640
Can't you recognize me?

373
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,190
Oh, there are many people here, it's not convenient.

374
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,640
Young Master Mo,

375
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
you passed the test with flying colours.

376
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,070
I have much admiration for you.

377
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,710
I must encourage you.

378
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
Keep up the good work!

379
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,830
Everyone, keep up the good work!

380
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,110
Keep it up!

381
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,400
Go, go, go!

382
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,710
Where did he go?

383
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,760
Forget it.

384
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,350
I should find a way to get him eliminated first.

385
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,280
Then I'll find an opportunity to bump into him.

386
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,470
Not handsome enough. Eliminated.

387
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,880
The water is too hot. Eliminated.

388
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,760
There's dirt between your fingernails. Eliminated.

389
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,470
The tea isn't clean. Eliminated.

390
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,040
Pieces of your scalp have even fallen into the cup.

391
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,950
Eliminated!

392
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,880
You…

393
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,430
What's up with him?

394
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,470
He's not making any mistakes himself.

395
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,710
The tea is overflowing. Eliminated.

396
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,230
Looks like this difficult little punk

397
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,230
doesn't want Mo Lian Cheng
to get through even more than me.

398
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,830
I'm depending on you.

399
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,040
Bold of you!

400
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,190
Mo Lian Cheng has no manners! Eliminated!

401
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,640
I thought we were being tested
on our knowledge and skills of preparing tea.

402
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,430
I didn't know we were being tested on our agility.

403
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,590
You spilled water on me,

404
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,800
and now you're mocking me?

405
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,760
Insubordination!

406
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,640
Get out of here immediately!

407
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,400
This...

408
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,880
Your Highness… Your Highness, what's going on?

409
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,070
You and I both know he belongs to Her Majesty.

410
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,590
Why offend Her Majesty

411
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
over such a small thing?

412
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,230
Official Su, you're saying that

413
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,430
he must be selected no matter what?

414
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,520
I shall be magnanimous.

415
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,560
As long as Mo Lian Cheng
serves me and changes my outfit,

416
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
I'll forgive you just this once.

417
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,800
Bring some clean clothes for me.

418
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,560
But…

419
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,470
I wouldn't dare deny the order from Your Highness.

420
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,110
What's going on?

421
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,590
(Jing Yi Pavilion)
Cheng Cheng, I can’t do this by myself.

422
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,280
Come and give me a hand.

423
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,830
There are boundaries between men and women.

424
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,160
May Your Highness stop addressing me
like that, please.

425
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,800
You really don't know who I am?

426
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,350
Your Highness, I know you are the second princess.

427
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,880
So frustrating.

428
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,950
But he doesn't look like he's pretending.

429
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,950
But it doesn't seem like
he has lost your memory either.

430
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,110
Don't tell me this is just like the previous time.

431
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,040
He's the Mo Lian Cheng from this parallel universe.

432
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,280
Cheng Cheng was assassinated before.

433
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,000
I should confirm this first.

434
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,430
It seems that your clothes are wet as well.

435
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,430
How about we change out together?

436
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,310
Your Highness, are you teasing me?

437
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,470
What are you talking about?

438
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,400
Why would I be teasing you?

439
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,760
I'm concerned about you.

440
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,280
Can't you tell?

441
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,590
So fast?

442
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,280
Didn't you want to take a look?

443
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,000
Why are you being shy now?

444
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,920
If Your Highness has mercy on me,

445
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,000
and won't tell anyone about this,

446
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,000
I have no issues with
letting Your Highness have a look.

447
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,310
Don't worry, I won't.

448
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,160
He's really not Cheng Cheng.

449
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,280
What was she saying about pretending just now?

450
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,590
And now she wants to inspect my body?

451
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,000
Does she know something?

452
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
I've finished changing.

454
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,430
I'll be leaving now.

455
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,110
Please wait, Your Highness.

456
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,880
Don't worry,

457
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,560
I'll take it that nothing happened today.

458
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,310
I won't say a word. It won't affect your reputation.

459
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,280
When asking me to change just now,

460
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,880
it didn't seem like

461
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,710
Your Highness was someone who would care about
the reputation of others.

462
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,470
I asked you to change,

463
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
not to remove your clothes for me.

464
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,830
What were you looking for, Your Highness?

465
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,430
How about having a better look?

466
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,040
It's okay, it's okay, I got the wrong person.

467
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,590
Your Highness seems to be
looking for something indeed.

468
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I was looking for some excitement.

469
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,070
I'm looking for excitement, okay?

470
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,830
I hope you can become the Emperor Consort soon.

471
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,880
I'm in a hurry to look for someone.
I'll be taking my leave.

472
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,470
Goodbye.

473
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,190
Your Highness.

474
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,230
Your Highness, you're done changing?

475
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,710
Let's hurry.

476
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,000
The other candidates
are still waiting to be selected.

477
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,110
But where is Young Master Mo?

478
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,640
He should be changing inside, I guess.

479
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,310
I'll take my leave first.

480
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,950
He doesn't need to change.

481
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,400
All candidates have to change
and be inspected before the harem selection.

482
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,350
Change?

483
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,680
Be inspected?

484
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,070
The candidates?

485
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,040
All removed their clothes?

486
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,590
This is the rule.

487
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,040
In case they have any weapons on them.

488
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,640
Of course, it's also to see

489
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,350
if there are any defects on their bodies.

490
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,830
We have to check them thoroughly.

491
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,110
They all can't compare to Cheng Cheng.

492
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,950
Too skinny.

493
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,190
But some of them are quite good-looking.

494
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,560
It would be better

495
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,520
if they had some abs.

496
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,430
Sorry.

497
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,430
Mo Lian Cheng, what are you doing?

498
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,590
You...

499
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,230
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

500
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,950
I'm staying outside to guard the place.

501
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Guarding the place?

502
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,000
Do we need Your Highness to personally
guard this place?

503
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,280
Why not? Do I owe you?

504
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,350
Why's that your business?

505
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,680
Since you're guarding the place,

506
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,560
why did you peek?

507
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,710
Stay away from me. I'm frustrated.

508
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,630
Since when did you wash the clothes or cook?

509
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,080
The servants have always been the ones
doing the work.

510
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Stay away from me. I'm frustrated.

511
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,630
Are you okay?

512
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,710
Tan Er?

513
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,910
Tan Er?

514
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,910
Cheng Cheng, is that really you?

515
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,430
What happened to you?

516
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,760
Cheng Cheng, I've really missed you.

517
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,470
Cheng Cheng.

518
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,630
Why does he not recognize me again?

519
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,150
What exactly is going on?

520
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,040
No way. If he's really Cheng Cheng,

521
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,840
I mustn't let him get selected for the harem.

522
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you okay, Your Highness?

523
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,870
Young Master Mo, since the inspection has ended,

524
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,670
prepare well for the harem selection.

525
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,910
Your Highness, please.

526
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,120
Looks like

527
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,520
I just need to help Su Jing Yuan.

528
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,600
Go in. Hurry.

529
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,120
I wonder if the empress is as pretty as they say.

530
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,120
No matter what,

531
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,120
forget about marrying my Cheng Cheng.

532
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Long live the Empress.

533
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,560
All rise.
