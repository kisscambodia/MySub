=Episode 11=

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,640
Eighth Brother.

17
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,750
Since you've already married into
the Princess's Residence,

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,640
you need to abide by a code of virtue,
be a loyal husband, and act with caution.

19
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,670
Seeing you and Her Highness bickering these days,

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,470
I feel rather worried.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
I know

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
if it were someone else, things would not
be the way they are.

23
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,390
I know you have dreams and great ambition.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,920
But marrying into the Princess's Residence

25
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,670
is the ultimate dream of so many.

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Eldest Brother.

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,950
What I want

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,950
is not always hiding behind women

29
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,360
and enjoying a luxurious lifestyle;

30
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,280
neither is it for self-realization,

31
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,160
nor to achieve what Father has been plotting for
and hurt others.

32
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,950
These years,

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,470
I've also known pieces of Father's plans.

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,030
Although I'm not in agreement,

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,390
I don't have the means to stop him either.

36
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,520
But Eighth Brother,

37
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,750
why did you willingly step into

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,440
this dangerous situation after your accident?

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,440
Eldest Brother.

40
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,870
Have you felt resentment towards me

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,830
for marrying into the Second Princess's Residence
with you?

42
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,360
Surprise, yes,

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,920
but no resentment.

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,470
Under these skies,

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,670
which good man doesn't want to marry into
a good home?

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,470
You had a poor reputation before.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,870
Second Princess was kind enough to
not give up on you.

48
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,310
I'm happy for you.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,390
Eldest Brother, you don't blame me,

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,800
but I have a guilty conscience.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
I don't want to stay in this residence
any longer.

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,080
Could you please tell me,

53
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,520
aside from running away,

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,160
is there any other way?

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
What?

56
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,750
Have you gone mad?

57
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,870
If you do this, the rest of your life will be ruined.

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,160
I've been thinking about it for quite some time.

59
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,520
You must have known it as well.

60
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,000
You needn't try to persuade me anymore.

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,870
I'll shoulder the consequences myself.

62
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,640
If you are unwilling to help me,

63
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,590
I'll do it on my own.

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,640
But how can I watch you put yourself in danger?

65
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,590
I will do as I say.

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
In order for you, as a prince consort to renounce
his marriage,

67
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,950
you have to get the divorce papers
from Her Highness.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,800
But Eighth Brother...

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
I've made up my mind.

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,120
Here.

71
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,360
If I want to get the divorce papers,

72
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,920
I'd have to fit the seven types of grounds.
[*Conditions on which a wife can cast off her husband]

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,870
Although you're not one to be compliant,

74
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,080
but the seven types of grounds

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,400
aren't that easy to commit.

76
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,270
First, "not being respectful towards female
elders in the family".

77
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,800
You've married into the royal family.

78
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Will you have to disrespect the empress?

79
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,710
About "not having a daughter".

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,150
You and Tan Er haven't been married for long.

81
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,240
How can they determine whether you can or cannot
give birth to a daughter?

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,920
Aside from "being wanton",

83
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,550
only "being overly jealous", "having a big mouth",

84
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,470
"stealing", and "being unfilial" are left.

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,030
Others will only think that I am unscrupulous.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,840
The Mo Family will definitely be implicated.

87
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,310
Or maybe

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,710
I could try being seriously ill?

89
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,680
Did you know that every type of grounds

90
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,270
is considered to be a heinous offense?

91
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,200
It would be impossible for you to remarry.

92
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,870
I'm aware.

93
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,080
There's even the danger of being drowned.

94
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,960
Eldest Brother, don't worry.

95
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,870
I'll be sure to take care of myself.

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Could you listen to my advice once more?

97
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,400
Eldest Brother, please help me.

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Eighth Brother.

99
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,030
Eighth Brother, listen to me.

100
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,030
Was I sincerely trying to persuade Lian Cheng?

101
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,800
But Tan Er has changed too much.

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,640
These changes shouldn't happen anymore.

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,700
(Princess's Residence)

104
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,550
Qu Xiao Tan.

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
He who gives you the cold shoulder is not
your Cheng Cheng.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,430
You've definitely not been given the cold shoulder.

107
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,470
Cheng Cheng.

108
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,470
A batch of delicious peaches has arrived,

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,840
I wanted to give you...

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,430
Stop screaming.

111
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,920
It's me.

112
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,870
Yu Hao, you scared me to death.

113
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,150
- Your Highness, something terrible has happened.
- You scared me.

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,150
I was just on my way to report to you.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
Last night, Young Master started feeling fatigued,

116
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,240
and then exhibited diarrhea.

117
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,030
I called the doctor over right away.

118
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,550
The doctor said that this illness is contagious.

119
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,470
Young Master might not be able to live in
the Snow Court for much longer.

120
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,710
Your Highness.

121
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,030
The secondary prince consort's room is on fire.

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,150
No, no, no.

123
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,310
It's the rhizoma atractylodis incense.

124
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
We're burning it.

125
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,030
He was so lively yesterday,

126
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I can't believe he's this sick just a day later.

127
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,470
Exactly.

128
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,750
This illness seems serious.

129
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,030
I only spoke a few words with the prince consort
yesterday.

130
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,120
I may have been infected too.

131
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,470
I need to go take a look.

132
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,120
Your Highness. You mustn't go in.

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,360
You really mustn't go in.

134
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,030
To ensure your safety, you two cannot go in.

135
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,590
Your Highness.

136
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,430
Your Highness. To be safe,

137
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,430
it'd be better if you don't go inside.

138
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,560
They're coming in.

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,470
- Cheng Cheng.
- Your Highness.

140
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,080
Hurry.

141
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,470
- Pull it over.
- Cheng Cheng, how are you?

142
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,120
Cheng Cheng.

143
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,990
- Your Highness.
- Cheng Cheng.

144
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,150
The secondary prince consort has come down
with a serious illness.

145
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,150
Very contagious. He needs to be quarantined.

146
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,310
This serious?

147
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,030
Your Highness. Please don't get too close.

148
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,240
Cheng Cheng.

149
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,520
Cheng Cheng, how do you feel?

150
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,080
Cheng Cheng, I'm sorry.

151
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,270
It's all my fault.

152
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,270
I was being too pushy.

153
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,030
But you can't get sick here,

154
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
we have to go back together.

155
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,590
Cheng Cheng.

156
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,680
Your Highness.

157
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,470
Your Highness mustn't come closer.

158
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,870
If you do

159
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,030
and something bad happens,

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,720
I'd have to die ten thousand times over.

161
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,230
How is it your fault?

162
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,310
Stop talking about death and such.

163
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,200
As long as I'm here,

164
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,430
don't you ever speak that word again.

165
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,200
We said we'd never leave each other.

166
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,400
Alright.

167
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,110
Rest well. Stop talking.

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Leave us.

169
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,080
If this illness is contagious,

170
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,790
I'll stay with him on my own.

171
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,520
Don't want you to get sick too.

172
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
You mustn't, Your Highness.

173
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,990
Leave us.

174
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,990
Your Highness.

175
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,870
Cheng Cheng. Cheng Cheng.

176
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,040
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Are you alright?

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,430
I was so anxious.

196
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,600
How do you feel?

197
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,040
Your Highness. I fell ill out of nowhere

198
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,670
and I'm unsure whether it can be cured.

199
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,430
May Your Highness allow me to live elsewhere.

200
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,840
Don't be stupid.

201
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,910
How can I leave you at a time like this?

202
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,990
Your Highness.

203
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,310
My illness has overcome my body.

204
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,040
If I don't leave the residence,

205
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,670
I'm afraid you and the entire residence
will be infected.

206
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
I don't care about any of that.

207
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
I just want you.

208
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,870
I will follow you in life and death.

209
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,750
I...

210
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,910
Alright. Say no more.

211
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,280
We've been married for so long,

212
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,310
there's no need to make a distinction between
you and me.

213
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,840
Your most important task right now

214
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,840
is to get better.

215
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,720
I'll go heat up your medicine.

216
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,640
You need to have some since you're awake.

217
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,560
(Moral codes for men)

218
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,340
(The seven types of grounds is needed
to get the divorce papers)

219
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,670
Tan.

220
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,080
Turns out

221
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,310
he's pretending to be ill.

222
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,640
What?

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Pretending to be ill?

224
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,910
He wants me to repudiate him.

225
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,080
The secondary prince consort?

226
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,960
Jing Xin.

227
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,230
Why do you think he dislikes me this much?

228
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,990
Am I that unlikeable?

229
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,310
No.

230
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,910
Maybe

231
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,080
the secondary consort has reasons
he cannot speak of.

232
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
I've been treating him so well.

233
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,750
He wants to divorce me?

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,350
Is it possible

235
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,750
that there's someone else?

236
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,870
Someone else?

237
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,080
As in he's having an affair.

238
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,160
Impossible.

239
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,080
He wouldn't dare.

240
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,640
Even if he dares, others wouldn't.

241
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,870
Everyone knows that

242
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
he belongs to Your Highness.

243
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,960
Who dares to challenge you?

244
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,550
That's true.

245
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,310
I have to get it together.

246
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,640
Jing Xin.

247
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,480
If he wants to keep the show going,

248
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,600
we'll have to act our part as well.

249
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,990
Okay.

250
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,310
I will support you in anything you decide to do.

251
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,480
Let's go settle things with Yu Hao.

252
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,840
You're such a great sis!

253
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,790
Let's go.

254
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,080
Let's go.

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,280
Your Highness should go rest.

256
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,790
Having Yu Hao here is enough.

257
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,400
Yu Hao is busy. He doesn't have the time
to take care of you.

258
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,350
I plan to stay here

259
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,990
until you recover.

260
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,520
You...

261
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,110
Your Highness.

262
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,990
Are you asleep?

263
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,270
You don't care if

264
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,880
the illness gets passed on to you?

265
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,150
No, I don't.

266
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
I only care about whether you catch a cold
on top of everything.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,030
Tuck yourself in.

268
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,240
You...

269
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,240
There, I've been infected too.

270
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,360
I'm not leaving.

271
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,790
Look at your cold sweat.

272
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,430
You need to sweat it out.

273
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,880
When did you find out?

274
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,000
I deceived Your Highness.

275
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,760
I don't deserve to be a prince consort.

276
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,000
Your Highness, please repudiate me.

277
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,120
Did you know?

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,510
I'm glad that

279
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,270
you didn't take random medicine in order
to deceive me.

280
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
I know you don't believe me

281
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,630
because you lost your memory.

282
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,080
But I remember everything.

283
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,270
Last time, you traveled to the modern era
to look for me.

284
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,720
This time,

285
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,960
it's my turn to look for you and protect you.

286
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,790
Let's work together

287
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,760
and hurry back to Yu Er,

288
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,310
okay?

289
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,270
You don't even understand what I think,

290
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,910
how can you watch over me?

291
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,790
It is absolutely impossible

292
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,390
for me to repudiate you.

293
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,720
Back then, I left my parents.

294
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,430
More recently, I left Yu Er.

295
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,630
If I have to leave you too,

296
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,510
I wouldn't know how to face tomorrow.

297
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,630

She wasn't concerned about her own safety

344

and kept helping out, right?

345

357
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,240

363
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240

Young Master, why not rethink your decision?

367
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,030
I've made up my mind.

368
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Please.

369
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,960
This way.

370
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,310
Please take a seat.

371
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,080
Qing Zhu. Qing Zhu. Qing Zhu.

372
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,760
What a pretty face.

373
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,310
How come we haven't seen you before?

374
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Everything has a price.

375
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,270
Could you play one more song?

376
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,390
I'll pay for the whole day.

377
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,480
You and I both want to pursue this gentleman,

378
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,550
we should compete fair and square.

379
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,120
You...

380
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,510
- Exactly.
- We should compete fair and square.

381
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,270
- Fair and square.
- Fair and square.

382
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,240
- Fair and square.
- Fair and square.

383
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,310
Our Cheng Cheng is so popular.

384
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,480
It makes me full of pride.

385
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
A fair-and-square competition.

386
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,120
Don't leave, don't leave.

387
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,240
Please leave your name.

388
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Yaju Pavillion needs such a talent as you.

389
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,240
Sir.

390
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,360
Young Master. Shall we call it quits?

391
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,910
Do you also think that I'm without plans and
strategies?

392
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,630
What else are you going to do?

393
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,080
Yaju Pavillion contradicts my nature.

394
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,600
Starting tomorrow,

395
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm going to invite friends over

396
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,910
to the Snow Court with poems
and refined activities.

397
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,080
But where will these friends come from?

398
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,550
This list contains

399
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
the names of many ladies.

400
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,360
Go to visit them one by one,

401
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,630
and they will come for sure.

402
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,880
Young Master, when did you collect these names?

403
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,840
The owner of Yaju Pavillion gave me the list,

404
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,600
saying that they are all regulars.

405
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,480
Inform Her Highness on my behalf.

406
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,510
Just say that starting tomorrow,

407
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,150
I will be inviting female friends...

408
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,960
my mistake...

409
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,910
...many female friends to Snow Court.

410
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,270
I hope that she keeps her promise and
won't stop me.

411
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,910
I have to be the messenger again?

412
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,150
I'll go right away.

413
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,550
What? Inviting homewreckers over?

414
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,910
Many homewreckers?

415
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,790
Tan.

416
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,430
Judging by what Yu Hao said,

417
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,310
the secondary prince consort

418
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
is set on

419
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,510
committing "being wanton".

420
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,840
But in my opinion,

421
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,360
he's probably just testing the waters,

422
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,390
he won't actually follow through.

423
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,000
Besides, you won't agree to it.

424
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,080
I will. Why won't I?

425
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,960
The worst thing

426
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,270
is not knowing who the other women are.

427
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,670
I can take this opportunity

428
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,600
to catch all the women who are interested

429
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,120
in Mo Lian Cheng in one go.

430
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,840
But this will be bad

431
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,790
for the Princess's Residence's reputation.

432
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,790
What do we do if

433
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,600
those in the Palace find out and punish us for it?

434
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,760
I know Mo Lian Cheng too well.

435
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,960
He's stubborn.

436
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,720
He won't stop until he gets what he wants.

437
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,760
I'll take care of those in the Palace.

438
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
It's just a book club.

439
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,360
It won't be a big deal

440
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,720
if the invitations are under my name.

441
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,550
But, Tan,

442
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,120
I'm scared...

443
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,270
True warriors

444
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,310
dare to face their opponents head-on.

445
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,670
Don't worry.

446
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,910
Besides, I have a Plan B.

447
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,600
What B?

448
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,270
It's...

449
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,670
She really agreed to it?

450
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,510
Yes.

451
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,720
Eighth Brother.

452
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,430
Just now, Tan Er sent someone over to inform me

453
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,790
that the entire residence will be entertaining
your female guests tomorrow.

454
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,960
Is this true?

455
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,480
If it is,

456
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,030
I advise you to proceed with caution.

457
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,240
I heard about what happened at Yaju Pavillion.

458
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,200
The Palace and the Mo Residence will catch wind
of it as well.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,960
Let's give the matter

460
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,550
of the divorce papers a further thought.

461
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,600
Eldest Brother, I understand your concerns.

462
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,910
However, what's done cannot be undone.

463
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,360
We've already come this far.

464
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,790
Please help me leave as soon as possible.

465
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,360
This way, please.

466
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,200
I've never seen someone so good-looking.

467
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,840
Young Master,
why don't you think it through once more?

468
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,910
Help me sort out my robes.

469
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,150
The weather is great today.

470
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,840
It's my pleasure to have everyone over at Snow Court
to appreciate poems.

471
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,240
I'm going to share a new Ci.
[*A type of lyric poetry in classical Chinese poetry]

472
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,480
Brows in a curving style, the yellow
shadow on her forehead is hard to tell.

473
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,760
The hairs on her temples appear—
as clouds which, against her cheeks, so fair.

474
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,390
Speaking of women's make-up.

475
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,480
Although it is said that men dress up for those
who love them,

476
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,390
but there isn't a woman who doesn't wish for

477
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,910
great skin and a beautiful face,

478
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,200
right?

479
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,360
Greetings, Second Princess.

480
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,670
No need to be so formal.

481
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,790
Sit.

482
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,670
To thank you for accepting
the prince consort's invitation,

483
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
I've prepared a small gift

484
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,310
for everyone.

485
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,790
Jing Xin.

486
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Just a little gift.

487
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,200
This is related to

488
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,720
the poem the prince consort just recited.

489
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,550
Who doesn't want snow-like skin?

490
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,880
Then we must mention

491
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,270
the brow powder I'm holding.

492
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,000
Its scent is very unique.

493
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,030
This is a secret formula of the royal family.

494
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,310
And the Princess's Residence's
special rouge.

495
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,840
After putting on both,

496
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,880
you will look like

497
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,390
the loveliest peach.

498
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,600
And I guarantee that

499
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,880
your make-up will stay on for 24 hours.

500
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,670
Its texture is amazing.

501
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,000
Better than what I bought from Daichunlin

502
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,720
a few days ago.

503
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,840
Fate has brought us together.

504
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,630
How about this?

505
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,480
If you register with Jing Xin,

506
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,430
I promise to

507
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,550
only charge for the raw materials

508
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,630
and the products will be delivered directly
to your residences.

509
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,760
- That's great.
- Great.

510
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,030
Let's go to register.

511
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,150
There's no need to rush.

512
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,840
Everyone will get their own.

513
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,150
Please continue appreciating poems,

514
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,720
continue.

515
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,960
Slowly she rises from her bed and paints her brows.

516
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,760
She takes her time, unhurried,
to complete her makeup.

517
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,590
Her beauty is reflected between two mirrors.

518
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,390
Her...

519
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,590
Natural make-up doesn't include
painting on brows.

520
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,070
But in my opinion,

521
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,110
there is quite a lot to eyebrow make-up.

522
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,720
The highest level

523
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,590
would be looking like you haven't put on
eyebrow make-up while you actually did.

524
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,150
Take a look.

525
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,560
Don't my eyebrows look fluffy?

526
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,480
With Chinese knotweed extract inside,

527
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,200
it is definitely a luxurious treat for
your eyebrows.

528
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,630
It's true.

529
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,670
Her Highness's eyebrows are indeed
a work of art.

530
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,480
Just pick it up!

531
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,520
Since we're sharing,

532
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,670
I'll go all out.

533
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,150
The best deal is coming up.

534
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
My next recommendation

535
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,630
is this lip rouge.

536
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,720
Let me try it for everyone.

537
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,430
Look.

538
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,200
Look at this exquisite texture.

539
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,070
- What is this?
- This unique scent.

540
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,800
It really brightens up the complexion.

541
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,280
Oh my god.

542
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,390
This is the scent of a noblewoman.

543
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,390
My heart beats for it.

544
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,760
We can switch out our men,

545
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,560
but our lip colour must stay the same.

546
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,760
What are you waiting for? Let's get it!

547
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,150
- Me!
- Me, too!

548
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,560
Ten! I want ten!

549
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,590
I want fifteen!

550
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,720
I'll take thirty!

551
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,390
Leave one for me!

552
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,430
Yu...

553
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,350
The one used on the fourteenth young master.

554
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,870
Fine.

555
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,910
Yes!

556
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,760
Mo Lian Cheng has committed the seven types
of grounds

557
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,070
and wants to receive divorce papers.

558
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,000
However, Qu Tan Er doesn't seem to mind
and has not made any moves.

559
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,800
The seven types of grounds?

560
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,760
This is definitely not something

561
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,480
the original eighth young master of the Mo family
would do.

562
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,720
Asking for repudiation papers is indeed puzzling.

563
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,630
Go.

564
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Find out everything you can about
this Mo Lian Cheng.

565
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:54,830
Yes.

566
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,430
(Mo Residence)
Mo Lian Cheng acts recklessly and suspiciously.

567
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:10,960
(Mo Residence)

568
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,070
He is asking for divorce papers and
wants to leave the Princess's Residence.

569
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,240
Could it be...

570
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,720
Lian Cheng's actions have put us in
a difficult position.

571
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,720
I will make sure to inquire about it.

572
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,110
Please focus on the big picture,

573
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,000
don't let this divert your attention.

574
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,430
Mr. Mo, this is a serious matter.

575
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,870
If there is no backup,

576
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,630
what insurance do my righteous troops have?

577
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,800
Besides, it is impossible
for the empress not to notice.

578
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,590
Patience.

579
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Under the empress's orders,

580
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,070
Xiao Zhen has increased the tax rates

581
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,720
for farmers of the four counties of Jingdu
once again.

582
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,630
In a country where its people are suffering,

583
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,350
we should act as one

584
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,870
and not blame each other.

585
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,870
My son is just a pawn

586
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,040
in this grand scheme.

587
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,110
I know what to do.

588
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,240
Okay, I believe you.

589
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,150
I'll be leaving now. Goodbye.

590
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,070
Alright.

591
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:27,520
Making sales is easy for me, the queen of realtors.

592
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,480
Cheng Cheng underestimated me.

593
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,910
But I have to thank him.

594
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,480
It's you.

595
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,480
You scared me.

596
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,280
You came at the right time.

597
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,240
Prince Consort, you made great contributions
to the sales.

598
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,800
Don't worry.

599
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,070
I'll be giving out dividends periodically.

600
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,110
How about

601
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,630
toasting to our success?

602
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,320
Your Highness is of high social status,

603
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,960
there is no need for you to make a living
out of selling make-up.

604
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,000
Aren't you afraid of

605
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,590
giving others leverage on you?

606
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,240
What's wrong with me earning my own living

607
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,070
with my own skills?

608
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,110
You, on the other hand,

609
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,590
have committed "being wanton" repeatedly.

610
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,760
Are you not afraid of giving others leverage on you?

611
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,910
Your Highness,

612
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,390
I want to...

613
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,200
Do you have

614
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,800
a favour to ask of me?

615
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,830
If you want to ask for a favour,
you should be mindful of your attitude,

616
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,830
shouldn't you?

617
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,830
(Divorce Paper)

618
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,150
Divorce paper?

619
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,870
Your Highness, please consent to my wishes

620
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,390
and allow me to leave the residence as soon
as possible.

621
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,110
Okay.

622
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,110
Okay?

623
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Why didn't...

624
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,040
No...

625
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,350
Are you

626
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,000
saying yes?

627
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,240
I am.

628
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,480
However, I had asked you for divorce papers
as well.

629
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,480
This time, we need to do things the same way
as before.

630
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,590
If this is the case,

631
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,560
so be it.

632
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,830
I am not someone who betrays others.

633
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,630
I won't impose on others what I do not desire.

634
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,070
This last time,

635
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,560
we'll do things your way.

636
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,960
Okay.

637
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,800
A promise is a promise.

638
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,630
Come on.

639
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,430
What is the meaning of this?

640
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,320
Sleep with me.

641
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,040
If I'm satisfied,

642
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,480
you can have the divorce papers.
