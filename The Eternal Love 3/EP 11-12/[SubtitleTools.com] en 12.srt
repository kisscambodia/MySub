00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,870
To celebrate our anniversary,

17
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,390
cheers.

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,920
Cheers.

19
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,800
I even prepared presents for you.

20
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,820
(Have you decided yet?)

21
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,360
"Have you decided yet?"

22
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,920
To decide on what?

23
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,160
This is one way to display affection.

24
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,160
Have you...

25
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,080
decided yet?

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,750
(She is using the repudiation paper)

27
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,390
(as leverage.)

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,560
Have you decided, Prince Consort?

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,920
Have you decided yet?

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,720
In her dream!

31
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,590
(Have you decided yet, Prince Consort?)

32
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,640
What?

33
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,750
Nothing.

34
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
No.

35
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,640
Have some tea.

36
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,670
Have some tea, Young Master.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,720
(Does she think I'm like other men, that I would)

38
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,560
(give in as long as I'm threatened)

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,080
(with my reputation?)

40
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,440
Eighth Brother.

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,590
Why do you look so absent-minded?

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,590
He's been spaced out recently.

43
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,920
Nosy.

44
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,560
The thing you said you need to do yesterday.

45
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,440
You didn't do it after all, did you?

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,030
Yu Hao!

47
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,400
You're being nosy again.

48
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm not.

49
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,990
So you've already asked for
the repudiation paper?

50
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
But you didn't pack your belongings
or leave Princess' Residence.

51
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,840
Her Highness must haven't agreed, right?

52
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,750
Not really.

53
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
What is it then?

54
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,990
Eighth Brother, what is it?

55
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,030
Her Highness asked,

56
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,710
"Have you decided yet?"

57
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,520
I keep hearing that line in the manor.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm curious too.

59
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,800
What is it that you should decide?

60
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,430
Don't you have better things to do?

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,150
Curiosity killed the cat.

62
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,120
Fourteenth.

63
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,310
Why are you here every day?

64
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,550
I'm definitely not here for Jing Xin.

65
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,550
I...

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,120
I...

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm here because I care about you.

68
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,840
What exactly is going on with
your repudiation paper?

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,310
It is a test.

70
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,310
If I pass, I can get the paper.

71
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,080
Is it hard?

72
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,750
So you can't pass it.

73
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,680
Of course not!

74
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,270
It's so easy that I can pass in an instant.

75
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,750
You never wanted to get that paper,

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,430
which is why you're so frustrated.

77
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,120
In this world we live in,

78
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,640
no man would voluntarily give up
their happiness.

79
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,800
Who says marriage means happiness

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,200
and being disowned means misery?

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
Everyone knows that

82
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,400
being disowned means misery.

83
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,800
Not to mention Her Highness thinks
so highly of you.

84
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,800
This isn't right.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Her Highness set a test that is easy to pass

86
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,870
as a condition to disown you.

87
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,200
I think

88
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,800
Her Highness doesn't think highly of you.

89
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,150
(She keeps urging me to make a decision.)

90
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,990
(It does seem like she's in a hurry to chase me out.)

91
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
(In that case, I shall fulfill her wish.)

92
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,750
Jing Xin.

93
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,400
Tell Her Highness that

94
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,120
I've made up my mind.

95
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,400
Really?

96
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,870
He agreed?

97
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,710
Who would have thought?

98
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,400
We're married for so long,

99
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,750
but I'm still so touched by his action.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,590
Jing Xin, get the bathwater ready for me.

101
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,590
Put some petals into it.

102
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,870
Light some incenses too.

103
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,590
I should get sexy pajamas for the night too.

104
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,150
Should I get a new hairstyle as well?

105
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,960
Tan. Before bedtime,

106
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,470
only the man should dress up

107
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
and clean his body.

108
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,870
Why are you the one who's worried?

109
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,310
You're right.

110
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
It's not every day

111
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,030
Mo Lian Cheng would take the initiative.

112
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,080
I should act cold.

113
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,710
I'll stay put and wait.

114
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,520
I'll be ready for him once he's all set.

115
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,360
But...

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,920
are you really going to disown him

117
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
after the night together?

118
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,590
You'll find out soon enough.

119
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,080
I have no idea

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,870
what kind of challenge Second Princess
is asking you to have,

121
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,080
but the way I see it,

122
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,030
you will never falter.

123
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,240
Falter?

124
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,030
If it were you, you would have lost.

125
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,710
If I were you,

126
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,750
I would face the same predicament.

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,080
The world is too harsh for men.

128
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,840
If you want to give up now,

129
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,990
I will never look down on you.

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,640
Never.

131
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,230
Her Highness keeps pushing me now

132
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,080
only to make me give up.

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,600
But I will never surrender.

134
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,960
What exactly is this challenge

135
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,750
that makes you so worried?

136
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,640
It's a long struggle of mind and strength.

137
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
It requires your strength?

138
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,520
So that's what the swordplay training for.

139
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,430
I have faith in you.

140
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,870
Go.

141
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,430
No eavesdropping!

142
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,200
But...

143
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,550
I said, no eavesdropping!

144
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,990
What is this challenge?

145
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,040
Just tell me.

146
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,600
That is not possible.

147
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,110
All you need to know

148
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,870
is that all men fear it.

149
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,870
That's all.

150
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,750
Is it so terrifying?

151
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,480
Are you scared already?

152
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,310
Scaredy cat.

153
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm not afraid!

154
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,110
If you use it to challenge me,

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,990
I'll definitely not be nervous.

156
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,790
I'm not challenging you!

157
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,310
Why do you keep coming here?

158
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,200
It's late and you should leave.

159
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
Otherwise, you'll get a lecture.

160
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,430
Go.

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,310
But...

162
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,080
Just go.

163
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,350
Go on.

164
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,750
It's such a beautiful night.

165
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,640
What is taking him so long?

166
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,750
Curse that Mo Lian Cheng.

167
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,110
Is he backing out?

168
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,550
You'll pay dearly for this.

169
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,350
Princess.

170
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,400
Princess?

171
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,080
The candle just went out.

172
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,310
How can you fall asleep so quickly?

173
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,350
Could it be...

174
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,960
that Your Highness is nervous?

175
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
Who is this nuisance?

176
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Why are you hitting me?

177
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Open your eyes and look at me.

178
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,310
Don't run away.

179
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,310
(My goodness. How bossy.)

180
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,480
(He's finally come around after
drinking some wines?)

181
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,350
Perhaps...

182
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,230
Your Highness is shy.

183
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,310
There is no need to punish yourself.

184
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,430
Eighth Young Master was reckless.

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,350
It wasn't your fault.

186
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,110
I understand the purpose.

187
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,790
Yet, I chose to do nothing.

188
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,280
I even hope for his plan to succeed.

189
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,840
I deserve this punishment.

190
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,310
You and Her Highness were childhood friends.

191
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,350
People in love are selfish.

192
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,640
It's normal for anyone.

193
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,990
Once,

194
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,110
I mocked those men who had become

195
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,790
calculating and shallow because of love.

196
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
But now,

197
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,670
I'm just like them.

198
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,900
(The slightest negligence of kindness
makes way for the darkness.)

199
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,230
(Is it all over now?)

200
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,990
(I shouldn't have drunk so much.)

201
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,870
(This is the last time we share this bed.)

202
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,230
(But you're sleeping as if you don't know any of it.)

203
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,670
(That's good anyway.)

204
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,670
(Since you're oblivious to it,)

205
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,080
(it's easier for me to let go.)

206
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,990
(You're so reluctant to part ways.)

207
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,280
(My charm must be overwhelming.)

208
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,720
(I should mess with him a little.)

209
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,230
Did you have enough fun?

210
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,200
I fulfilled the agreement.

211
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,960
It's your turn now.

212
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,280
Help me get changed.

213
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
We are no longer husband and wife.

214
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,550
You have no right over me.

215
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,200
Very well.

216
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
Suit yourself.

217
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,640
Where is the repudiation paper?

218
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,630
I wasn't satisfied.

219
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,030
You...

220
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,670
She wasn't satisfied?

221
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,430
Young Master, it's time for your meal.

222
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,360
Eighth Brother!

223
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,790
Eighth Brother, there are rumors everywhere!

224
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Aren't you going to do anything?

225
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,150
What rumors?

226
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,880
Well...

227
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,790
The Mo family knows

228
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,030
you've left Her Highness unsatisfied.

229
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,960
Even the Mo family knows it.

230
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,790
Judging by your look...

231
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,790
The rumors are true?

232
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,240
This is bad.

233
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,000
The son-in-law of the Minister of War
was considered a letdown.

234
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,480
He lost the slightest respect in the family
within three days.

235
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Not to mention the concubine of
Princess of Qian Yue

236
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,630
was considered a letdown

237
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,480
and got...

238
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,430
I have a goal

239
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,120
and there is no shortcut to it.

240
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,150
Prince Consort.

241
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,270
This is the tonic soup I was asked
to send to you.

242
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,550
Get rid of these!

243
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,200
Check out this beautiful bracelet!

244
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,390
Have a look around!

245
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,080
Check out our fabrics!

246
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,360
Check out our fabrics.

247
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,480
Your Highness!

248
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,430
Look at this fabric.

249
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,430
Lady.

250
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,030
This is too bright.

251
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,080
Check out ours.

252
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
- How about this?
- Have a look.

253
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,720
It's too plain.

254
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,200
Lady, what about this?

255
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,480
We have the finest goods.

256
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,200
These are all quality goods from Jiangnan.

257
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Please have another look!

258
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,630
This lady matches that of a goddess.

259
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,310
Your elegance and grace are enchanting.

260
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,600
Your beauty is beyond any words.

261
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,910
At least you're not blind.

262
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
- Don't you know she is...
- Mi Xue.

263
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,270
This is an anonymous trip.

264
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,630
Be discreet.

265
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,630
Yes, Eldest Princess.

266
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,840
Pardon my ignorance.

267
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,510
The rumors about your beauty are true.

268
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,200
Your Highness's charm

269
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,960
outshines even the most radiant gems!

270
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,310
How about a handkerchief?

271
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,430
Your Highness.

272
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,960
Colorful fabrics!

273
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,500
(Fragrance sachet)

274
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,510
Feel free to browse our merchandise!

275
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,430
Young Master, you have great taste.

276
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,000
With the fragrance sachet,

277
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,670
the couple will thrive in harmony!

278
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,270
Here, have a look.

279
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,430
Very well. I'll have one.

280
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,480
I hope this fragrance sachet will remind
Tan Er of the past.

281
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,030
Eldest Princess.

282
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,150
Remembering the past?

283
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,880
Is it worth it to stoop so low for her?

284
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,270
Please be mindful of your words.

285
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,390
She is your sister and my wife.

286
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,550
The whole city knows

287
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,310
her attitude towards Mo Lian Cheng.

288
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,030
Do you also want dissatisfaction?

289
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,510
Please don't believe the rumors.

290
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,310
It's a fact.

291
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,790
I'm reminding you out of pity.

292
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
Since you only slander her name,

293
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,670
I won't argue with you.

294
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,390
Why can't you open your eyes?

295
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,390
She doesn't care about you.

296
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Otherwise,

297
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,150
she wouldn't ignore your pain

298
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,720
or make you suffer in silence.

299
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,270
Yes.

300
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,910
I'm blinded by the pain.

301
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,150
I can't see the truth.

302
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,310
But Your Highness,

303
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,880
are you any different?

304
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,480
I'll take my leave.

305
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,000
Serve me in my chamber.

306
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,100
(Have you decided yet?)

307
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,120
(Have you...)

308
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
(decided yet?)

309
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,670
(Would the outcome be any different
if I had not been drunk?)

310
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,030
Who would have thought?

311
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,080
The word "unsatisfied" would be this powerful.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,270
I should have made the word our family motto.

313
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,880
Jing Xin, grind the ink.

314
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,620
(Keep working)

315
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,670
Tan.

316
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,310
Is this calligraphy for Prince Consort again?

317
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,310
I want him to frame it

318
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,430
and hang it above his bedhead.

319
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Where there is a will, there is a way.

320
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,910
But he already went through a lot today.

321
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
At this rate...

322
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,200
You don't get it.

323
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,030
He loves going against me.

324
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,550
But he's a man.

325
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,000
He has a delicate heart.

326
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,840
If he really takes it to heart,

327
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,910
it will be a great loss!

328
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
He's a tough one.

329
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,670
He's no ordinary man.

330
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,430
I'm not going to send this to him this time.

331
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,880
(I wasn't satisfied.)

332
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,000
No.

333
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,880
If I wasn't drunk,

334
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,310
I would never end up like this.

335
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,030
No.

336
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,120
Satisfied?

337
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,480
I don't care. Why should I be bothered?

338
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,760
Remembering the past?

339
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,180
Is it worth it to stoop so low

340
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,390
for her?

341
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,760
The whole city knows

342
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,120
her attitude towards Mo Lian Cheng.

343
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,270
Do you also want dissatisfaction?

344
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,390
You won't blame me.

345
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,550
But I blame myself.

346
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,790
I don't want to stay at this manor anymore.

347
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,390
If you refuse to help me...

348
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,760
I shall do it myself.

349
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,390
I hope you could help me leave this place.

350
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,600
(He was so determined to get the repudiation paper.)

351
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,910
(But now he served her in the chamber.)

352
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,760
Could it be the reason he asked for
the repudiation paper

353
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,790
is that he's afraid he and the Mo family would
involve Tan Er in trouble in the future?

354
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,240
Vent your frustration on me if you want.

(that I insisted on leaving,)

366
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,960
(so she wouldn't be in danger.)

367
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,910
(I must get the repudiation paper tonight.)

368
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,270
Young Master.

369
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,550
Young Master, your face...

370
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,840
You don't need to serve me tonight.

371
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,430
Lock me inside the room.

372
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,200
Open it at this hour tomorrow.

373
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,910
What about your meals?

374
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,240
I need nothing.

375
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,720
Young Master. Is this necessary?

376
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,670
I violated the code of man, I deserve punishment!

377
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,600
Leave.

378
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,720
Humans...

379
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,960
are hard to understand.

380
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,630
A step forward brings glory.

381
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,510
A step backward...

382
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
will send a man to darkness.

383
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,880
Are you drunk again?

384
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,080
Unsatisfied.

385
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,600
That's the most powerful word in this world.

386
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,790
If it weren't for you,

387
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,840
this headache...

388
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
might have cost me my life one day.

389
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,720
We need to cure the root of this sickness.

390
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,840
Your Majesty's condition has become worse.

391
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,670
Perhaps breaking the taboo was the cause.

392
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,550
He's the cause of this sickness.

393
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,720
A little pain is worth it.

394
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,120
Did he get the repudiation paper?

395
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,760
No.

396
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,150
But there are rumors.

397
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,720
They say Eighth Young Master of the Mo family

398
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,120
left Her Highness unsatisfied.

399
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,120
Unsatisfied?

400
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,390
Perhaps...

401
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,430
Her Highness found out Eighth Young Master
was using her,

402
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
so she spread rumors to tarnish his name.

403
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,240
It's a punishment.

404
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,600
Judging by that...

405
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,200
Such actions

406
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
do not fit Tan Er's personality.

407
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,240
Is Your Majesty suspecting

408
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,310
something is amiss?

409
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,910
Summon him to the palace.

410
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,790
Your Majesty.

411
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,150
I need confirmation.

412
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,670
Yes.

413
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,510
Don't you have anything to say?

414
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,030
Nothing. What should I say?

415
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,030
So you weren't unsatisfied.

416
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,720
You were messing with me!

417
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,630
I said before that everyone was born equal.

418
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,120
Why a woman can disown her husband,

419
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,840
but a man can't disown his wife?

420
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,310
Men can disown their wives.

421
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,880
You...

422
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,000
Then allow me to disown you.

423
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,310
Disown me?

424
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,360
Did you wake me up just for that?

425
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,600
I made the same request so many times.

426
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,080
Did you ever listen?

427
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,880
You...

428
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,510
Princess.

429
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,960
Her Majesty summoned Secondary Prince Consort.

430
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,760
From what I heard,

431
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,270
Second Princess's Residence
has been very lively.

432
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,910
What does Your Majesty mean?

433
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Do you not know?

434
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,360
If it's because I violated the seven
types of grounds

435
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,390
and moral codes for men many times,

436
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,910
please punish me, Your Majesty.

437
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,550
Second Princess is of the royal bloodline.

438
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,200
Breaking the seven grounds is a serious crime.

439
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,310
Her actions and behaviors will serve
as examples for the people.

440
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,760
You should behave yourself.

441
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
Pardon my intrusion.

442
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,390
Marriage involves both men and women.

443
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,910
Who only women have the right
to decide everything?

444
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,670
It seems like Second Princess's Residence

445
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,790
is more distasteful than I had imagined.

446
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
If all men can't get their repudiation papers,

447
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,720
breaking the seven grounds is the only way.

448
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,080
Your Majesty,

449
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,120
how should they be punished?

450
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,910
Do you really think all men

451
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,150
are the same as you,

452
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,030
that they would act rashly just to get disowned?

453
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,430
Your Majesty!

454
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,030
If all women in the country

455
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,910
neglect the men's willingness,

456
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,030
refuse to disown their husbands despite
breaking the seven grounds,

457
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,510
what will happen to this country?

458
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,630
Insolence!

459
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,840
Kneel outside the main hall and reflect yourself!

460
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,320
Your Majesty.

461
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,870
The way he speaks...

462
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,670
was just like that man.

463
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,350
But as Your Majesty said,

464
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
there would be no other man like him.

465
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,800
He showed wisdom in his words

466
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,430
and showed no fear in his speech.

467
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,390
He is no longer

468
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,800
the same man he used to be.

469
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,910
Secondary Prince Consort does have
become different over time.

470
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,830
It's more than that.

471
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,350
It's like he's been reborn!

472
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,480
I await Your Majesty's order.

473
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,040
Since he wants to leave,

474
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,110
I cannot ignore his request.

475
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,430
How long can the lotus survive

476
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,910
out of water?

477
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,040
No matter how long,

478
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,800
it made the decision.

479
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,630
There shall be no regret.

480
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,070
Tell me.

481
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,070
How badly do you want to leave?

482
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,760
Even the shortest freedom

483
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,150
is better than living in a cage

484
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,000
which brings only suffering.

485
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,760
So the Second Princess's Residence

486
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,590
is only a cage to you.

487
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,480
In that case,

488
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,480
I'll announce a new law.

489
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,910
Every man will have the right to end a marriage.

490
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,320
It will be implemented in the capital first.

491
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,280
We'll observe the effect.

492
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,910
Your Majesty is wise.

493
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,870
Since you've made up your mind,

494
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,760
you could make the request now

495
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,630
and become the pioneer of this law.

496
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,430
(Tan Er, I'm sorry.)

497
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,590
(I can't put you in harm's way.)

498
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,590
(Not anymore.)

499
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,390
(Tan Er, I'm sorry.)

500
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,830
(I can't protect you anymore.)

501
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,320
(I can no longer protect you.)

502
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,350
(I can no longer protect you.)

503
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,070
I am grateful to Your Majesty.

504
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,040
I'm aware of my duty,

505
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,480
so I must not act rashly.

506
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,110
What do you mean?

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,560
Your Majesty's wise policies have
earned people's respect.

508
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,830
People should use it with caution.

509
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,870
Second Princess and I serve
as role models for the people.

510
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,430
We cannot act recklessly.

511
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,350
So

512
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,320
you don't plan to make use of this new law.

513
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,830
Flowers will lose their brilliance eventually.

514
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,390
Marriage is the same.

515
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,520
If one celebrates the wonders
and neglects the hardships,

516
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
a marriage won't last.

517
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,910
I should work with Second Princess

518
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,830
in this difficult time,

519
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,280
so Your majesty's effort won't go in vain.

520
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,070
You looked so determined.

521
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,760
Was it just a trick?

522
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
I wouldn't dare.

523
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,720
I came to a realization while kneeling.

524
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,280
I thought my impulsive behavior

525
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,590
would get me punished.

526
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,040
But Your Majesty showed me mercy.

527
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,480
I've come to regret my action deeply.

528
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,870
If you ever act on impulse again,

529
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,670
I will not show any mercy.

530
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm grateful, Your Majesty.

531
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,040
If we lose track of the lead now,

532
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,520
it will make future investigations difficult.

533
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,280
Your Majesty, allow me to investigate.

534
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,040
Listen.

535
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,910
He defied Her Majesty in the palace.

536
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,070
Her Majesty?

537
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,480
For real?

538
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,800
(My Cheng Cheng must be back!)

539
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,480
My Cheng Cheng never disappoints me.

540
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,760
All right. Very well.

541
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,720
You can get to work.

542
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,870
Cheng Cheng.

543
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,390
Mo Lian Cheng.

544
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,720
How bold of you!

545
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,430
How dare you trick Her Majesty!

546
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,590
Jing Xin told me about it.

547
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,350
She knows everything

548
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,480
going on in the palace.

549
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,960
Your turning happened at the right timing.

550
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,590
I think Jing Xin is not the only one

551
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,070
capable of spreading gossips.

552
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,000
All right. I have a lot to say to you.

553
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,110
Go to my room with me.

554
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,720
Promise me.

555
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,960
Whatever I do when the amnesia kicks in,

556
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,560
do not divorce me.

557
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,870
Certainly.

558
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,520
You haven't satisfied me yet.

559
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,390
You...

560
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,350
You should be more cautious.

561
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,390
Otherwise,

562
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,350
I might get amnesia again.

563
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,390
If you can't touch me,

564
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,760
how can I be satisfied?

565
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,670
I can't touch you.

566
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,350
But this thing will do.

567
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,000
Give it back!

568
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,560
