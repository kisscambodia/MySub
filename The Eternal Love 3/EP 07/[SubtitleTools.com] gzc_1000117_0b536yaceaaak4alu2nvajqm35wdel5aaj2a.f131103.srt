16
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,900
Where is the imperial token?

17
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,180
I pawned it.

18
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,020
When the Yin and Yang pieces
of the imperial token are combined,

19
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,860
it can be used to command the armies.

20
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,220
How could you just pawn it?

21
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,410
If you wanted the imperial token,
you could've asked me directly.

22
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,020
Why did you have to use tricks?

23
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,130
If I asked you for it, would you have given it to me?

24
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,220
No.

25
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Because I'm not stupid.

26
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,970
I know what the imperial token is.

27
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
And I know that

28
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,300
pawning it as if I knew nothing

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,740
is the best choice.

30
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,130
Because someone else had once

31
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,970
used the imperial token to test me before.

32
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,100
Aside from the Empress,

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,020
who else dared to test you
using the imperial token?

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,690
Someone who is before my eyes

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,970
yet I cannot meet.

36
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,300
Before your eyes?

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,770
Starting from the Xuanling Continent,

38
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,380
he and I have had our fates

39
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,170
entangled together through several
parallel universes.

40
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,500
Each time, we had to start over.

41
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,130
People only experience

42
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,250
pain and happiness

43
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,660
once in their lives.

44
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,610
However, he and I

45
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,890
loved more than once

46
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,690
and got hurt more than once.

47
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,530
Xuanling Continent.

48
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,020
Several parallel universes?

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,100
Your Highness, when you lie,

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,770
you should choose a better story to tell.

51
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,970
I'm not the princess.

52
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,890
I'm not Qu Tan Er either.

53
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,580
I haven't been since I met you
during the harem selection.

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,690
You're not Qu Tan Er?

55
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,690
Then who are you?

56
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,860
Where did Qu Tan Er go?

57
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,460
It looks like

58
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
there is no chance for me to meet her this time.

59
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,010
You only need to remember that I'm Qu Tan.

60
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,540
I'm from another Dongyue.

61
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,450
You won't believe what I said.

62
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,100
You might think I'm making everything up.

63
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,540
However, the person I love

64
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,450
has the same appearance

65
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,420
and the same name as you.

66
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,730
He is in your body.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,010
I insisted on marrying you.

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,730
It's not for you,

69
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,820
but for always staying by his side.

70
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,050
Her behaviour indicates

71
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,420
she is acting like a different person

72
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,140
rather than having a change in temperament.

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,050
Is there another me in my body?

74
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,010
A person who she truly loves?

75
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,980
Did she really pawn the imperial token?

76
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,540
Exactly.

77
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,540
This Qu Tan Er doesn't act

78
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,700
as I would expect.

79
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,220
This way,

80
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,380
she proves she has no interest
in the imperial token

81
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,380
and also made it impossible for Mo Lian Cheng
to get the imperial token.

82
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,010
However, she also gave up

83
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,820
the power of the imperial token.

84
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,290
So I think

85
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,050
Qu Tan Er doesn't trust Mo Lian Cheng.

86
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,770
She is also afraid that the Mo Family will use her
to do something.

87
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,850
She would rather give up the imperial token

88
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,260
than being manipulated.

89
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,100
Could it be that

90
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,260
they are really faking it?

91
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,610
If that's true,

92
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,820
why would she insist on marrying Mo Lian Cheng?

93
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,980
It's a deal.

94
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
No matter what it is,

95
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,660
it's only a waste of effort.

96
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,570
We only need to wait for Tianji to come.

97
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,980
Has the timing of Tianji

98
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,050
been calculated?

99
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,260
We need three more months.

100
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,700
To be safe,

101
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,450
get her to make preparations for
my grand ceremony early.

102
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,220
There must be no flaws.

103
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,850
So that's why I'd suddenly

105
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,170
forgot what I was doing.

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,290
Was he also the one being intimate with you?

107
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Is everything you've done for him?

108
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,850
Are you surprised?

109
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,660
Do you care?

110
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,980
He never let me feel

111
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,660
that this is just a suffering dream of mine.

112
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,330
He makes me understand

113
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,770
I'm the most important person in his heart.

114
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,980
You?

115
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,500
It doesn't matter.

116
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,730
I don't care.

117
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,500
If you don't care,

118
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,450
why did you stop me?

119
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,890
I don't care about you,

120
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,010
but I care about him.

121
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,770
I don't care if

122
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,330
you steal the imperial token

123
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,850
or if the Mo Family wants to rebel.

124
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,290
I could've happily

125
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,610
helped you marry into the harem.

126
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,170
But he is still here.

127
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,010
Sometimes,

128
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,010
I subconsciously

129
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,260
think that you are him.

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,420
That's my mistake.

131
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,220
I'll make sure to remember that you are not him.

132
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,100
After we get you two to separate,

133
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,220
it'll be none of my business

134
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,450
even if you cause huge problems.

135
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,850
But now,

136
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,980
if you do anything that

137
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,540
will put him in danger,

138
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,570
I won't allow it as I had before.

139
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,050
Wait.

140
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,290
If everything you said just now

141
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,330
is true,

142
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,500
then why did you give me leverage？

143
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,220
Aren't you afraid that I'll expose you?

144
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,610
In your eyes,

145
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,970
aren't we using each other for our own benefits?

146
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,170
We both have leverage on the other,

147
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,260
isn't that good?

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,340
are not done with true feelings.

152
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,210

in broad daylight

156
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,460
and find out that this has all been a dream
when I wake up.

157
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,530
Yan Chen?

158
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,500
Tan Er?

159
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,260
That wine bottle is empty.

160
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,850
I went to get another one.

161
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,500
It seems like

162
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,850
I haven't just sat down and talked to him.

163
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,260
My current situation

164
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,900
is rather similar to his.

165
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,380
You came at the right time.

166
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
We didn't fully enjoy ourselves by the lake.

167
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,140
How about having a picnic?

168
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,780
A picnic?

169
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,820
Tell me,

170
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
if the person you love changed

171
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,020
into another person

172
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,170
who you can't tell if it's that one for real.

173
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,170
But you can't change the situation.

174
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,380
What should you do?

175
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,610
Tan Er is Tan Er.

176
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,610
If you changed, I can't undo it,

177
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,530
but I'd love you with my instinct.

178
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,500
There is no way.

179
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,730
Everyone said you changed and went crazy

180
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,170
after falling into the water.

181
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,090
However, I'd never forgotten about

182
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,650
the affection we had for one another.

183
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,780
Everyone said

184
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,090
you went crazy,

185
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,970
but it seems that

186
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,730
you never forgot about the affection
we have for one another.

187
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,900
Why did I...?

188
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,940
Eighth Brother.

189
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,460
You...

190
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,460
I...

191
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,340
I...

192
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,730
I...

193
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,500
This...

194
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,580
Family members help each other.

195
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,580
Being together

196
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,410
feels nice.

197
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,340
Is it possible that

198
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,850
the one I just kissed was Cheng Cheng?

199
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,850
It can't be.

200
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,170
Given how disgusted he looked afterwards,

201
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,610
that was Eighth Young Master for sure.

202
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,820
Did you and the secondary prince consort

203
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,700
do that?

204
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,780
Aren't you an emotionless guard?

205
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,380
Finally exposing your gossipy nature?

206
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,730
I care about Your Highness.

207
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,650
But whenever Cheng Cheng comes out,

208
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,290
there is no disconnect in his memories.

209
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
That's strange.

210
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,610
When Tan Er and I used to switch,

211
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,530
we didn't remember what the other had done.

212
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,820
There is another possibility.

213
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,820
Cheng Cheng has been the same person
from the beginning,

214
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,780
not two souls in one body.

215
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,210
Then why does he recognize me sometimes

216
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,780
but doesn't at other times?

217
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,500
It sounds like Secondary Prince Consort

218
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,260
is suffering from amnesia.

219
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,730
Yes, he could have amnesia.

220
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,050
This explains why

221
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,970
Cheng Cheng doesn't have Eighth Young Master's

222
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,380
previous memories.

223
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,730
That's because

224
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,140
he is the Cheng Cheng who came from the same world
as I did.

225
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,140
And something caused

226
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,170
him to lose his memories intermittently.

227
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,650
Right, this is it.

228
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,140
Jing Xin,

229
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,580
do you agree with my analysis?

230
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,090
Tan,

231
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,260
I didn't quite understand what you just said.

232
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,900
But if it came out from your mouth,

233
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,140
it must be true.

234
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,410
If this is the case,

235
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,020
I should ask

236
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,340
the imperial physician to take a look.

237
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,210
No, no, no.

238
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,700
We can't breathe a word of this.

239
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,970
Moreover,

240
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,260
you don't have psychologists or

241
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,500
neurologists here.

242
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,340
No way, no way. How can I cure him?

243
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,460
I came up with an idea.

244
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,020
Jing Xin,

245
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,500
prepare a few items for me.

246
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,610
What do you want to do?

247
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,170
You'll see later.

248
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,820
I, Qu Tan, will not fail easily.

249
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,410
I haven't given it all out yet.

250
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,580
I know what to do.

I became an artist from

262
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,580
a realtor

263
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,340
for you.

264
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,260
Although I'd never give up on you,

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,380
you should try your best as well.

Jing Xin.

267
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,050
The script-reading session starts now.

268
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,730
That day,

269
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,140
she climbed onto the wall

270
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,580
and jumped off.

271
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,940
In order to free herself from the restraints
of her family.

272
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,210
When she looked down,

273
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,970
she saw a young gentleman

274
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,970
passing by elegantly.

275
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,060
When they looked at each other,

276
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,210
even the Milky Way seemed to lose its light.

277
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,140
We'll have BGM here.

278
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,610
BGM?

279
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,540
That day, she encountered an ambush.

280
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,420

288
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,300
When her life was hanging by a thread,

289
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,500
at the most dangerous moment,

290
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,500
that same young gentleman

291
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,500
came to her rescue again.

292
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,810
He stepped forward and

293
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,810
killed many attackers.

294
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,730
Unfortunately,

295
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,140
he was hit by an arrow,

296
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,260
and his blood flowed like a river.

We have a lot of promises yet to be fulfilled.

You said you'd protect me forever.

299

I'll fulfill my promise.

301
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,660
They looked deeply into each other's eyes.

Really?

329
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,420
I've decided on the leading actor and actress.

330
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,930
Jing Xin and Shi Si.

331
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,930

333
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
I want to ask.

334
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,610
Are women in the story

335
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,180
only thinking about love and romance?

336
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,540
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

337
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,810
Or the need to protect their country?

Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

364
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,500
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

365
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,140
What role can I play?
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

366
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

367
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,900
You can play the assassin with the best
martial arts skills
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

368
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,930
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

369
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,020
among all the assassins that come in flocks.
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

370
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,330
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

371
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,330
Okay, okay.
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

372
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,380
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

373
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,500
Cheng Cheng, I wrote
Don't they have any social responsibilities
for their country or their families?

374
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,970
Cheng Cheng, I wrote

375
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,060
all our important moments

376
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,140
into the script word-for-word.

377
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
You should have a familiar feeling

378
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,690
after watching it.

379
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,330
Ladies and gentlemen.

380
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,570
To enrich

381
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,300
our cultural and recreational activities,

382
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,970
I, as the director and scriptwriter,

383
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,450
have produced an avant-garde play,

384
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,450
Love under a Sakura Tree,
(Love under the Sakura tree)
Love under the Sakura tree.

385
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,660
for everyone to watch.

386
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,690
This play tells the story
of how a young gentleman and a lady

387
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,900
meet and fall into a marvelous
romantic relationship.

388
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,780
This handsome young gentleman is

389
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,610
Romeo.

390
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,140
This kind, smart

391
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,380
and pretty lady is

392
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,020
Juliet.

393
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,900
Now, let's appreciate their

394
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,570
love story.

395
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,090
Move, sprinkle the petals.
(Sakura tree)
Come.

396
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,660
Come help me down.

397
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,020
It's improper for men and women to have
physical contact.

398
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,730
How's this?

399
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,730
Isn't this opening romantic?

400
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,850
Vulgar.

401
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,970
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

402
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,300
Don't worry.
(Sakura tree)
Don't be scared.

403
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,300
Wait for me.

404
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,140
Go die.

405
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,610
I don't want to!

406
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,500
No!

407
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,140
Go to hell!

408
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,540
(Sakura tree)
Don't be scared.

409
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,180
I...

410
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,730
Go away.

411
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,380
I won't die.

412
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,420
Get out. Go away, go away.

413
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,330
Don't worry.

414
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,780
I'll ensure your safety.

415
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,810
Your Highness, you are finally here.

416
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,900
Tan Er.

417
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,420
Why is the man protecting the woman in your play?

418
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,450
Put your focus on the romance.

419
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,450
Okay.

420
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,610
If I'm in such danger,

421
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,500
will you come to my rescue like that?

422
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,780
The Residence is strictly guarded.

423
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,480

424
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,200

♪Hard to predict that it'll become a prison♪

441
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,060
Don't you think the story is really touching?

442
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,570
Do you sense any familiarities?

443
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,020
Disgusting.

444
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,180
(Love under the Sakura tree)

445
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,930
(Love under the Sakura tree)
Eighth Brother.

446
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,060
Tan Er, please don't blame him.

447
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,570
This play is a little hard to understand.

448
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,260
Look.

449
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,090
If you change the kissing scenes

450
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,060
into them reading together,

451
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,060
won't this be more...

452
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,180
Tan Er.

453
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,380
Shi Si, then let's...

454
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,480
(Sakura tree)

455
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,880
(Love under the Sakura tree)

456
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,610
I think

457
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,020
Second Princess's behaviour has changed
dramatically.

458
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,540
Tell me more.

459
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,450
Second Princess is no longer
as indecisive as before.

460
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,450
She arranges plays at her residence with
no regards to superiority and inferiority.

461
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,060
In the play, the man is intelligent and brave,

462
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,970
but the woman is a deadbeat.

463
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,450
She said it was based on
her personal experience.

464
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,420
Also...

465
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,260
Also what?

466
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,500
Second Princess grew up with the consort.

467
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,420
However, she barely talks to the consort now.

468
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,260
This really is strange.

469
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,380
Is it possible that Qu Tan Er has already...

470
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,330
Is it possible that this one is a fraud?

471
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,570
If someone is really pretending to be
the second princess...

472
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,780
However, we still haven't found

473
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,730
the second princess's corpse.

474
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,930
Someone is always listening.

475
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,420
My mistake.

476
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,260
Get ready.

477
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,690
We'll go visit this Qu Tan Er tomorrow.

478
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,690
Five words drifted from the sky,

479
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,420
so many things are happening in one day.

480
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,450
I wave to the sky,

481
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,380
nothing matters.

482
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,810
Please let me see through this life.

483
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,850
Seize the moment and enjoy the present.

484
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,420
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself.

485
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,690
Tan.

486
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,180
Tan.

487
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,380
Secondary Prince Consort said he doesn't
want to see you.

488
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,970
However, he is

489
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,140
playing with a sword in the yard.

490
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,570
Petty things.

491
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,020
Love starts with

492
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,610
feeling nervous and shy.

493
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,610
The more you don't want to see someone,
the more you want to see them.

494
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,810
Did you scare him earlier today?

495
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,970
Being lyrical is useless

496
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,300
and wouldn't gain any liking.

497
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,140
If I don't do something bold,

498
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,140
he won't even know

499
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,780
how important I am in his heart.

500
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,140
But Tan.

501
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,300
You are a woman

502
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,690
and more importantly, a princess.

503
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,730
It doesn't look so proper to be this proactive.

504
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,060
Even though it's easy for women to pursue men

505
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,730
but extremely hard for men to pursue women.

506
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,300
Cheng Cheng is so dull.

507
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,420
What else can I do if I'm not being proactive?

508
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,850
But, but I think...

509
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,780
It's fine, take it easy.

510
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,060
I have everything under control.

511
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,020
Don't peep.

512
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,210
This is my surprise for Cheng Cheng tomorrow.

513
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,500
Then I'll leave.

514
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,810
Go ahead...

515
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,300
I'm so sleepy.

516
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,660
Stupid Mo Lian Cheng.

517
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,090
Days have passed.

518
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,610
Maybe he's still mad?

519
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,280
(Like you. A prairie.)

520
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,820
There is nothing serious in this notebook.

521
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,120
(Can't take my eyes off you. The sea is the sea.
The mountain is the mountain.)

522
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,620
Childish.

523
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,300
Tan.

524
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,410
Ambushing at the door early in the morning

525
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
doesn't match your status.

526
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,690
How about this.

527
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,890
I'll send people over

528
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,860
to get Secondary Consort for you.

529
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,210
Don't.

530
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,130
Come back.

531
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,650
Hurry, come back and hide.

532
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,690
Hide.

533
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,370
Jing Xin.

534
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,450
Calm down.

535
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,690
You really have the mindset of a straight woman.

536
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,860
What is a "straight woman"?

537
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,540
Jing Xin, this way.

538
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,060
Listen to me.

539
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,170
When Yu Hao comes out,

540
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,410
tell him that

541
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,730
the princess

542
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,130
is staying at Mo Yan Chen's chambers every night,

543
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,930
lives licentiously and doesn't care about
government affairs.

544
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,410
You really can't stand it anymore,

545
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,730
so you've come to ask him for help.

546
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,500
Then, what will you do?

547
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,100
I'll just wait here.

548
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,340
I don't think Mo Lian Cheng will be able to
stay put after hearing that.

549
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,780
Okay.

550
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,500
Be careful.

551
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:55,930
Jing Xin.

552
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,890
You've got this.

553
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,580
Yu Hao!

554
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,300
Mo Lian Cheng,

555
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,170
if you can stay put after finding out that
I'm having an affair,

556
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,370
then you truly don't love me anymore.

557
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,820
What do you need?

558
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,020
Be quick.

559
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,130
Keep your distance.

560
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
I have something to tell you.

561
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,890
Please tell your Eighth Young Master that

562
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,860
our Second Princess

563
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,780
is wasting her days away with Eldest Young Master,

564
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
and doesn't care about government affairs.

565
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,450
Most importantly...

566
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,450
Most importantly, I can't even rest.

567
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,780
Please tell him.

568
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,540
Oh my god.

569
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,650
This is terrible, terrible, terrible.

570
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,580
Mo Lian Cheng, I'll definitely catch you
this time.

571
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,340
I'm passing on Eighth Young Master's words.

572
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,170
Come down!

573
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,930
What did he say?

574
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,170
Eighth Young Master said that...

575
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,370
Even though it's childish,

576
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,450
it's harmless.

577
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,820
As long as Your Highness is happy.

578
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,170
Her Highness is childish,
and her behavior is harmful.

579
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,780
She can stay with whomever she likes,

580
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,130
and do whatever she wants.

581
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,970
Stay here.

582
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,650
Speaking of government affairs...

583
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,930
In the end, I can't

584
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,780
carry her political responsibilities
for a long period of time.

585
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,340
She should start picking up government affairs

586
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,130
as soon as possible.

587
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,410
I will no longer help Her Highness.

588
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,260
Never.

589
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,730
I wish...

590
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,370
Finally, I wish Her Highness all the best.

591
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,620
Wishing Her Highness and the consort
the best

592
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,970
and looking forward to hearing the patter
of tiny feet.

593
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,500
The end.

594
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,340
The end?

595
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,930
Why don't you leave after you're done?

596
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,450
I'm not telling you next time.

597
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,820
Mo Lian Cheng.

598
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,340
Stupid Mo Lian Cheng.

599
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,020
Jing Xin.

600
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,780
Your approach is more effective.

601
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,930
Break down the door.

602
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,130
