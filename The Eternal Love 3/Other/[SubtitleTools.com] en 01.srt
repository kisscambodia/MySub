Cheng...

17
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,660
There's no need to hide.

18
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,890
Are the two beauties I married today

19
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,460
both in the room?

20
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,410
My two beauties,

21
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,940
sorry to have kept you waiting.

22
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Isn't this exciting?

23
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,660
Curious about what happened?

24
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,690
The story began

25
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,250
a month ago.

26
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,250
As per quantum physics,

27
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,460
the universe is continually expanding
from a speck.

28
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,130
After reaching its limit,

29
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,050
it'll tear away to form multiple
parallel universes.

30
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,220
You won't know which day, or moment,

31
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,100
a new universe, a new Dongyue,

32
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,940
will be born.

33
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,690
But at this moment, this is still
the same Dongyue.

34
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,020
A Dongyue governed by
Emperor Mo Lian Cheng and

35
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,330
his Empress, Qu Xiao Tan.

36
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,890
You two, head over there to look for it.

37
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,740
Yes.

38
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,460
Little Prince.

39
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,330
Yu Er.

40
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,330
Little Prince.

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
(A loving family)

42
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,050
Xiao Tan, look at this.

43
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,220
The Little Prince

44
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
threw his homework everywhere.

45
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,580
What should we do?

46
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,970
Stupid Mo Lian Cheng.

47
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,260
He's having it so easy.

48
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,770
Why should I be the one taking care of the child

49
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,700
and helping him with his homework?

50
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,050
Mo Lian Cheng, that bastard.

51
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,500
To think he said he'd be the one
to bear children in the next lifetime.

52
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,820
I regret bearing a child with him
even in this lifetime.

53
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,700
So what if he's the Emperor?

54
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,730
I still have my real estate career.

55
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,100
Yu Er, Yu Er!

56
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,330
This drawing is pretty good.

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,570
Assassins!

58
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm sorry for not coming in time.

59
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,330
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

60
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,730
It's okay.

61
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,700
Yu Er,

62
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,100
if you really don't feel like learning,

63
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,420
go take an afternoon nap.

64
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,850
If you're going to keep behaving like this,

65
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,380
I'm going to collapse soon.

66
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,450
I'm not learning, I'm not learning,
I refuse!

67
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,170
What happened? Upset with Yu Er again?

68
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,850
Isn't Yu Er quite well-behaved?

69
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,610
You taught him well.

70
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,170
You have a talent for raising children.

71
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,570
Forget it, I'm not teaching him.

72
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,050
Just let him be a happy little fool.

73
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,170
Yu Er is a prince of Dongyue,

74
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,450
the future Emperor,

75
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,260
and an upright and strong man.

76
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,970
How can he be a little fool?

77
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,730
If he were a girl,

78
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,020
he would be able to freely…

79
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,530
What do you mean by "if he were a girl"?

80
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,940
What's wrong with being a girl?

81
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,780
Mo Lian Cheng, you're being sexist.

82
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,700
Tan Er, stop messing around.

83
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,340
You're tired, I'm tired too.

84
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,650
Men should be upright and strong,

85
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,380
but women can be little fools, is that it?

86
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,530
You're the one who brought about "fool".

87
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,900
Men can go to work, earn money,
and become the Emperor.

88
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,610
Women just stay home, wash clothes, cook,
and raise children.

89
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,340
Is that it?

90
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,170
Since when have you washed clothes or cooked?

91
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,650
The servants have always been the ones
doing the work.

92
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,340
Stay away from me. I'm frustrated.

93
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,020
Look at me.

94
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,500
My hands are red, I haven't even washed them.

95
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,970
Okay, okay.

96
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,340
I have to attend court every day,

97
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,090
and pamper you and Yu Er afterwards.

98
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,380
I'm tired too.

99
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,780
You're not the only one who's tired,
I'm tired too.

100
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,380
At the outskirts of the city with Yu Hao just now,
we...

101
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,140
Yu Er!

102
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,730
Yu Er!

103
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,530
Yu Er!

104
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,900
Didn't Qu Jiang Lin die a long time ago?

105
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,290
Am I seeing ghosts?

106
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,260
This must be a nightmare.

107
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,940
I need to go back to sleep, back to sleep,

108
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,850
Your Highness, don't be scared.
I'm here for you.

109
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,380
Jing Xin?

110
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,780
Your Highness, why are you frightened?

111
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,850
I'm here, I will ensure your safety.

112
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,820
Highness?

113
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,900
That's right.

114
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,500
Your Highness has finally woken up,
this is great news.

115
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,820
You've just recovered,

116
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,260
I'm afraid you may still be in shock.

117
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,170
Still in shock?

118
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,210
Yes, I'm still in shock.

119
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,140
Don't come any closer.

120
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,730
Stay away from me.

121
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,900
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng!

122
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,090
Yu Er, where's Yu Er?

123
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,700
Cheng Cheng, Yu Er, where are you?

124
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,940
The Soul-guarding Pearl was unstable.

125
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Could it be that time has been tampered with?

126
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,650
That can't be.

127
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,380
Before Qu Jiang Lin died,

128
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,900
I hadn't become the princess either.

129
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,500
Tan Er,

130
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,650
what's wrong with you?

131
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,970
You're the second princess of Dongyue!

132
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,940
You'll have a chance to inherit
the empire in the future.

133
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,700
You mustn't develop any bad habits.

134
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,170
Inherit the empire?

135
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,050
Me?

136
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,970
Inherit what position?

137
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,650
What's going on?

138
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,970
How did falling into the water
damage your brain this much?

139
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,410
Tan Er, let me be honest with you.

140
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,410
The Empress initially thought more highly of you.

141
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,580
But looking at you now,

142
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,580
the responsibility can only fall

143
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,090
onto your elder sister, Mei Er's shoulders.

144
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,210
Think it through carefully.

145
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,780
Mei Er?

146
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,380
Elder sister Mei Er?

147
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,700
I fell into the water?

148
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,170
No, no, no, no.

149
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,650
It's not what you think.

150
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,140
Your elder sister Mei Er is your only kin.

151
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,380
I swear on my life,

152
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,820
you falling into the water
had nothing to do with her.

153
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,970
Could it be that Qu Mei Er is Qu Pan Er?

154
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,340
The names changed?

155
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,170
But looking at how protective
Qu Jiang Lin is being,

156
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,580
it could very well be that Tan Er
falling into the water this time

157
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,260
was caused by this new elder sister.

158
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,900
You've been alive all this time?

159
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,780
You've always been a guard?

160
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,020
Tan Er, think about it.

161
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,700
Both you and Mei Er's mothers passed away early.

162
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,700
Wasn't it me

163
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,410
who raised both of you by myself?

164
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,500
If you still don't believe your father,

165
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,940
your mother up in heaven right now
wouldn't be pleased.

166
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,530
Okay, okay, okay.

167
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,260
Let me ask you.

168
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm Princess Qu Tan Er,

169
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,780
and my elder sister is Qu Mei Er?

170
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,820
Yes.

171
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,610
I'm done for.

172
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,210
Don't tell me I...

173
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,850
What kind of luck do I have?

174
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,780
It seems that I've entered a universe
in which gender roles are reversed.

175
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,900
Then... what about Cheng Cheng?

176
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,290
And my Yu Er?

177
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,700
Cheng Cheng?

178
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,410
My Tan Er!

179
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,290
No, I can't trust Qu Jiang Lin.

180
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,210
Before I find out where Cheng Cheng is,

181
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,580
I can't carelessly reveal his existence.

182
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,730
I'll pretend to be Qu Tan Er

183
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,500
and try to get some inside info first.

184
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,970
Father,

185
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,170
I think my brain has indeed been damaged
after falling into the water.

186
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,340
But

187
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,090
I don't blame elder sister Mei Er.

188
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,050
But others might read more into it.

189
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,460
As a father,

190
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,610
I think

191
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,530
you're in a difficult position, right?

192
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,780
Yes.

193
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,020
Although I'm the Empress's cousin,

194
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,460
I'm still just a man.

195
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:29,970
What?

196
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,260
He's the Empress's cousin?

197
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,650
The Empress is my aunt?

198
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,380
My new sister and I are princesses?

199
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,780
This is a mess, it's all a mess.

200
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,020
Father, you must have suffered.

201
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,170
You're a man and you were born in the palace.

202
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,610
Life mustn't be easy for you.

203
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,970
As a man, it's never easy.

204
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,210
According to the rules of Dongyue,

205
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,260
men are subordinate to women.

206
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,460
After all, women

207
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,850
have to train themselves to govern the country.

208
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,580
Men should be loyal husbands,

209
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,940
and be virtuous and submissive.

210
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,780
The ruling Empress has no children,

211
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,900
so she wants to choose between you and Mei Er

212
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,650
to inherit the throne.

213
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm happy for the both of you.

214
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,140
But I'm also worried and being extremely careful.

215
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,900
I'm afraid something bad might happen.

216
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,780
Tan Er, you've always been gentle and magnanimous.

217
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,340
I just want you and Mei Er to get along well,

218
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,500
so that I can have peace in my mind.

219
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,820
If I hadn't known what kind of person you were,

220
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,050
I would've actually believed you.

221
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,410
I understand.

222
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,820
Just that...

223
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,140
I'm not feeling too well now.

224
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,460
I want to take a rest.

225
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,210
Don't worry, Father.

226
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,780
How about you head back first?

227
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,050
Okay, okay, okay.

228
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,020
Look at me.

229
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,020
I got carried away because I was so happy

230
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,090
to see that you've recovered.

231
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,210
Your Highness, do take care.

232
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,300
Jing Xin, do you know

233
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,570
someone called Mo Lian Cheng?

234
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,900
The eighth young master of the Mo family?

235
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,330
Yes, yes, that's him.

236
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
Where is he now?

237
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,850
He should be in the palace today
taking part in the harem selection.

238
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,730
He should be waiting to be selected
at this very moment.

239
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,060
Harem selection?

240
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,690
Is that what I think it is?

241
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,970
It's to be chosen as part of the Empress's harem.

242
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,570
Your Highness, where are you going?

243
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,540
Snatching my groom.

244
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,850
Come.

245
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,380
Eighth Brother, why are you nervous?

246
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,140
With your qualifications,
you can definitely get chosen.

247
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,090
In any case, the Empress had long ago...

248
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,900
Eldest Brother,

249
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,260
I've spoken too much.

250
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,540
But ever since the accident,

251
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,180
you've become sullen and quiet.

252
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,380
You used to be very familiar with Her Majesty.

253
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,930
I sincerely wish

254
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,540
you may be together with the one you love.

255
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,210
Be together with the one you love?

256
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,500
As expected as the Eighth Young Master of Mo family.

257
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,140
But… who have you gotten involved with

258
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,570
before you've gotten married?

259
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,300
Young Master Su, please mind your words.

260
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,500
We are before the Empress's palace.

261
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,660
We are indeed before the Empress's palace,

262
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,900
also a familiar place to Eighth Young Master.

263
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,420
I wonder why he's joining the selection
together with us.

264
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,330
I thought

265
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Eighth Young Master had joined the harem long ago.

266
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,020
According to my understanding,

267
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,660
the supervising officer today is Official Su,

268
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,660
who is Young Master Su's eldest sister.

269
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,970
Did she not arrange for you
to participate in the selection?

270
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,780
You're spouting rubbish!

271
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,450
You dare accuse my eldest sister
of practicing favoritism!

272
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,730
Eighth Brother.

273
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,300
You…!

274
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,610
Given Young Master Su's personality,

275
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,380
you should speak less,

276
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,660
in case you cause trouble for Official Su.

277
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,850
Eighth Brother...

278
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,380
Eldest Brother, don't worry.

279
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,300
Okay, then I'll see you off here.

280
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,500
I look forward to hearing good news from you.

281
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

282
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,420
Rise.

283
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,570
Greetings, Your Highness.

284
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
You may rise.

285
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,210
Greetings, Your Highness.

286
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

287
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,180
All rise.

288
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,730
It's different being a princess now.

289
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,810
This is awesome.

290
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,450
Jing Xin, do they all know me?

291
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,420
Everyone in the palace would.

292
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,060
Some of the lower-ranking servants
outside the palace

293
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,730
may not.

294
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,930
Your Highness,

295
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,090
you dropped this.

296
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,300
This perfume sachet is quite pretty.

297
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,850
Let me help you put it on.

298
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,260
I was in a hurry to leave the house
earlier this morning,

299
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,780
and almost made a big mistake.

300
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,900
This perfume sachet was presented
by the Empress.

301
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,970
The perfume powder inside is extremely precious.

302
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,610
Butterflies love this scent the most.

303
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,970
Aren't you a guard?

304
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,850
How do you know so much about perfume powders?

305
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,060
I naturally know every single detail

306
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,780
about Your Highness. It's my duty.

307
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,930
I know what girls are thinking.

308
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,500
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng!

309
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,180
Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng!

310
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,500
Your Highness, who are you calling?

311
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,020
My dear, my husband.

312
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,180
My Cheng Cheng!

313
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,180
Cheng Cheng!

314
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,060
Your Highness, please stop shouting.

315
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,450
They're waiting to be selected into the harem.

316
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,970
Before they're chosen,
they're considered the Empress's men.

317
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,540
Why would your husband be there?

318
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,900
In any case, you're not engaged yet.

319
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,420
That's true.

320
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,450
There are many people in this palace,
I mustn't expose myself.

321
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,020
I should figure out the situation first.

322
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

323
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,730
Your Highness, what are you doing?

324
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,380
I need to find a way to sneak in.

325
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,300
Sneak?

326
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,570
Second Princess.

327
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,900
Greetings, Official Su.

328
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,780
Greetings, Second Princess.

329
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,810
Could I know what you intend to do?

330
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm just having a look around.

331
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,780
I wasn't thinking of going in.

332
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,020
How can that be?

333
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,210
Her Majesty selected Your Highness and me

334
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,500
to co-host the harem selection.

335
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,690
If you don't go in, how will we select the harem?

336
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,610
Co-host?

337
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,420
I'm just coming here to observe first.

338
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,500
Su… Official Su...

339
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,660
I'll leave it to you to handle this harem selection.

340
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,330
It's my duty.

341
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,540
Her Majesty already instructed me.

342
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,180
Your Highness only needs to attend it.

343
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,060
So she's Su Yue La,

344
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,330
the Empress's trusted aide.

345
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,660
These months, I've been trying to cover up,

346
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,500
and adapt to my surroundings as much as possible,

347
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
so that no one would realize I've lost my memory.

348
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,140
But I still feel that

349
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
the rules in this universe are hard for me to grasp.

350
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,570
Men are beneath women?

351
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,540
Abide by a code of virtue and be a loyal husband?

352
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,810
These practices are all so restrictive.

353
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,610
I just can't believe

354
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,540
I was raised in such an environment.

355
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,060
I'm trying to figure out
how things end up this way.

356
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,930
Eighth Brother, you're awake.

357
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,090
Lian Cheng.

358
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,140
Cheng Cheng,

359
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,930
Cheng Cheng,

360
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,850
Cheng Cheng.

361
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,540
Cheng Cheng, I'm not the Empress.

362
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,330
You've misunderstood.

363
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,140
So you don't need to enter the harem.

364
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,020
Pay attention to my signals during
the next selection process.

365
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,930
I'll find a way to get you eliminated.

366
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,300
Forgive me, Your Highness.

367
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,140
You've misspoken.

368
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,850
You know I'm the princess?

369
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,380
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you were saying.

370
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,060
May Your Highness

371
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,180
please stop speaking such heresy.

372
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,140
Can't you recognize me?

373
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,690
Oh, there are many people here, it's not convenient.

374
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Young Master Mo,

375
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
you passed the test with flying colours.

376
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,570
I have much admiration for you.

377
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,210
I must encourage you.

378
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,260
Keep up the good work!

379
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,330
Everyone, keep up the good work!

380
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,610
Keep it up!

381
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,900
Go, go, go!

382
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,210
Where did he go?

383
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,260
Forget it.

384
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,850
I should find a way to get him eliminated first.

385
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,780
Then I'll find an opportunity to bump into him.

386
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,970
Not handsome enough. Eliminated.

387
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,380
The water is too hot. Eliminated.

388
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,260
There's dirt between your fingernails. Eliminated.

389
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,970
The tea isn't clean. Eliminated.

390
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,540
Pieces of your scalp have even fallen into the cup.

391
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,450
Eliminated!

392
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,380
You…

393
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,930
What's up with him?

394
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,970
He's not making any mistakes himself.

395
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,210
The tea is overflowing. Eliminated.

396
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,730
Looks like this difficult little punk

397
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,730
doesn't want Mo Lian Cheng
to get through even more than me.

398
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,330
I'm depending on you.

399
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,540
Bold of you!

400
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,690
Mo Lian Cheng has no manners! Eliminated!

401
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,140
I thought we were being tested
on our knowledge and skills of preparing tea.

402
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,930
I didn't know we were being tested on our agility.

403
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,090
You spilled water on me,

404
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,300
and now you're mocking me?

405
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,260
Insubordination!

406
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,140
Get out of here immediately!

407
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:20,900
This...

408
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,380
Your Highness… Your Highness, what's going on?

409
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,570
You and I both know he belongs to Her Majesty.

410
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,090
Why offend Her Majesty

411
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,540
over such a small thing?

412
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,730
Official Su, you're saying that

413
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,930
he must be selected no matter what?

414
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,020
I shall be magnanimous.

415
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,060
As long as Mo Lian Cheng
serves me and changes my outfit,

416
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,140
I'll forgive you just this once.

417
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,300
Bring some clean clothes for me.

418
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,060
But…

419
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,970
I wouldn't dare deny the order from Your Highness.

420
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,610
What's going on?

421
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,090
(Jing Yi Pavilion)
Cheng Cheng, I can’t do this by myself.

422
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,780
Come and give me a hand.

423
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,330
There are boundaries between men and women.

424
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,660
May Your Highness stop addressing me
like that, please.

425
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,300
You really don't know who I am?

426
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,850
Your Highness, I know you are the second princess.

427
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,380
So frustrating.

428
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,450
But he doesn't look like he's pretending.

429
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,450
But it doesn't seem like
he has lost your memory either.

430
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,610
Don't tell me this is just like the previous time.

431
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,540
He's the Mo Lian Cheng from this parallel universe.

432
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,780
Cheng Cheng was assassinated before.

433
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,500
I should confirm this first.

434
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,930
It seems that your clothes are wet as well.

435
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,930
How about we change out together?

436
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,810
Your Highness, are you teasing me?

437
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,970
What are you talking about?

438
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,900
Why would I be teasing you?

439
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,260
I'm concerned about you.

440
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,780
Can't you tell?

441
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,090
So fast?

442
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,780
Didn't you want to take a look?

443
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,500
Why are you being shy now?

444
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,420
If Your Highness has mercy on me,

445
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,500
and won't tell anyone about this,

446
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,500
I have no issues with
letting Your Highness have a look.

447
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,810
Don't worry, I won't.

448
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,660
He's really not Cheng Cheng.

449
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,780
What was she saying about pretending just now?

450
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,090
And now she wants to inspect my body?

451
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,500
Does she know something?

452
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,260
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
I've finished changing.

454
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:20,930
I'll be leaving now.

455
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,610
Please wait, Your Highness.

456
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,380
Don't worry,

457
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,060
I'll take it that nothing happened today.

458
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,810
I won't say a word. It won't affect your reputation.

459
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,780
When asking me to change just now,

460
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,380
it didn't seem like

461
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,210
Your Highness was someone who would care about
the reputation of others.

462
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,970
I asked you to change,

463
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,660
not to remove your clothes for me.

464
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,330
What were you looking for, Your Highness?

465
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,930
How about having a better look?

466
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,540
It's okay, it's okay, I got the wrong person.

467
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,090
Your Highness seems to be
looking for something indeed.

468
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
I was looking for some excitement.

469
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,570
I'm looking for excitement, okay?

470
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,330
I hope you can become the Emperor Consort soon.

471
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,380
I'm in a hurry to look for someone.
I'll be taking my leave.

472
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,970
Goodbye.

473
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,690
Your Highness.

474
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,730
Your Highness, you're done changing?

475
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,210
Let's hurry.

476
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,500
The other candidates
are still waiting to be selected.

477
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,610
But where is Young Master Mo?

478
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,140
He should be changing inside, I guess.

479
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,810
I'll take my leave first.

480
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,450
He doesn't need to change.

481
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,900
All candidates have to change
and be inspected before the harem selection.

482
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,850
Change?

483
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,180
Be inspected?

484
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,570
The candidates?

485
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,540
All removed their clothes?

486
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,090
This is the rule.

487
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,540
In case they have any weapons on them.

488
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,140
Of course, it's also to see

489
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,850
if there are any defects on their bodies.

490
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,330
We have to check them thoroughly.

491
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,610
They all can't compare to Cheng Cheng.

492
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,450
Too skinny.

493
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,690
But some of them are quite good-looking.

494
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,060
It would be better

495
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,020
if they had some abs.

496
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,930
Sorry.

497
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,930
Mo Lian Cheng, what are you doing?

498
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,090
You...

499
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,730
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

500
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,450
I'm staying outside to guard the place.

501
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,300
Guarding the place?

502
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,500
Do we need Your Highness to personally
guard this place?

503
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,780
Why not? Do I owe you?

504
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:11,850
Why's that your business?

505
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,180
Since you're guarding the place,

506
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,060
why did you peek?

507
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,210
Stay away from me. I'm frustrated.

508
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,130
Since when did you wash the clothes or cook?

509
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,580
The servants have always been the ones
doing the work.

510
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Stay away from me. I'm frustrated.

511
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,130
Are you okay?

512
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,210
Tan Er?

513
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,410
Tan Er?

514
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,410
Cheng Cheng, is that really you?

515
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,930
What happened to you?

516
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,260
Cheng Cheng, I've really missed you.

517
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:18,970
Cheng Cheng.

518
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,130
Why does he not recognize me again?

519
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,650
What exactly is going on?

520
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,540
No way. If he's really Cheng Cheng,

521
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,340
I mustn't let him get selected for the harem.

522
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Are you okay, Your Highness?

523
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,370
Young Master Mo, since the inspection has ended,

524
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,170
prepare well for the harem selection.

525
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,410
Your Highness, please.

526
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,620
Looks like

527
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,020
I just need to help Su Jing Yuan.

528
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,100
Go in. Hurry.

529
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,620
I wonder if the empress is as pretty as they say.

530
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,620
No matter what,

531
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,620
forget about marrying my Cheng Cheng.

532
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,100
Long live the Empress.

533
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,060
All rise.
