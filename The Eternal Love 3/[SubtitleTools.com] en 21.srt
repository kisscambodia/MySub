16
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,320
Mr. Lin.

17
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,360
Lei Yuzheng had quite a fall this time.

18
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,520
It'll take a while for him
to make a comeback.

19
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,080
I didn't expect that.

20
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,559
I…

21
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,279
What didn't you expect?

22
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
Nothing.

23
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,320
Mr. Lin, it's good that
Lei Yuzheng is gone now.

24
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,320
Why do you still seem
to worry a lot?

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,559
You can take this chance
to get promoted, right?

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,839
Promoted?

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,759
I, Lin Xiangyuan, will never
take advantage of other people.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,839
I was gonna fight with
Lei Yuzheng face to face.

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
If I win then,

30
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,279
it means that
I am really  more capable than him.

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,800
But the result means everything.

32
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,919
As long as you become the president of Yutian,

33
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,080
no one cares about
what means you took.

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,119
They will all look up to you.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Xieli,

36
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,839
what do you think
Lei Yuzheng is doing right now?

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,199
What else can he do?

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,839
He must be crying out loud at the court.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,279
Now, the old is in hospital,

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,919
and the young is in jail.

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,000
Now it's time for you, Mr. Lin,
to take charge.

42
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,880
Mr. Jiang, directors are waiting for you
to join the meeting.

43
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,440
Look at this,
these reporters are going way too far.

44
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,360
They used such title as
"Yutian's stock market scandal" and

45
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,679
"Construction of Entertainment Center
project might be called off".

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,679
They are talking nonsense.

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,039
Mr. Jiang,
that's what reporters usually do.

48
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,360
As long as they can make
a big news out of something,

49
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,000
they would exaggerate everything.

50
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,440
Speaking of that,

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,039
not only those reporters,

52
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,839
but also our employees are

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,880
talking about rumors right now.

54
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,839
What do you mean?

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
They are all saying that

56
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,119
it will take a while for Lei Yuzheng
to make a comeback.

57
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,960
And if no one takes the lead right now,

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
the Entertainment Center project
will be affected.

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,240
Mr. Jiang,

60
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,359
everyone is waiting for you
to take the lead.

61
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,760
But I don't know much about

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,760
the Entertainment City project.

63
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,559
If I take over right now,

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,399
isn't it too hasty?

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,079
I might trap myself

66
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:03,440
later on.

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
By the way, Mr. Jiang,

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,079
is Fanlv feeling better?

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,559
How's her appetite?

70
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,679
I'm planning to go back to my hometown,

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,279
and bring some delicacies
for her to improve her health.

72
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,679
Fanlv is fine.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,279
Xiangyuan, you are very thoughtful.

74
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,920
Ah, regarding the
Entertainment Center project,

75
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,880
you know it the best
besides Lei Yuzheng.

76
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,920
Come and join the meeting with me.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,799
Lin, have a seat.

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,480
Regarding what happened to
Yutian recently,

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,959
I don't have to recap it.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Why don't all of you

81
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,679
contribute your ideas?

82
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,279
Such a big company

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,720
needs a leader.

84
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,720
Jiang, you should think of a way.

85
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,600
Yuzheng is in trouble,

86
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,320
and brother Ting is in the hospital.

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,559
Everyone must be very anxious.

88
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
But it's still important

89
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,079
to maintain the order
within the company.

90
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Why don't we vote by raising hands

91
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,920
to elect a temporary president
to take charge for now?

92
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,679
How does that sound?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
As far as I'm concerned,
we can skip that step.

94
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,440
The one who can take charge
is you, Mr. Jiang.

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,720
You should take this position.

96
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,000
Me?

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,119
No, no, no. How could it be me?

98
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,559
Don't be modest.

99
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
The Entertainment Center project
belonged to Xinsheng in the first place.

100
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,640
Although Yutian is in charge of
the development,

101
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,079
you also have the responsibility.

102
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,239
Mr. Jiang, don't be so modest.

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,920
Mr. Jiang, you should take it.

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
Mr. Jiang, I will vote for you.

105
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:00,679
I agree.

106
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,679
Yes, I agree.

107
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,040
All right. Since everyone has
such high expectation in me,

108
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,160
and we should take the overall interests
of the company into account.

109
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:13,399
I will just take this position for now,

110
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,920
and hope everyone could understand.

111
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,000
Of course.

112
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,720
But a leader cannot fight by oneself.

113
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,480
It's not enough to do it all

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,119
by myself.

115
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,119
Lin has been my assistant
for so many years.

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,160
We've built great rapport
with each other.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Everyone here has witnessed

118
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,320
his ability.

119
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,079
So I suggest that I will supervise

120
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,880
the Entertainment Center project,
and Lin will be in charge.

121
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,959
I know that Lin is my future son-in-law,

122
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,799
and I should have left him out of this,
so that people won't gossip about it.

123
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,679
But to the benefit of Yutian
and the Entertainment Center project,

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,000
I think we can entrust Lin
with this task.

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,640
Lin, the investment that
you were working on

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
is still possible, right?

127
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,760
I'll keep working on it.
I think it is possible for us to get it.

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,920
If Lin can collect money
for the Entertainment Center project,

129
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,959
he will be the hero of Yutian.

130
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,959
We can't even thank him enough.

131
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Everyone,

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,279
at the very beginning,
Xinsheng cooperated with Yutian

133
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,160
on the Entertainment Center project
by offering it as a gift.

134
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,119
Since the board has decided

135
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,959
that I will take charge of this project,

136
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,760
I know how much responsibility I have.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,920
I won't let anyone down.

138
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,239
(Police)

139
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,599
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

140
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,799
Get off the car.

141
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,579
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

142
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,760
According to Article 180

143
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,400
of the Criminal Law
of the People’s Republic of China,

144
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:29,280
the defendant Lei Yuzheng,
the prior president of Yutian,

145
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
is sentenced for 8 month detention
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

146
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,880
due to the charge of
disclosing confidential information,

147
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,760
and immediate execution is required.

148
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,499
(Silence)

149
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,880
Time is a one way road.

150
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,559
You can only move forward
without going back.

151
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,239
There's no pure luck in this world.

152
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,960
Everyone needs to pay the price
for their mistakes.

153
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,400
Go inside.

154
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,280
My name is Liu Siyang.

155
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,479
It must be the first time for you.

156
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,000
I can tell that
you're not used to here yet.

157
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,679
It will be better in a few days.

158
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,559
Here you are.

159
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,400
Xiaosu, it was on TV.

160
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,440
Did Lei Yuzheng actually go to jail?

161
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,239
I couldn't do anything about it.

162
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,200
There was no evidence and

163
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
nothing was beneficial towards him.

164
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,880
He also didn't want to explain about it,

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,239
and took all the responsibilities
by himself.

166
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,679
So,

167
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,159
I couldn't do anything
but watching him get accused.

168
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,799
It's all my fault.

169
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,760
I couldn't do anything.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,479
I couldn't help him.

171
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,599
What happened to Lei Yuzheng this time

172
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,520
is really a big issue.

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,159
Since when...

174
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,119
Siqi,

175
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,719
Let's break up.

176
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,679
What did you say?

177
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,559
Mr. Lei went to jail,

178
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
and the chairman is in a coma.

179
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,880
It's all because of me.

180
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,719
Since the past cannot be changed,

181
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,799
I cannot just sit here and

182
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,880
have date with you.

183
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:38,119
He Qunfei, what is wrong with you?

184
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,559
Don't regret if you say this.

185
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,159
There's nothing to regret.

186
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,080
Things are already this bad.

187
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,479
I deserve whatever it costs.

188
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,960
He Qunfei, don't be so impulsive.

189
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,159
You can leave this behind.

190
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,640
He Qunfei,

191
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,799
you wanna break up, right?

192
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,440
From now on, let's go our own ways.

193
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,799
Don't you dare regret it.

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,320
Siqi.

195
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,000
He Qunfei, get out of here now.

196
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,359
Now.

197
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,359
Siqi, calm down.

198
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,960
Xiaosu.

199
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,440
I really appreciate your help
this whole time.

200
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,599
See you.

201
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
What are you two doing?

202
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,919
You can't fall asleep, right?

203
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,880
There're only two of us

204
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,039
in this 9-square meter room.

205
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,159
If you keep silent like this,

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,039
it won't be long till

207
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,840
we both got crazy.

208
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,919
You seem to be

209
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,320
someone who has power,

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,080
and can't bear with living in jail.

211
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,960
No wonder.

212
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,080
Rich people,

213
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,080
who's like you,

214
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,880
always seem proud when nothing happens.

215
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,239
As long as they get troubled,

216
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,559
they would look hopeless.

217
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,159
I look down on people like you.

218
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
What did you say?

219
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,239
Nothing.

220
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,200
I don't have respect
for people like you.

221
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,440
Why?

222
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,000
Too weak.

223
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,559
You hit me?

224
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,799
Hit me! Come, hit me!

225
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,359
Hit me!

226
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:31,799
Hit me!

227
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,119
Stop it!

228
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,159
Do it!

229
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,440
What are you doing?

230
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,599
What are you doing?

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,840
Stand aside.

232
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,880
Who started first?

233
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,119
Xiangyuan,

234
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,159
was what Fanlv said true?

235
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:55,159
Did He Qunfei really fight you?

236
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,640
Yes.

237
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,200
So, you do have something to do

238
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,719
with Lei Yuzheng's trouble?

239
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,919
Mr. Jiang, I've been serving you
for such a long time.

240
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,400
How could you not trust me?

241
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,239
How could I possibly do such

242
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,640
disgraceful thing?

243
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,559
Yes.

244
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,000
He Qunfei fought me
because of Lei Yuzheng.

245
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,119
But it was because
he cares about Lei Yuzheng so much

246
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,919
that he lost his mind.

247
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,840
He's been thinking of me
as Lei Yuzheng's enemy

248
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
and always suspecting me.

249
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,960
But I can understand that,

250
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,880
because I was sent by Xinsheng anyway,

251
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,000
and I don't have a direct relationship
with Lei Yuzheng.

252
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,280
What do you mean by that?

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,559
It was my idea to send you to Yutian

254
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,200
for the Entertainment Center project.

255
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,640
If He Qunfei is opinionative towards you

256
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,039
just because of this,

257
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,880
he's really shortsighted.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,559
You don't have to care about him.

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,719
Sure.

260
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,119
I will keep it in mind.

261
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,599
Dad, do you think it's that simple?

262
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,400
Fanlv,

263
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,799
do you think I can actually do

264
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,440
anything that hurts Lei Yuzheng?

265
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,320
Do I seem like a cunning person

266
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,119
to you?

267
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,960
I've never been fussy with you.

268
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,080
You loved Lei Yuzheng,

269
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,719
but I don't care, because I love you.

270
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,520
This is my fate.

271
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not complaining about anything.

272
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,200
But you can't just wrong me

273
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,880
because of him.

274
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,840
I'm also  flesh and blood,

275
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,719
and  can get hurt.

276
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,319
Mr. Jiang, I swear that

277
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,000
I never did anything

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
against Lei Yuzheng,

279
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,439
not to mention anything
that would let you down.

280
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,959
If you don't believe me,

281
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,959
you can send me to jail

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,359
to replace Lei Yuzheng.

283
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
I won't say anything.

284
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,839
Don't get in a rage.

285
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,839
Fanlv,

286
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,160
I can understand that

287
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
you worry about Yuzheng.

288
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,640
But you shouldn't wrong Xiangyuan

289
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,040
just because of Yuzheng.

290
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,119
He's your fiance after all.

291
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,760
If you don't even believe in him,

292
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,880
how do you expect him to feel?

293
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,040
Dad.

294
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,479
Mr. Jiang,

295
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,319
It's all worth it

296
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,599
after hearing your words.

297
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,800
Alright, I have nothing else to say.

298
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,160
Xiangyuan, have a seat.

299
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,599
She has been spoiled since

300
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,160
she was a kid.

301
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,079
Please understand and forgive her.

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,959
Mr. Jiang,

303
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,040
meeting Fanlv

304
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,319
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

305
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Don't worry,

306
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,439
I will take care of her in my whole life

307
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,520
and treat her well.

308
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,352
(Medical Room)

309
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,439
Fine.

310
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,079
Who started it?

311
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,760
You sure can handle a lot.

312
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,959
Lei Yuzheng, you just came inside.

313
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,680
I can understand
that you are not in a good mood.

314
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,839
But still, you shouldn't vent your anger

315
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,680
by harming your cellmate.

316
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,680
Read the prison regulations again.

317
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,219
(Prison Rules and Regulations)

318
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,520
Do you know why I keep you two together?

319
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Because you two had similar charges,

320
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,239
you should both reflect on yourselves.

321
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,520
After you get out,

322
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,479
try to be someone
who's beneficial for the society.

323
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,040
Also, I'm telling you that

324
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,000
he has serious heart problem.

325
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,880
We wouldn't even let him do

326
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,640
the works that might exhaust him.

327
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,599
If you keep doing this,

328
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:19,239
you should know the consequences.

329
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,479
Take them away.

330
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,880
Go.

331
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,160
Don't worry, everything's fine at home.

332
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,280
Take care of yourself.

333
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
You too.

334
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,079
How was it?

335
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm sorry,
but the prisoner rejected to see you.

336
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,079
He…

337
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,680
still doesn't want to see me?

338
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,880
Yes.

339
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,400
And he told you not to come again.

340
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,439
But he's quite worried about his father.

341
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,920
Is his father alright?

342
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,800
Please tell him that

343
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,199
his father…

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,079
his father is doing well.

345
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,719
Tell him not to worry.

346
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,640
Here, I brought him some books

347
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,920
and some food.

348
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,479
Please give these to him.

349
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,599
OK.

350
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,839
We'll give it to him after inspection.

351
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Thank you.

352
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:44,359
But he's quite worried about his father.

353
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,119
Is his father alright?

354
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,979
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

355
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:00,179
(He Qunfei)

356
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,920
Hello, Qunfei.

357
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,560
Do you know
which hospital Yuzheng's dad stays at?

358
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,280
Miss, who are you looking for?

359
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,359
I'm here to see Mr. Lei.

360
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,239
You must be Miss Du.

361
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Assistant He just called me.

362
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,719
How's he doing now?

363
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,560
Still the same.

364
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,239
He doesn't have any conscious.

365
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,880
So, we could just sit here and wait.

366
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,560
We couldn't help much.

367
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,920
Can I speak to him for a bit?

368
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,040
Sure.

369
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,079
Thank you.

370
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,400
Mr. Lei,

371
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,760
I went to see Yuzheng today.

372
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,880
He…

373
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,040
He's doing good.

374
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,239
He's just getting a little bored.

375
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I know that the person

376
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,439
he worries about the most is you.

377
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,880
I also told him that

378
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,160
you are doing well too

379
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,640
and waiting for him to come back

380
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,119
and kick his ass.

381
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Mr. Lei,

382
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,959
please get better soon.

383
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,920
If you don't get better,

384
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,040
you may lose Yutian

385
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,199
and Yuzheng would have gone to jail
for nothing.

386
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,880
Please wake up soon.

387
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Let's go and see together.

388
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,280
What's this?

389
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,479
What else can it be?

390
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,599
Isn't it obvious?
(Announcement of Personnel Adjustment)

391
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,040
The guy fired by Mr. Lei

392
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,439
got lucky and
(List of redundant personnel: He Qunfei)

393
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,000
came back.

394
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,560
Now, assistant He is doomed.
(List of redundant personnel: He Qunfei)

395
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,839
Mr. Lin, please tell me

396
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,239
why did you fire me.

397
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,640
The reason is simple.

398
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,000
Yutian is experiencing
many difficulties.

399
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,000
In order to increase the efficiency
within the company,

400
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,400
the board decided to

401
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,359
simplify the company structure
and reduce the number of employees.

402
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,280
Is this reason good enough?

403
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,439
Fine.

404
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
So, is it the board's idea or

405
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,119
your idea?

406
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,839
What's the difference?

407
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,800
Is the job market so rigorous that

408
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,119
you don't want to leave so bad?

409
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,199
You can't decide whether I leave or now.

410
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,560
Mr. Lei should be the one
who decides it.

411
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,520
I knew you would bring Lei Yuzheng up.

412
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,319
Do you think it's okay
to mention him in front of me?

413
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,479
He can't even protect himself now.

414
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,280
How can he possibly
care about other people?

415
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,319
Lin Xiangyuan, I'm warning you.

416
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,199
Don't go too far.

417
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,959
Assistant He,

418
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,319
seriously,

419
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm doing this for your own good.

420
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,719
Even just for the punch I got from you,

421
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,079
it will be impossible for you
to stay at Yutian.

422
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,640
Not to mention that

423
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,239
Yutian is no longer
what it used to be anymore.

424
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,400
It's better for you to

425
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,439
work at somewhere else.

426
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,439
Ok.

427
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
Then, I will go ask the board to decide.

428
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,640
The board?

429
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,079
Do you think that the board
has nothing to do

430
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,680
and they would even care about
such little thing?

431
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,719
If they won't, I will.

432
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,880
Fanlv, why are you here?

433
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,880
I've heard a while ago that Mr. Lin

434
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,479
loves making big moves after promotion,

435
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,479
and you have fired
many loyal employees at Yutian.

436
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,839
And now,

437
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,439
you are chasing He Qunfei away?

438
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,760
It's just career transfer.

439
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,199
And reducing staff is normal
for a company.

440
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,439
I don't care about other people,

441
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
but you cannot fire him.

442
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,800
You can think of it
as I'm pleading for him.

443
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,280
You can take this back.

444
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,199
Fanlv,

445
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,160
you are making this hard for me.

446
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,880
Alright.

447
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,040
Since Mr. Lin is having difficulty,

448
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,680
I have to go ask the board.

449
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I will let Mr. An and uncle Wang

450
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,560
to grant my request.

451
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,319
Let's go.

452
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,000
Wait a second.

453
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,520
Fine.

454
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,280
Let him stay.

455
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,199
Mr. Jiang,

456
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,199
thank you so much today.

457
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,959
You don't need to thank me.

458
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm not doing this for you.

459
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm doing this for brother Yuzheng.

460
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I don't want his people to get affected.

461
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,880
That guy has been really loud
for the whole night.

462
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,280
I'm so sleepy.

463
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,079
Let the boss give him a lesson.

464
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:02,959
What happened yesterday?

465
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,839
Boss, boss.

466
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,000
Who was making so much noise

467
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,239
that I couldn't fall asleep?

468
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,520
Him.

469
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,079
That skinny guy. It's him.

470
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,280
That's the person.

471
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,800
Hey, skinny. You got hurt?

472
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,079
Seems like you've got temper too.

473
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,760
Are your ears beaten to deaf?

474
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,760
I'm talking to you.

475
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,560
You can't hear me, right?

476
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,896
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

477
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,359
Listen,

478
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,439
at this place,

479
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,319
don't go against me, got it?

480
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,479
Who are you?

481
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,479
Who do you think you are?

482
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Are you looking to get beaten?

483
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,640
He's hitting people! Police!
He's hitting people.

484
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:14,520
He's beating people up.

485
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,479
Stop it.

486
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,439
Boss.

487
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,239
Police, he's beating people.

488
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,359
Who started?

489
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,040
He. He started it.

490
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,880
It's him.

491
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,560
Don't you dare keep moving.

492
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,520
Qunfei, you have to help me.

493
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,719
I have to see Lei Yuzheng.

494
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,280
Ok.

495
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:53,019
(Civilized Prison Cell)

496
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,560
Lei Yuzheng,

497
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,479
your subordinate He Qunfei came again.

498
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Go see him.

499
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,319
Captain Liang,

500
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,640
is he by himself?

501
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,719
There's also a girl.

502
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,079
The girl who's been coming here
often to see you

503
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,400
but you kept turning down.

504
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,719
They beg me to not tell you,

505
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,359
but you should go see them.

506
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,640
It's hard for them to keep

507
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,239
visiting here so often.

508
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,560
It's been several times already.

509
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
What happened?

510
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,640
I just had some nose bleeding.
It's not a big deal.

511
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,239
Let's go.

512
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,560
Bro,

513
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,079
how are you?

514
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,199
I'm good.

515
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,599
I said that I don't want to see her.

516
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,199
Why did you bring her here?

517
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,880
Would I be able to see you

518
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,520
otherwise?

519
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,439
Mr. Lei,

520
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,920
you should talk to Xiaosu a little bit.

521
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,280
There's nothing to talk about.

522
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,959
Don't you even have the courage to

523
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,160
hear some words from me?

524
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,199
We all miss you a lot.

525
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,560
Please take care of yourself.

526
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,800
Soon you will be able to get out.

527
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,160
Du Xiaosu,

528
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,719
if you come here just to

529
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,920
tell me these things,

530
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,239
there's no such need.

531
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,479
Lei Yuzheng.

532
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,160
I said that I don't want to see you.

533
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,359
Why would you still come here?

534
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,880
I hate when you act

535
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,280
so self-righteous.

536
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,239
I'm here to see you

537
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,880
because we are friends.

538
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,439
I'm your friend

539
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,239
who just wants to help you
as much as possible.

540
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,319
How do you plan to help me?

541
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,680
You can stay in jail for me

542
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,640
or you can help me fly out of here?

543
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,479
What's more,

544
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,119
I've never helped you.

545
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
Even if I have,

546
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,959
it was an impulsive act,

547
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,800
and you don't need to worry about it.

548
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,280
Regarding "friends",

549
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,599
I'm no longer the leader of Yutian,

550
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,000
and I'm just a prisoner.

551
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,359
Do you want to be friends
with a prisoner?

552
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,599
Lei Yuzheng,

553
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,800
what kind of person do you think I am?

554
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,239
Am I friends with you because of

555
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,439
your fame or social status?

556
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,079
Mr. Lei,

557
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,119
Xiaosu has been really
worried about you.

558
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:30,199
You didn't know it but

559
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,800
she has been running around

560
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,680
for you these days,

561
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,000
and she's pined away.

562
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,239
Du Xiaosu,

563
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,840
stop being mawkish.

564
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,000
Didn't you want to see me as a loser?

565
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,159
Watching a person who used to be proud

566
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,919
to fall to the bottom

567
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,679
like me

568
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
can satisfy your curiosity

569
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,280
and compassion, right?

570
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,719
I know what you are thinking.

571
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:01,040
The once extremely arrogant Lei Yuzheng

572
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,520
is no different than other people

573
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,360
when he has lost everything.

574
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,040
Maybe even worse than other people,

575
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,479
isn't it?

576
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,120
If it can make you feel better

577
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,360
to see me like this,

578
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,760
then say it.

579
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm listening.

580
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,280
Du Xiaosu,

581
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,520
save it.

582
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,239
No matter it's your compassion

583
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,560
or curiosity,

584
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,439
you should be satisfied now.

585
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,280
From now on, please

586
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,080
live your life well

587
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,000
and don't think about me again,

588
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,679
or come here to visit me.

589
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,959
Not to mention caring about me.

590
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,639
Please leave.

591
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,600
Lei Yuzheng,

592
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:54,560
I...

593
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,760
we will wait for you.

594
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,399
Qunfei, you two can have a chat.

595
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,639
I will be outside.

596
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,719
Mr. Lei,

597
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,719
I think you have some misunderstanding
about Xiaosu.

598
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,000
It's been hard for her.

599
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,399
I know that it's been hard for her.

600
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,600
Just because I know it,

601
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,000
I have to push her away.

602
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:46,840
Don't you think that it's too selfish

603
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,080
to waste all her time and effort

604
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,199
on a prisoner?

605
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,919
I don't want to
get her involved in this.

606
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,239
But you took her here anyway,

607
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,159
so I had no choice other than saying
all those words.

608
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:16,639
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

609
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,639
So, I had no choice
other than saying all those words.

610
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:01,919
Bro,

611
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,080
try to think positively.

612
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,959
Women go check on you now

613
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,360
and cry in front of you.

614
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,800
But only few can last long.

615
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,560
I've seen too much.

616
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,639
Don't you want to talk about it?

617
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,199
What do you want to talk about?

618
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,560
You're talking now.

619
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,080
Actually, nothing much.

620
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,679
I just want to know how you got in here.

621
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,280
Financial case.

622
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,040
There're so many kinds of
financial cases.

623
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,120
What kind are you accused of?

624
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,959
Revealing confidential information
of a public company.

625
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,560
How much did you earn

626
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,080
by doing it?

627
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,199
Not a cent.

628
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,239
Then, what did you do it for?

629
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,840
Nothing.

630
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,239
You are so…

631
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,800
It's allowed to light a candle here?

632
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,520
No.

633
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,840
You're violating the prison regulations.

634
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,760
I've always been violating
the prison regulations.

635
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,560
Aren't you afraid that
the police might catch you?

636
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:34,199
So far,

637
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,800
I have never been caught.

638
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,959
What book are you reading?

639
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,800
You wouldn't know even if I tell you.

640
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,000
When Genius Failed

641
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
by Roger Lowenstein.

642
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:59,520
How did know that?

643
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,320
What about this?

644
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,719
The Money Game

645
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,479
by Adam Smith.

646
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,679
Cool.

647
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,560
No wonder they put us together.

648
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,320
