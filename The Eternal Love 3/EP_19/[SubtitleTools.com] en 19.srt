=Episode 19=

16
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,599
For what reason was Prince Consort

17
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,319
on forbidden grounds?

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,560
I'm not sure.

19
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,080
Perhaps my Prince Consort

20
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,200
got lost.

21
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,039
You…

22
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,000
Where did you get this dagger from?

23
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,440
Why? Prince Consort

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
must've accidentally dropped this dagger.

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,119
I'm sure Second Princess

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
knows what the characters on this dagger mean.

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,759
I don't.

28
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,959
No worries if you don't.

29
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,560
Your Highness, just hurry up and make a decision.

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,119
What should I do?

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
Every minute that I waste could result in

32
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,720
Cheng Cheng being in a more dangerous situation.

33
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,920
But I don't even know
if this weirdo is bluffing or not.

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,440
Please take your time, Second Princess.

35
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,920
Either way,

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,239
we're not in a hurry.

37
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,399
I'm not in a hurry.

38
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,879
No.

39
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,160
I can't gamble with Cheng Cheng's life.

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,679
I'll marry him

41
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,080
for Cheng Cheng's sake.

42
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,360
This is not infidelity.

43
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,080
I'll marry him.

44
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,319
And the lost item goes back to its rightful owner.

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,800
Congratulations, Second Princess.

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,479
You now have a main prince consort.

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,640
Xuan Ling.

48
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,840
Who is exactly is Empress?

49
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,879
If I hadn't lost my memories,

50
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,960
maybe I could find out more.

51
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,080
Got to find a way out first.

52
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,999
If the embers move,

53
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,120
that means there's wind from that direction,

54
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,840
where there is wind, there is a way out.

55
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,319
There's wind.

56
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,120
This way.

57
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
Why are your hands shaking?

58
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,240
I've been copying writings for too long.

59
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,439
No need to worry,

60
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,439
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,360
Your hands were fine when you were making tea,

62
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,039
but they're shaking now.

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,719
Perhaps, you cannot

64
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:43,999
bend over?

65
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,719
I've been sitting for too long due to praying.

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
It's no big deal.

67
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
Recently,

68
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,439
there has been a lot of commotion in the palace.

69
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,759
Should I perhaps give those

70
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
with ulterior motives a warning?

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,599
What do you think?

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm merely a man.

73
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,640
I'd never dare to postulate
what Your Majesty is thinking of.

74
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,719
If I let you speak, you should just speak!

75
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
Official Xiao is a highly proficient fighter,

76
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,800
so regular assassins pose no threat.

77
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,719
I was very impressed

78
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,920
by your martial arts

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
and combat skills

80
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,039
at the training grounds before.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,080
Your Majesty, you think too highly of me.

82
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,800
How about you

83
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,279
stand guard for me tonight?

84
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,279
Such great responsibility...

85
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,319
You don't want to do it?

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,439
Such great responsibility,

87
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,999
I'm afraid that I might make mistakes

88
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,680
and disappoint Your Majesty.

89
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm not even afraid.

90
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,759
What are you afraid of?

91
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,680
I humbly accept the order.

92
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,200
Where are you going?

93
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,520
It is inappropriate

94
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
for a man and a woman to be
in a room together, alone.

95
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,599
I will guard the doors.

96
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:40,840
Your Majesty.

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
As soon as Second Princess heard
that Eighth Young Master has been injured,

98
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,120
she agreed to the peace-making marriage.

99
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,719
Your Majesty, if you want someone,

100
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,520
there is no need to do it in such roundabout ways.

101
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Couldn't you just find some reason

102
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
and take him in as part of your harem?

103
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,800
Power cannot bring me true love.

104
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,520
Even then,

105
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,840
if the heart is not broken,

106
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,960
no new love can heal it.

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,599
But Your Majesty,

108
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,800
you mustn't forget about the taboos of your illness.

109
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,559
Having too affectionate feelings can hurt you.

110
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,159
Besides, he went to investigate

111
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:27,479
Altar of Souls in the middle of the night.

112
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,240
He seems to have some ulterior motive.

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,439
We must be wary.

114
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,479
Say,

115
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,640
why did he do so?

116
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,520
Altar of Souls is a forbidden place in the palace.

117
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,120
Since he already coveted power above all,

118
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,400
it is not strange that he went to investigate it.

119
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,559
The point is

120
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,600
who is he investigating it for?

121
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,999
Now that he has turned his back against Mo Yuan Long.

122
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,359
Do you mean it's Second Princess?

123
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,879
Second Princess's odd actions

124
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,960
have been going on for quite some time now.

125
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,520
I've also found

126
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,239
that there's a strange connection

127
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,600
between Second Princess
and the Soul-guarding Bead.

128
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,799
Yesterday, I saw

129
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,160
that Her Highness approached
the Soul-guarding Bead.

130
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,520
I felt a commotion from the Soul-guarding Bead

131
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,999
and Her Highness was covered
by a sudden white light.

132
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,559
Why did you only tell me now?

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,080
I felt that it was very strange indeed,

134
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,799
but I had no concrete evidence.

135
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
It was only a feeling.

136
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,200
If what you speak of is true,

137
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,439
then perhaps

138
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,319
it will be of great help to our grand plan.

139
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:35,879
Today is the day

140
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,319
she marries her new prince consort.

141
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,720
You know what to do, right?

142
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:40,879
Understood, Your Majesty.

143
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,439
Tan.

144
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,280
Tan.

145
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,239
Tan.

146
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,439
You can't avoid

147
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,119
going to the newlywed chamber forever...

148
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,799
You have to talk to Prince Consort.

149
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,799
If Prince Consort

150
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,119
were to speak poorly of you in front of Her Majesty,

151
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,999
more punishments will come your way.

152
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:27,999
I'm busy.

153
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,319
Second Princess!

154
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,559
Fourteenth!

155
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,040
Fourteenth.

156
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,559
How's your Eighth Brother?

157
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,520
Is he alright?

158
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,919
Did Her Majesty

159
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,720
force him to do things he didn't want to?

160
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,200
Hurry, speak up.

161
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,119
Don't you talk a lot normally?

162
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,239
Eighth Brother...

163
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,720
What?

164
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,280
Eighth Brother went to
Her Majesty's bedchamber last night

165
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
and hasn't come back yet.

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,879
I heard Her Majesty

167
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,319
gifted Eighth Brother with lots of
new clothing and gifts.

168
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,759
Is that true?

169
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
Was it against his will?

170
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,919
It probably...

171
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,799
wasn't...

172
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,919
Mo Lian Cheng, you bastard!

173
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,919
I had to marry another man to protect you

174
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,720
and you went off to the palace

175
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,239
to be all lovey-dovey with Her Majesty.

176
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
You freaking bastard!

177
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,200
The head of the palace guards, Official Xiao,
has come to congratulate you.

178
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,960
Congratulations, Your Highness.

179
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,840
Her Majesty hereby gifts you a pair of golden locks,

180
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,999
a pair of jade ware,

181
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:37,600
wishing Your Highness
and Prince Consort a happy marriage.

182
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,119
I do thank Her Majesty.

183
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,080
Jing Xin,

184
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,119
let's go out for a walk.

185
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,759
Second Princess, please wait.

186
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,119
By Her Majesty's order,

187
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,879
to ensure the continuation of the royal bloodline,

188
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,319
Second Princess,

189
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,960
please remain in Prince Consort's chamber tonight.

190
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,400
The newlywed chamber is this way.

191
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,080
Well, you are quite familiar

192
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
with the layout of my residence, aren't you?

193
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,480
I want to go change into sexier clothing,

194
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,080
can I not?

195
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,040
I will wait for Your Highness quietly

196
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,799
outside the room.

197
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,359
Who designed this room?

198
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,319
So red, so out of style.

199
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,480
Take everything down!

200
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,640
Nothing is going right today.

201
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,480
Although Cheng Cheng is safe for now,

202
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Her Majesty,

203
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,559
despite knowing he entered forbidden grounds,

204
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,080
did not punish him

205
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,520
after she called him to her bedchamber.

206
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
She even gifted him gifts.

207
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,679
Tan.

208
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,280
Prince Consort is very intelligent.

209
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,319
He will for sure find a way out of the situation.

210
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,919
Jing Xin,

211
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,359
everyone knows what Her Majesty
is thinking about.

212
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,960
It's not something one can
get out of with persuasion alone.

213
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,439
Then even if so...

214
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:13,840
Even if so,

215
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,600
Prince Consort was forced.

216
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
That's right.

217
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,759
He was forced.

218
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,359
I'm not mad at him.

219
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm not mad at him at all.

220
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,359
That's right.

221
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,280
If I get upset, I lose.

222
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,359
Even if

223
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,520
Her Majesty kept him in her bedchamber

224
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
and gifted him gifts,

225
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,280
can't he just reject her for once?

226
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,919
I'm so mad right now.

227
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,720
Just wait till he comes back.

228
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,040
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

229
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Second Princess.

230
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,280
All of you, get out!

231
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm here diligently keeping my chastity

232
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,400
and he's there flirting with others.

233
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
An eye for an eye

234
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,679
and a tooth for...

235
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,200
Well, I can't.

236
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,119
Not all men are like him.

237
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,840
You barging in like that

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,600
is against proper etiquette, isn't it?

239
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:17,919
When I thought

240
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,600
that perhaps I can help
solve Your Highness's problem,

241
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,160
I couldn't care about any etiquette.

242
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,799
Don't go.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,319
Jing Xin.

244
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,559
Don't you dare...

245
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,040
You...

246
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,239
Come back.

247
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,879
You must've heard me wrong.

248
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm absolutely fine.

249
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,239
There are no problems for you to solve.

250
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,200
That's good then.

251
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,720
You should be enjoying yourself

252
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,679
on your wedding night.

253
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,840
Even though you've saved me before,

254
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,799
I only think of you as a comrade.

255
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,600
What are you doing?

256
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:10,999
Don't come any closer!

257
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Tonight,

258
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,559
I'm staying for sure.

259
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,200
What are you doing?

260
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,520
Let go of me!

261
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,759
Let go of me!

262
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
Let go!

263
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,640
Official Xiao.

264
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,640
Her Majesty knows that standing guard at night
must've been hard work for Eighth Young Master,

265
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,559
so Her Majesty has gifted you some tonic

266
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,679
that will be delivered to your residence later.

267
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,879
How can standing guard at night

268
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,160
for Her Majesty be called hard work?

269
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,600
I heard

270
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,319
that heavy rain has suddenly hit the south,

271
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,879
alleviating the drought.

272
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,319
It would seem that the praying has worked,

273
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,239
Her Majesty's grace has touched the heavens.

274
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,520
And recently,

275
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,879
the situation in the palace has become tense,

276
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
Second Princess's Residence

277
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,319
must require managing.

278
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,879
Eighth Young Master, would you like to return?

279
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,559
I am afraid

280
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,879
that the residence will be a mess,

281
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,799
which would damage the royal family's reputation.

282
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,960
Her Majesty has agreed.

283
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,720
I

284
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
thank Her Majesty.

285
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,239
Actually, these days,

286
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,999
Her Majesty has been keeping you
at the palace for another reason.

287
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,999
Things at Second Princess's Residence

288
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,799
have been a little complicated.

289
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:25,960
Last night,

290
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,679
a new prince consort married into the residence.

291
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,919
Prince consort?

292
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,119
Hurry back to greet Prince Consort.

293
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,200
This way, Second Princess can stop worrying.

294
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,600
There's no need to worry, Official Xiao.

295
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,439
If it was Princess's decision,

296
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,720
I

297
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
will certainly respect it.

298
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:05,883
(Mo Residence)

299
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,840
Father.

300
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,439
Have you heard

301
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,720
that Second Princess married for
peace-making last night?

302
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,840
I have faced the one who came

303
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,319
for peace-making marriage, Yun Xiu, in battle.

304
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,880
He is quite cunning.

305
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
This peace-marriage

306
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,319
may not be as simple as it seems.

307
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,600
The peace-making marriage was sudden,

308
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,399
Her Majesty may have other reasons.

309
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,880
It would be best to just wait and see.

310
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,000
But if something is really off with Yun Xiu,

311
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,360
not only Eighth Brother
and the Mo family will be implicated,

312
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,039
the entire Dongyue may be threatened.

313
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,760
The situation is still unclear,

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,120
we must not act rashly.

315
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
I must investigate.

316
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,679
I will only act

317
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,760
after I find evidence.

318
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,399
At a time like this,

319
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,679
you must be even more careful.

320
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,360
Don't worry, Father. I understand.

321
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,559
Her Majesty's move this time,

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
is it to balance the power

323
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
or does she have other intentions?

324
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,000
To congratulate Your Highness on
marrying a new prince consort,

325
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,960
I have prepared a small gift

326
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,919
as a token of my congratulations.

327
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,000
General, you are too kind.

328
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,000
It seems Prince Consort is too used to
fighting on the battlefield.

329
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,399
Since you have come to Dongyue,

330
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,760
you must abide by Dongyue's rules,

331
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,679
as to not implicate Princess in the future.

332
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,679
He had just arrived,

333
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:51,639
so he is unfamiliar with everything.

334
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,120
But

335
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,559
men who do not bother with trifle details

336
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,240
are the most charismatic.

337
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,679
As such,

338
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,159
how about let my subordinates bring these gifts

339
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,679
into Prince Consort's chambers

340
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
according to Dongyue's rules,

341
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,799
as to not have mistakes happen?

342
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,880
General, do you care about rules

343
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,319
or are you suspicious of me?

344
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:12,679
I am just trying to be considerate,

345
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
how did it turn into suspicion?

346
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,399
General, you mean to be considerate.

347
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,480
However,

348
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,720
if those who like to gossip

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,919
turn this into that you lust after Prince Consort,

350
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,880
making excuses to barge into his boudoir,

351
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,799
wouldn't that be terrible?

352
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,080
I do not lust after men,

353
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,559
how is it possible that...

354
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,559
So rumours like that must not exist.

355
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,120
Prince Consort is indeed

356
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,399
striking

357
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:35,559
and easy to fall for.

358
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,279
I also believe

359
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,919
that you just misspoke.

360
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,519
It is impossible that you

361
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,880
have any improper intentions.

362
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,519
Second Princess, you repeatedly spoke up for him,

363
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,880
it seems that you do like him.

364
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,559
I must remind Your Highness,

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,319
time will reveal a person's heart,

366
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,519
be careful to not trust the wrong man.

367
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,000
This is not the borders,

368
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,399
why are you still so aggressive towards Yun Xiu?

369
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,039
You know the reason better than I do.

370
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,039
Your Highness, please allow me
to bring the gifts inside.

371
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:04,760
But

372
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,439
barging into a man's boudoir

373
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,080
is indeed improper.

374
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,639
General, if you

375
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:11,360
are really suspicious of Yun Xiu,

376
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,960
why don't you stay over
at my residence for a while?

377
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:15,559
If you

378
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,000
really do find something,

379
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,840
I'm certain neither Her Majesty nor I

380
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,960
will be lenient.

381
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,480
Your Highness, since you say so,

382
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,639
I will do as you say.

383
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:29,720
Of course.

384
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,639
Jing Xin,

385
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,080
please arrange for General's stay.

386
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:33,159
Okay.

387
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,399
General Mo,

388
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,360
please come with me.

389
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,978
(Princess's Residence)

390
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,600
What happened?

391
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,840
The new prince consort,

392
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,000
with a thud,

393
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:03,519
pushed the door open,

394
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,600
picked Her Highness up

395
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,639
and headed towards the bed.

396
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,279
Who wouldn't love such a man?

397
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:08,919
No wonder

398
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,240
Princess likes him more
compared to the previous two.

399
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,600
Bold of you to gossip about the master of this house.

400
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,519
Are you seeking death?

401
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,760
Forgive us, Prince Consort. We have made a mistake.

402
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,080
Where is Princess?

403
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,120
Her Highness is

404
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,760
in the new prince consort's chamber.

405
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,639
Prince Consort.

406
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,639
What is it?

407
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,600
Princess said

408
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,200
no one is to disturb her

409
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:31,799
when she's in Main Prince Consort's chamber.

410
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:42,960
Young Master,

411
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,360
do you think

412
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Princess may have run into
some unspeakable difficulties?

413
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,279
Check it out for me.

414
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:51,399
If you hear anything,

415
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:52,240
report to me anytime.

416
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,279
Understood.

417
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,880
You look so beautiful today.

418
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,679
Since when did Princess

419
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,840
learn to be shy?

420
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,679
You're not giving me an explanation on
why you stayed over at your ex-girlfriend's

421
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,279
and you still appear so righteous?

422
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,159
Which girl wouldn't be shy

423
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,200
when they're together with the person they like?

424
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,519
Is that all

425
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,600
you wanted to tell me?

426
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,720
I should be the one

427
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,439
asking Your Highness that.

428
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,360
Still so stubborn.

429
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,399
You've already been back for a while.

430
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,399
Why haven't you greeted Main Prince Consort?

431
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,840
Greetings

432
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,039
should be done in the morning.

433
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,000
Now that the morning has passed,

434
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,319
it would be disrespectful to do my greetings.

435
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,840
A load of rubbish, all excuses!

436
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Why,

437
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
Your Highness, do you want me to show disrespect

438
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,000
to Main Prince Consort

439
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,080
on my first day?

440
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,480
Your Highness,

441
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,639
don't get angry.

442
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,679
In any case,

443
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,039
we'll have more opportunities in the future.

444
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,120
You're right, Prince Consort.

445
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,679
Next time, once it reaches the morning,

446
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,439
you will need to go and greet Yun Xiu.

447
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,279
Let's go.

448
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,399
Princess, Prince Consort.

449
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,559
Young Master, Young Master.

450
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,679
Previously,

451
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,319
General Feng Yang and Prince Consort

452
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,799
had a confrontation.

453
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,559
General thinks that he's suspicious.

454
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,919
In order to calm things down,

455
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,919
Princess arranged for her to stay
in the guest room of our residence.

456
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:37,200
Let's go take a look.

457
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,279
Feng Yang.

458
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,039
Eighth Brother.

459
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,720
Our situation now

460
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,960
is what you get for trying to oust Eldest Brother.

461
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,080
Since you're willing to stay at the residence,

462
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,919
I'm sure you have the same thoughts as me.

463
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
There has been foul play

464
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,480
in this peace-making marriage.

465
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,639
That's what I want to investigate,

466
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,840
as long as you don't cause trouble.

467
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,840
As a woman,

468
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,240
it'll be difficult for you to enter a man's boudoir.

469
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,439
But I

470
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,559
can help you.

471
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,200
Under what conditions?

472
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,840
Tell me

473
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,200
what kind of person Yun Xiu is.

474
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,559
How will men be able to understand

475
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,319
what happens on the battlefield?

476
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,240
Why don't you try?

477
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,360
Although Yun Xiu is a man,

478
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,279
he was awarded the rank of a general
because he is of noble descent.

479
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,399
He has been guarding the border
between Dongyue and West Yue.

480
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,200
The situation suddenly got tense last year,

481
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,720
and he deliberately ordered
for the troops to draw back.

482
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,600
Tell me,

483
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,399
why do you think he did that?

484
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,679
The Empty City stratagem.

485
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
When the situation escalated,

486
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,240
the armies of both sides were in a deadlock,

487
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,679
he deliberately sent soldiers to negotiate.

488
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,639
Why was that?

489
00:24:59,279 --> 00:24:59,720
A fake surrender.

490
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,439
Yun Xiu is full of tricks.

491
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,799
He even tried to launch sneak attacks at night.

492
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,159
Thankfully my army was well-prepared

493
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:05,519
and we were victorious.

494
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,519
Therefore,

495
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,240
this peace-making marriage

496
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,159
is definitely not simple.

497
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,120
I'll find an opportunity

498
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
to search his room

499
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,399
and find some leads.

500
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,799
Be careful.

501
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:43,919
Where is she?

502
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:47,360
Prince Consort.

503
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,720
Where's Second Princess?

504
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:49,760
She should be

505
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
in Main Prince Consort's chamber.

506
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,439
I will take my leave.

507
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,559
Spending the night in the imperial bedchamber...

508
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,439
I'll give you a taste of how I felt.

509
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,799
Upsetting you like this

510
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,360
isn't considered going overboard, right?

and I'll believe you a billion times.

521
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,799
But you won't even say a word.

522
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,039
And it seems like

523
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,200
you're intentionally out to upset me.

(Princess's Residence)

527
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,760
Secondary Prince Consort, why are you

528
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,519
barging into my room?

529
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,880
Attacking me without first
seeking an explanation,

530
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,880
is that how Xiyue taught you to behave?

531
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,120
Is sneaking around

532
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,960
a habit of Dongyue's men?

533
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,399
Why are you fighting so early in the morning?

534
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,480
Yun Xiu's skills

535
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
are pretty awesome though.

536
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,000
Princess,

537
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,399
ask him

538
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,319
what he was trying to do,

539
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,279
breaking into my room early in the morning.

540
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,919
I felt apologetic for offending
Prince Consort yesterday.

541
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,960
I came to clean Prince Consort's room
to make up for it.

542
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,319
But Prince Consort attacked me
without first figuring out the situation.

543
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,200
So I ended up fighting with Prince Consort.

544
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,960
I see.

545
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,559
So you wanted to give expiation.

546
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,000
I have a good idea.

547
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
Don't you have some nice things from your dowry

548
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,600
that you can give to Prince Consort

549
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,799
to prepare?

550
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,080
Let Yun Xiu teach you how to prepare lunch

551
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:19,840
and make

552
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,279
Xiyue nut cake

553
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,840
to make up

554
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,279
for your mistake.

555
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,319
Okay.

556
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,679
Speed things up.

557
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,760
Put those

558
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,360
walnuts, dates

559
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,360
raisins and Chinese wolfberries all in.

560
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,679
Move faster.

561
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,960
Princess.

562
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,120
Have a taste.

563
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,559
This aroma

564
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,639
is just soul-stirring.

565
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,439
This Xiyue nut cake

566
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,880
looks sweet, soft, glutinous,
smells and tastes delicious.

567
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,639
It is worthy to be

568
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,360
on "A Bite of Xiyue".
["A Bite of China" is a documentary on Chinese cuisine]

569
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,600
Can "soul-stirring" be used

570
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,720
to describe aroma?

571
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:26,720
Look at you.

572
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,840
Your actions are chaotic,
you're unfamiliar with the procedures,

573
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,200
and your service is terrible.

574
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,760
I think you are

575
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,360
on the verge of being repudiated.

576
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,960
Yun Xiu.

577
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:38,919
Feed me.

578
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,840
You...

579
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,960
What?

580
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm afraid Your Highness will choke to death.

581
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,880
Are you feeding a cow?

582
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:54,760
Princess.

583
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,120
Princess.

584
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,439
It's time for me to bring General Mo her lunch.

585
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,200
Great timing.

586
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,120
Yun Xiu,

587
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,000
bring her the nut cake

588
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,600
that you made yourself.

589
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,200
Okay.

590
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,480
Didn't I make it?

591
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,399
Princess and I taught you how.

592
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,760
You...

593
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,639
He seems

594
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,039
very satisfied with the way you're doing things.

595
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,639
Yun Xiu and I are of one mind,

596
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,919
of course he's satisfied.

597
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm saying

598
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
that compared to staying here,

599
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,720
he wants to go find Feng Yang more.

600
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,399
Stop trying to change the topic.

601
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,159
Jing Xin. Jing Xin.

602
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,919
What are you doing?

603
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,399
Comparing sizes.

604
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,200
I wouldn't want you and Prince Consort

605
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,319
to both choke to death.

606
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,639
Lord of Jealousy

607
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,760
turned green-eyed all of a sudden.

608
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:22,919
You...

609
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,200
I just made these. Have a taste.

610
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,639
Prince Consort, you are very skilled at cooking,

611
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,880
but I'm not hungry right now.

612
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,399
General, you needn't be so impatient.

613
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,159
I just didn't want to trouble you,

614
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,119
I had no other intentions.

615
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,040
Use the cloth.

616
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,760
This is to tell me that he didn't
put poison in them.

617
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,839
Innocent on the outside,

618
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,439
he must have ulterior motives.

619
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,000
He's coming, he's coming.

620
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,879
Here.

621
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,919
How is it? Does it taste good?

622
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,119
Don't move.

623
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,320
You got something on your face,

624
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,760
let me get it for you.

625
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,280
Your Highness, when do you start liking

626
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,879
hairy men?

627
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,839
I've completely forgotten about that.

628
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,040
Love can really

629
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,399
change a person quietly.

630
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,000
Stand by.

631
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,079
Serve us tea.

632
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,720
Here, Yun Xiu,

633
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,879
have some more.

634
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,839
Have an orange.

635
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,200
- I'll peel it for you. I'll peel it.
- I'll do it.

636
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,560
- Let me.
- Let me.

637
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,040
When did the rules change?

638
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,560
The concubine shouldn't eat

639
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
at the same table as us to begin with.

640
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,240
Before,

641
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,560
I spoiled you too much.

642
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,040
Issuing an order in the morning
and rescinding it in the evening,

643
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,200
it's unconvincing.

644
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,040
Fine.

645
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,280
What do you think, Main Prince Consort?

646
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,560
What do you think?

647
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,439
Excellent.

648
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,320
This way,

649
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,040
no one disagrees.

650
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,800
Yun Xiu.

651
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
What Yun Xiu feeds me

652
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,960
tastes so good.

653
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Are you not hungry?

654
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,079
If you're not,

655
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,320
practice your swordsmanship outside.

656
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,240
Okay.

657
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
I'll practice with you.

658
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,960
When you have an opponent,

659
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,280
you can test your true powers.

660
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,200
That depends on whether
you're worthy of being my opponent.

661
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,839
Why aren't you attacking?

662
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,240
I don't want to hurt you.

663
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,639
No need to worry.

664
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
You think too much.

665
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,520
Did you let him

666
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,079
train with Mo Feng Yang on purpose?

667
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,560
No.

668
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,720
Aren't you staying over at Yun Xiu's?

669
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,040
What are you doing in Snow Court?

670
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,119
No hurry.

671
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,320
Regardless of what happens,

672
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,639
Yun Xiu will wait for me.

673
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,919
Why do you keep

674
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:13,639
trying to upset me?

675
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,599
You're allowed to be unwilling to leave
the imperial bedchamber,

676
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,079
but I'm not allowed to do PDA?

677
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,079
I was trapped in the palace,
I couldn't decide my own actions.

678
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,480
Where did the "unwilling to leave" come from?

679
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,639
Not being able to decide your own actions

680
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,520
allows you to stay over at Her Majesty's
bedchamber for the entire night?

681
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,639
Why did Her Majesty gift you so many things

682
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,439
while you did nothing?

683
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,599
So this is the reason

684
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,159
you've been trying to upset me on purpose.

685
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,679
Then everything with Yun Xiu

686
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,200
has all been an act?

687
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,480
That's not why.

688
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,079
Yun Xiu and I have a bond as strong as gold.

689
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,720
It's not because of this?

690
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,879
Then it's because

691
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,079
I didn't give you half

692
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,679
of what Her Majesty gifted me.

693
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,480
Who cares about your shitty gifts?

694
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
Jing Xin's idea is terrible.

695
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:07,720
Not telling her the truth isn't a bad idea.

696
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:09,720
This way, I won't wake a sleeping wolf.

697
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,040
I'll explain everything

698
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,919
once I find out all

699
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,439
about Yun Xiu's secrets.

700
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:17,800
Also,

701
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,919
she looks quite cute

702
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,960
