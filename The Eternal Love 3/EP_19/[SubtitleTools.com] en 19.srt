16
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,199
For what reason was Prince Consort

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,919
on forbidden grounds?

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm not sure.

19
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,680
Perhaps my Prince Consort

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,800
got lost.

21
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,639
You…

22
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,600
Where did you get this dagger from?

23
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,040
Why? Prince Consort

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,960
must've accidentally dropped this dagger.

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,719
I'm sure Second Princess

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
knows what the characters on this dagger mean.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,359
I don't.

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,559
No worries if you don't.

29
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,160
Your Highness, just hurry up and make a decision.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,719
What should I do?

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Every minute that I waste could result in

32
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,320
Cheng Cheng being in a more dangerous situation.

33
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,520
But I don't even know
if this weirdo is bluffing or not.

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,040
Please take your time, Second Princess.

35
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,520
Either way,

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,839
we're not in a hurry.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,999
I'm not in a hurry.

38
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,479
No.

39
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,760
I can't gamble with Cheng Cheng's life.

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,279
I'll marry him

41
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,680
for Cheng Cheng's sake.

42
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,960
This is not infidelity.

43
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,680
I'll marry him.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,919
And the lost item goes back to its rightful owner.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,400
Congratulations, Second Princess.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,079
You now have a main prince consort.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
Xuan Ling.

48
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,440
Who is exactly is Empress?

49
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,479
If I hadn't lost my memories,

50
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,560
maybe I could find out more.

51
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:18,680
Got to find a way out first.

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,599
If the embers move,

53
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,720
that means there's wind from that direction,

54
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,440
where there is wind, there is a way out.

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,919
There's wind.

56
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,720
This way.

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
Why are your hands shaking?

58
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,840
I've been copying writings for too long.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,039
No need to worry,

60
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,039
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,960
Your hands were fine when you were making tea,

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,639
but they're shaking now.

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,319
Perhaps, you cannot

64
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,599
bend over?

65
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,319
I've been sitting for too long due to praying.

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,400
It's no big deal.

67
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,120
Recently,

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,039
there has been a lot of commotion in the palace.

69
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,359
Should I perhaps give those

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,840
with ulterior motives a warning?

71
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,199
What do you think?

72
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm merely a man.

73
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,240
I'd never dare to postulate
what Your Majesty is thinking of.

74
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,319
If I let you speak, you should just speak!

75
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,720
Official Xiao is a highly proficient fighter,

76
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
so regular assassins pose no threat.

77
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,319
I was very impressed

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
by your martial arts

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,000
and combat skills

80
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,639
at the training grounds before.

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,680
Your Majesty, you think too highly of me.

82
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,400
How about you

83
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,879
stand guard for me tonight?

84
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,879
Such great responsibility...

85
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,919
You don't want to do it?

86
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,039
Such great responsibility,

87
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,599
I'm afraid that I might make mistakes

88
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,280
and disappoint Your Majesty.

89
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,680
I'm not even afraid.

90
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,359
What are you afraid of?

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,280
I humbly accept the order.

92
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,800
Where are you going?

93
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
It is inappropriate

94
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
for a man and a woman to be
in a room together, alone.

95
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,199
I will guard the doors.

96
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,440
Your Majesty.

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
As soon as Second Princess heard
that Eighth Young Master has been injured,

98
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,720
she agreed to the peace-making marriage.

99
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,319
Your Majesty, if you want someone,

100
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,120
there is no need to do it in such roundabout ways.

101
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,400
Couldn't you just find some reason

102
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,079
and take him in as part of your harem?

103
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,400
Power cannot bring me true love.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
Even then,

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,440
if the heart is not broken,

106
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,560
no new love can heal it.

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,199
But Your Majesty,

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,400
you mustn't forget about the taboos of your illness.

109
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,159
Having too affectionate feelings can hurt you.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,759
Besides, he went to investigate

111
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,079
Altar of Souls in the middle of the night.

112
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,840
He seems to have some ulterior motive.

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,039
We must be wary.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,079
Say,

115
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,240
why did he do so?

116
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Altar of Souls is a forbidden place in the palace.

117
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,720
Since he already coveted power above all,

118
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,000
it is not strange that he went to investigate it.

119
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,159
The point is

120
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,200
who is he investigating it for?

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,599
Now that he has turned his back against Mo Yuan Long.

122
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,959
Do you mean it's Second Princess?

123
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,479
Second Princess's odd actions

124
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,560
have been going on for quite some time now.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
I've also found

126
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,839
that there's a strange connection

127
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,200
between Second Princess
and the Soul-guarding Bead.

128
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,399
Yesterday, I saw

129
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,760
that Her Highness approached
the Soul-guarding Bead.

130
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,120
I felt a commotion from the Soul-guarding Bead

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,599
and Her Highness was covered
by a sudden white light.

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,159
Why did you only tell me now?

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,680
I felt that it was very strange indeed,

134
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,399
but I had no concrete evidence.

135
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,800
It was only a feeling.

136
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,800
If what you speak of is true,

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,039
then perhaps

138
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,919
it will be of great help to our grand plan.

139
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:07,479
Today is the day

140
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,919
she marries her new prince consort.

141
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,320
You know what to do, right?

142
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,479
Understood, Your Majesty.

143
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,039
Tan.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,880
Tan.

145
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,839
Tan.

146
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,039
You can't avoid

147
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,719
going to the newlywed chamber forever...

148
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,399
You have to talk to Prince Consort.

149
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,399
If Prince Consort

150
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,719
were to speak poorly of you in front of Her Majesty,

151
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,599
more punishments will come your way.

152
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,599
I'm busy.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,919
Second Princess!

154
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,159
Fourteenth!

155
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Fourteenth.

156
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,159
How's your Eighth Brother?

157
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
Is he alright?

158
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,519
Did Her Majesty

159
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,320
force him to do things he didn't want to?

160
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,800
Hurry, speak up.

161
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,719
Don't you talk a lot normally?

162
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,839
Eighth Brother...

163
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,320
What?

164
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,880
Eighth Brother went to
Her Majesty's bedchamber last night

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,240
and hasn't come back yet.

166
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,479
I heard Her Majesty

167
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,919
gifted Eighth Brother with lots of
new clothing and gifts.

168
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,359
Is that true?

169
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
Was it against his will?

170
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,519
It probably...

171
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,399
wasn't...

172
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,519
Mo Lian Cheng, you bastard!

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,519
I had to marry another man to protect you

174
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,320
and you went off to the palace

175
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,839
to be all lovey-dovey with Her Majesty.

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
You freaking bastard!

177
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,800
The head of the palace guards, Official Xiao,
has come to congratulate you.

178
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,560
Congratulations, Your Highness.

179
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,440
Her Majesty hereby gifts you a pair of golden locks,

180
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,599
a pair of jade ware,

181
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,200
wishing Your Highness
and Prince Consort a happy marriage.

182
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,719
I do thank Her Majesty.

183
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,680
Jing Xin,

184
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,719
let's go out for a walk.

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,359
Second Princess, please wait.

186
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,719
By Her Majesty's order,

187
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,479
to ensure the continuation of the royal bloodline,

188
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:23,919
Second Princess,

189
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,560
please remain in Prince Consort's chamber tonight.

190
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
The newlywed chamber is this way.

191
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,680
Well, you are quite familiar

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,800
with the layout of my residence, aren't you?

193
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,080
I want to go change into sexier clothing,

194
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,680
can I not?

195
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,640
I will wait for Your Highness quietly

196
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,399
outside the room.

197
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,959
Who designed this room?

198
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,919
So red, so out of style.

199
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,080
Take everything down!

200
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,240
Nothing is going right today.

201
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,080
Although Cheng Cheng is safe for now,

202
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Her Majesty,

203
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,159
despite knowing he entered forbidden grounds,

204
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
did not punish him

205
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,120
after she called him to her bedchamber.

206
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
She even gifted him gifts.

207
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,279
Tan.

208
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,880
Prince Consort is very intelligent.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,919
He will for sure find a way out of the situation.

210
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,519
Jing Xin,

211
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,959
everyone knows what Her Majesty
is thinking about.

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,560
It's not something one can
get out of with persuasion alone.

213
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,039
Then even if so...

214
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,440
Even if so,

215
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:48,200
Prince Consort was forced.

216
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
That's right.

217
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,359
He was forced.

218
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,959
I'm not mad at him.

219
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm not mad at him at all.

220
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,959
That's right.

221
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,880
If I get upset, I lose.

222
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,959
Even if

223
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,120
Her Majesty kept him in her bedchamber

224
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
and gifted him gifts,

225
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,880
can't he just reject her for once?

226
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,519
I'm so mad right now.

227
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,320
Just wait till he comes back.

228
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,640
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Second Princess.

230
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,880
All of you, get out!

231
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,080
I'm here diligently keeping my chastity

232
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,000
and he's there flirting with others.

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,560
An eye for an eye

234
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,279
and a tooth for...

235
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,800
Well, I can't.

236
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,719
Not all men are like him.

237
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,440
You barging in like that

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,200
is against proper etiquette, isn't it?

239
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,519
When I thought

240
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,200
that perhaps I can help
solve Your Highness's problem,

241
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,760
I couldn't care about any etiquette.

242
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,399
Don't go.

243
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,919
Jing Xin.

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,159
Don't you dare...

245
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:12,640
You...

246
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,839
Come back.

247
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,479
You must've heard me wrong.

248
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm absolutely fine.

249
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
There are no problems for you to solve.

250
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,800
That's good then.

251
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,320
You should be enjoying yourself

252
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,279
on your wedding night.

253
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,440
Even though you've saved me before,

254
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
I only think of you as a comrade.

255
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,200
What are you doing?

256
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,599
Don't come any closer!

257
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,320
Tonight,

258
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,159
I'm staying for sure.

259
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,800
What are you doing?

260
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,120
Let go of me!

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,359
Let go of me!

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,240
Let go!

263
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,240
Official Xiao.

264
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,240
Her Majesty knows that standing guard at night
must've been hard work for Eighth Young Master,

265
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,159
so Her Majesty has gifted you some tonic

266
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,279
that will be delivered to your residence later.

267
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,479
How can standing guard at night

268
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,760
for Her Majesty be called hard work?

269
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,200
I heard

270
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,919
that heavy rain has suddenly hit the south,

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,479
alleviating the drought.

272
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,919
It would seem that the praying has worked,

273
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,839
Her Majesty's grace has touched the heavens.

274
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,120
And recently,

275
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,479
the situation in the palace has become tense,

276
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,880
Second Princess's Residence

277
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,919
must require managing.

278
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,479
Eighth Young Master, would you like to return?

279
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,159
I am afraid

280
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,479
that the residence will be a mess,

281
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,399
which would damage the royal family's reputation.

282
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Her Majesty has agreed.

283
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
I

284
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,800
thank Her Majesty.

285
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,839
Actually, these days,

286
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,599
Her Majesty has been keeping you
at the palace for another reason.

287
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,599
Things at Second Princess's Residence

288
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,399
have been a little complicated.

289
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,560
Last night,

290
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,279
a new prince consort married into the residence.

291
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,519
Prince consort?

292
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,719
Hurry back to greet Prince Consort.

293
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,800
This way, Second Princess can stop worrying.

294
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,200
There's no need to worry, Official Xiao.

295
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,039
If it was Princess's decision,

296
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,320
I

297
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
will certainly respect it.

298
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:37,483
(Mo Residence)

299
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,440
Father.

300
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,039
Have you heard

301
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,320
that Second Princess married for
peace-making last night?

302
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,440
I have faced the one who came

303
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,919
for peace-making marriage, Yun Xiu, in battle.

304
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,480
He is quite cunning.

305
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
This peace-marriage

306
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,919
may not be as simple as it seems.

307
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,200
The peace-making marriage was sudden,

308
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,999
Her Majesty may have other reasons.

309
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,480
It would be best to just wait and see.

310
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,600
But if something is really off with Yun Xiu,

311
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,960
not only Eighth Brother
and the Mo family will be implicated,

312
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,639
the entire Dongyue may be threatened.

313
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,360
The situation is still unclear,

314
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,720
we must not act rashly.

315
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
I must investigate.

316
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,279
I will only act

317
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,360
after I find evidence.

318
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:27,999
At a time like this,

319
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,279
you must be even more careful.

320
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,960
Don't worry, Father. I understand.

321
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,159
Her Majesty's move this time,

322
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,840
is it to balance the power

323
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,440
or does she have other intentions?

324
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,600
To congratulate Your Highness on
marrying a new prince consort,

325
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,560
I have prepared a small gift

326
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,519
as a token of my congratulations.

327
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,600
General, you are too kind.

328
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,600
It seems Prince Consort is too used to
fighting on the battlefield.

329
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,999
Since you have come to Dongyue,

330
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,360
you must abide by Dongyue's rules,

331
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,279
as to not implicate Princess in the future.

332
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,279
He had just arrived,

333
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,239
so he is unfamiliar with everything.

334
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:24,720
But

335
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,159
men who do not bother with trifle details

336
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,840
are the most charismatic.

337
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,279
As such,

338
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,759
how about let my subordinates bring these gifts

339
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,279
into Prince Consort's chambers

340
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,360
according to Dongyue's rules,

341
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,399
as to not have mistakes happen?

342
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,480
General, do you care about rules

343
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,919
or are you suspicious of me?

344
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,279
I am just trying to be considerate,

345
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,680
how did it turn into suspicion?

346
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,999
General, you mean to be considerate.

347
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,080
However,

348
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,320
if those who like to gossip

349
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,519
turn this into that you lust after Prince Consort,

350
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,480
making excuses to barge into his boudoir,

351
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,399
wouldn't that be terrible?

352
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,680
I do not lust after men,

353
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,159
how is it possible that...

354
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,159
So rumours like that must not exist.

355
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,720
Prince Consort is indeed

356
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,999
striking

357
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,159
and easy to fall for.

358
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,879
I also believe

359
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,519
that you just misspoke.

360
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,119
It is impossible that you

361
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,480
have any improper intentions.

362
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,119
Second Princess, you repeatedly spoke up for him,

363
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,480
it seems that you do like him.

364
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,159
I must remind Your Highness,

365
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,919
time will reveal a person's heart,

366
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,119
be careful to not trust the wrong man.

367
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
This is not the borders,

368
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,999
why are you still so aggressive towards Yun Xiu?

369
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,639
You know the reason better than I do.

370
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,639
Your Highness, please allow me
to bring the gifts inside.

371
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,360
But

372
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,039
barging into a man's boudoir

373
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,680
is indeed improper.

374
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,239
General, if you

375
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,960
are really suspicious of Yun Xiu,

376
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,560
why don't you stay over
at my residence for a while?

377
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,159
If you

378
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,600
really do find something,

379
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm certain neither Her Majesty nor I

380
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,560
will be lenient.

381
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,080
Your Highness, since you say so,

382
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,239
I will do as you say.

383
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,320
Of course.

384
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,239
Jing Xin,

385
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,680
please arrange for General's stay.

386
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:04,759
Okay.

387
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:06,999
General Mo,

388
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:07,960
please come with me.

389
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:19,578
(Princess's Residence)

390
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,200
What happened?

391
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,440
The new prince consort,

392
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,600
with a thud,

393
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,119
pushed the door open,

394
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,200
picked Her Highness up

395
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,239
and headed towards the bed.

396
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,879
Who wouldn't love such a man?

397
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:40,519
No wonder

398
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,840
Princess likes him more
compared to the previous two.

399
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,200
Bold of you to gossip about the master of this house.

400
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,119
Are you seeking death?

401
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,360
Forgive us, Prince Consort. We have made a mistake.

402
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,680
Where is Princess?

403
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,720
Her Highness is

404
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,360
in the new prince consort's chamber.

405
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,239
Prince Consort.

406
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,239
What is it?

407
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,200
Princess said

408
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,800
no one is to disturb her

409
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,399
when she's in Main Prince Consort's chamber.

410
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:14,560
Young Master,

411
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,960
do you think

412
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,440
Princess may have run into
some unspeakable difficulties?

413
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,879
Check it out for me.

414
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,999
If you hear anything,

415
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:23,840
report to me anytime.

416
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:24,879
Understood.

417
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
You look so beautiful today.

418
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,279
Since when did Princess

419
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,440
learn to be shy?

420
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,279
You're not giving me an explanation on
why you stayed over at your ex-girlfriend's

421
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,879
and you still appear so righteous?

422
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,759
Which girl wouldn't be shy

423
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,800
when they're together with the person they like?

424
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,119
Is that all

425
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,200
you wanted to tell me?

426
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,320
I should be the one

427
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,039
asking Your Highness that.

428
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,960
Still so stubborn.

429
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,999
You've already been back for a while.

430
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,999
Why haven't you greeted Main Prince Consort?

431
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,440
Greetings

432
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,639
should be done in the morning.

433
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,600
Now that the morning has passed,

434
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,919
it would be disrespectful to do my greetings.

435
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,440
A load of rubbish, all excuses!

436
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,080
Why,

437
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
Your Highness, do you want me to show disrespect

438
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:19,600
to Main Prince Consort

439
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,680
on my first day?

440
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,080
Your Highness,

441
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,239
don't get angry.

442
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,279
In any case,

443
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,639
we'll have more opportunities in the future.

444
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,720
You're right, Prince Consort.

445
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,279
Next time, once it reaches the morning,

446
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,039
you will need to go and greet Yun Xiu.

447
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:40,879
Let's go.

448
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:51,999
Princess, Prince Consort.

449
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,159
Young Master, Young Master.

450
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,279
Previously,

451
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,919
General Feng Yang and Prince Consort

452
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,399
had a confrontation.

453
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:02,159
General thinks that he's suspicious.

454
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,519
In order to calm things down,

455
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,519
Princess arranged for her to stay
in the guest room of our residence.

456
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:08,800
Let's go take a look.

457
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,879
Feng Yang.

458
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,639
Eighth Brother.

459
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,320
Our situation now

460
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
is what you get for trying to oust Eldest Brother.

461
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,680
Since you're willing to stay at the residence,

462
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,519
I'm sure you have the same thoughts as me.

463
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,440
There has been foul play

464
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,080
in this peace-making marriage.

465
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,239
That's what I want to investigate,

466
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,440
as long as you don't cause trouble.

467
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,440
As a woman,

468
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,840
it'll be difficult for you to enter a man's boudoir.

469
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,039
But I

470
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,159
can help you.

471
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,800
Under what conditions?

472
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,440
Tell me

473
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,800
what kind of person Yun Xiu is.

474
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,159
How will men be able to understand

475
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,919
what happens on the battlefield?

476
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,840
Why don't you try?

477
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Although Yun Xiu is a man,

478
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:11,879
he was awarded the rank of a general
because he is of noble descent.

479
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,999
He has been guarding the border
between Dongyue and West Yue.

480
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,800
The situation suddenly got tense last year,

481
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,320
and he deliberately ordered
for the troops to draw back.

482
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,200
Tell me,

483
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,999
why do you think he did that?

484
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,279
The Empty City stratagem.

485
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
When the situation escalated,

486
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:25,840
the armies of both sides were in a deadlock,

487
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,279
he deliberately sent soldiers to negotiate.

488
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,239
Why was that?

489
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:31,320
A fake surrender.

490
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,039
Yun Xiu is full of tricks.

491
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,399
He even tried to launch sneak attacks at night.

492
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,759
Thankfully my army was well-prepared

493
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,119
and we were victorious.

494
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,119
Therefore,

495
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,840
this peace-making marriage

496
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,759
is definitely not simple.

497
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,720
I'll find an opportunity

498
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,840
to search his room

499
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,999
and find some leads.

500
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,399
Be careful.

501
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,519
Where is she?

502
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:18,960
Prince Consort.

503
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,320
Where's Second Princess?

504
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:21,360
She should be

505
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
in Main Prince Consort's chamber.

506
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,039
I will take my leave.

507
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,159
Spending the night in the imperial bedchamber...

508
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,039
I'll give you a taste of how I felt.

509
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,399
Upsetting you like this

510
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:46,960
isn't considered going overboard, right?

and I'll believe you a billion times.

521
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,399
But you won't even say a word.

522
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,639
And it seems like

523
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,800
you're intentionally out to upset me.

(Princess's Residence)

527
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,360
Secondary Prince Consort, why are you

528
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,119
barging into my room?

529
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,480
Attacking me without first
seeking an explanation,

530
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,480
is that how Xiyue taught you to behave?

531
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,720
Is sneaking around

532
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,560
a habit of Dongyue's men?

533
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:09,999
Why are you fighting so early in the morning?

534
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,080
Yun Xiu's skills

535
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
are pretty awesome though.

536
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,600
Princess,

537
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,999
ask him

538
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,919
what he was trying to do,

539
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,879
breaking into my room early in the morning.

540
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,519
I felt apologetic for offending
Prince Consort yesterday.

541
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:28,560
I came to clean Prince Consort's room
to make up for it.

542
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
But Prince Consort attacked me
without first figuring out the situation.

543
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,800
So I ended up fighting with Prince Consort.

544
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,560
I see.

545
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,159
So you wanted to give expiation.

546
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,600
I have a good idea.

547
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
Don't you have some nice things from your dowry

548
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,200
that you can give to Prince Consort

549
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,399
to prepare?

550
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,680
Let Yun Xiu teach you how to prepare lunch

551
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:51,440
and make

552
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,879
Xiyue nut cake

553
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,440
to make up

554
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,879
for your mistake.

555
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:58,919
Okay.

556
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,279
Speed things up.

557
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,360
Put those

558
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,960
walnuts, dates

559
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:19,960
raisins and Chinese wolfberries all in.

560
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:22,279
Move faster.

561
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,560
Princess.

562
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:30,720
Have a taste.

563
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,159
This aroma

564
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,239
is just soul-stirring.

565
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,039
This Xiyue nut cake

566
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,480
looks sweet, soft, glutinous,
smells and tastes delicious.

567
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,239
It is worthy to be

568
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,960
on "A Bite of Xiyue".
["A Bite of China" is a documentary on Chinese cuisine]

569
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,200
Can "soul-stirring" be used

570
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,320
to describe aroma?

571
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,320
Look at you.

572
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,440
Your actions are chaotic,
you're unfamiliar with the procedures,

573
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:01,800
and your service is terrible.

574
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
I think you are

575
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
on the verge of being repudiated.

576
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,560
Yun Xiu.

577
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,519
Feed me.

578
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,440
You...

579
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,560
What?

580
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm afraid Your Highness will choke to death.

581
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,480
Are you feeding a cow?

582
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,360
Princess.

583
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:28,720
Princess.

584
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,039
It's time for me to bring General Mo her lunch.

585
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,800
Great timing.

586
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,720
Yun Xiu,

587
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:37,600
bring her the nut cake

588
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,200
that you made yourself.

589
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:38,800
Okay.

590
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:40,080
Didn't I make it?

591
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,999
Princess and I taught you how.

592
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,360
You...

593
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,239
He seems

594
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,639
very satisfied with the way you're doing things.

595
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,239
Yun Xiu and I are of one mind,

596
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:58,519
of course he's satisfied.

597
00:31:58,879 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm saying

598
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
that compared to staying here,

599
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,320
he wants to go find Feng Yang more.

600
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,999
Stop trying to change the topic.

601
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,759
Jing Xin. Jing Xin.

602
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,519
What are you doing?

603
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,999
Comparing sizes.

604
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,800
I wouldn't want you and Prince Consort

605
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,919
to both choke to death.

606
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,239
Lord of Jealousy

607
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,360
turned green-eyed all of a sudden.

608
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:54,519
You...

609
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,800
I just made these. Have a taste.

610
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,239
Prince Consort, you are very skilled at cooking,

611
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,480
but I'm not hungry right now.

612
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,999
General, you needn't be so impatient.

613
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,759
I just didn't want to trouble you,

614
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,719
I had no other intentions.

615
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,640
Use the cloth.

616
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,360
This is to tell me that he didn't
put poison in them.

617
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,439
Innocent on the outside,

618
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,039
he must have ulterior motives.

619
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,600
He's coming, he's coming.

620
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,479
Here.

621
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,519
How is it? Does it taste good?

622
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,719
Don't move.

623
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,920
You got something on your face,

624
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,360
let me get it for you.

625
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,880
Your Highness, when do you start liking

626
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,479
hairy men?

627
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,439
I've completely forgotten about that.

628
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,640
Love can really

629
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,999
change a person quietly.

630
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,600
Stand by.

631
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,679
Serve us tea.

632
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,320
Here, Yun Xiu,

633
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,479
have some more.

634
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,439
Have an orange.

635
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
- I'll peel it for you. I'll peel it.
- I'll do it.

636
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,160
- Let me.
- Let me.

637
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,640
When did the rules change?

638
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,160
The concubine shouldn't eat

639
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,840
at the same table as us to begin with.

640
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:22,840
Before,

641
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,160
I spoiled you too much.

642
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,640
Issuing an order in the morning
and rescinding it in the evening,

643
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:27,800
it's unconvincing.

644
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,640
Fine.

645
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,880
What do you think, Main Prince Consort?

646
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,160
What do you think?

647
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,039
Excellent.

648
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,920
This way,

649
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,640
no one disagrees.

650
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,400
Yun Xiu.

651
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
What Yun Xiu feeds me

652
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,560
tastes so good.

653
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Are you not hungry?

654
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:23,679
If you're not,

655
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,920
practice your swordsmanship outside.

656
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,840
Okay.

657
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
I'll practice with you.

658
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,560
When you have an opponent,

659
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,880
you can test your true powers.

660
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,800
That depends on whether
you're worthy of being my opponent.

661
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,439
Why aren't you attacking?

662
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,840
I don't want to hurt you.

663
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,239
No need to worry.

664
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
You think too much.

665
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,120
Did you let him

666
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,679
train with Mo Feng Yang on purpose?

667
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,160
No.

668
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,320
Aren't you staying over at Yun Xiu's?

669
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,640
What are you doing in Snow Court?

670
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:38,719
No hurry.

671
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,920
Regardless of what happens,

672
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,239
Yun Xiu will wait for me.

673
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,519
Why do you keep

674
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,239
trying to upset me?

675
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,199
You're allowed to be unwilling to leave
the imperial bedchamber,

676
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,679
but I'm not allowed to do PDA?

677
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,679
I was trapped in the palace,
I couldn't decide my own actions.

678
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,080
Where did the "unwilling to leave" come from?

679
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,239
Not being able to decide your own actions

680
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,120
allows you to stay over at Her Majesty's
bedchamber for the entire night?

681
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,239
Why did Her Majesty gift you so many things

682
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,039
while you did nothing?

683
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,199
So this is the reason

684
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,759
you've been trying to upset me on purpose.

685
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,279
Then everything with Yun Xiu

686
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:08,800
has all been an act?

687
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,080
That's not why.

688
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,679
Yun Xiu and I have a bond as strong as gold.

689
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,320
It's not because of this?

690
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:18,479
Then it's because

691
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,679
I didn't give you half

692
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,279
of what Her Majesty gifted me.

693
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,080
Who cares about your shitty gifts?

694
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Jing Xin's idea is terrible.

695
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,320
Not telling her the truth isn't a bad idea.

696
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,320
This way, I won't wake a sleeping wolf.

697
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,640
I'll explain everything

698
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,519
once I find out all

699
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,039
about Yun Xiu's secrets.

700
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,400
Also,

701
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,519
she looks quite cute

702
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,560
