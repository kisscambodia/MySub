Long live the Empress.

17
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,880
Rise.

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,800
(She looks just like me.)

19
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
(No one finds it weird?)

20
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,880
(Well, they do say that)

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,000
(nieces tend to look like their aunts.)

22
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,240
(He must be surprised too.)

23
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
(That's Cheng Cheng.)

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,390
Oh, no.

25
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,470
(Why are you so excited seeing Cheng Cheng?)

26
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,360
(Cheng Cheng is mine.)

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,910
Now, the people live in peace

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,080
and the nation is united.

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,240
But I couldn't slack off.

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,550
So I select harem candidates
once every three years.

31
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,390
Is there anyone who can alleviate my concerns?

32
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,720
Your Majesty,

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,200
The Eighth Young Master of
the Mo family is versatile。

34
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,190
He's the most outstanding candidate.

35
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,910
Your Majesty,

36
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,720
I find Young Master Mo quite reserved.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,910
He is a boring person.

38
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm afraid he does not possess the talent
to entertain you, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,160
Young Master Mo has excellent sword skills.

40
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,080
Then why don't we have him
perform for us right now?

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,760
He'll be able to convince the other
candidates of his skills as well.

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,800
Your Majesty. Princess.

43
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,320
It is inappropriate to brandish
a sword in the great hall.

44
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,270
I'm afraid...

45
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,080
It doesn't matter.

46
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,510
Isn't this my perfume sachet?

48
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,160
Why is it with you?

49
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Your Majesty, Mo Lian Cheng is concealing
a woman's personal belonging.

50
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
His actions are improper.

51
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,480
He has been caught red-handed.

52
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,270
Please deal with him accordingly.

53
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,390
Mo Lian Cheng, what is going on with you?

54
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,550
Your Majesty, please review it carefully.

55
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,210
We should be asking when did the owner

56
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,230
of the perfume sachet remove it

57
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
and when did the attendant responsible
for her attire put it back in place.

58
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,920
Only I, who have had my body searched,
should not be asked such a question.

59
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,950
Your Majesty,

60
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,790
there should be no problems

61
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,390
with clothes prepared in the palace.

62
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,720
I would not have come into contact

63
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,040
Her Highness' perfume sachet either.

64
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,110
You spilled tea on me on purpose.

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,200
You must have done it because you admire me

66
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,350
and took the sachet when I was changing my clothes.

67
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,670
Your Highness knows very well

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,480
how the tea was split and who

69
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,110
requested a change of clothes.

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Your Majesty,

71
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
there are a lot of doubts regarding today's matter.

72
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,320
If word got out, it might do the harem harm.

73
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,670
Even if Young Master Mo was wronged,

74
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,070
everything that has happened today

75
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,110
proves that he is unfit to participate
in the harem selection.

76
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,270
Your Majesty, please remove him from the list.

77
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,920
Things haven't come out in the wash.

78
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,040
Why does Your Highness refuse to
allow me to defend myself?

79
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,390
Ultimately,

80
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,390
that perfume sachet fell out of your sleeves.

81
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Everyone here saw that.

82
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,110
Or do you wish

83
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,390
that Her Majesty be criticized by people?

84
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,040
You...

85
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,160
Official Su.

86
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,480
Investigate this matter.

87
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,110
Your Majesty is wise.

89
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,780
(Mo Residence)

90
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,270
For generations, the Mo family
has always been revered.

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,230
Yet today, you have tarnished our reputation.

92
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,510
Not only have we become the laughing
stock of the residence,

93
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,160
even the government officials
in the neighborhood

94
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,670
have a lot to say about you!

95
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,600
What do you think we should do?

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,640
Father, Eighth Brother has always been
a man with good character.

97
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,720
It must be a misunderstanding

98
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,000
regarding today's matter.

99
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Her Majesty has ordered someone
to investigate it, hasn't she?

100
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm sure the truth will come out soon.

101
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,230
Eldest Brother is right.

102
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,640
Once the truth is out,

103
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,390
we'll see if those slanderers

104
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,270
will be ashamed or not.

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,790
What do you know, Fourteenth?

106
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,160
Shut up!

107
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,110
I was asking him. Not you!

108
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,950
People only wish to believe
what they want to believe.

109
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,070
And they enjoy it.

110
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,510
The only thing we can do

111
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,270
is break the rumors by revealing the truth.

112
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,640
The Mo family has already been
criticized by people.

113
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,950
Does the truth still matter?

114
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,720
You don't get to decide if you were right or wrong.

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
Her Majesty decides that.

116
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,830
Before Her Majesty decides what to do with you,

117
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,200
you will copy the moral codes for men every day.

118
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,070
You will do that right now!

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,440
Yes, Father.

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,590
Eighth Brother.

121
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,440
You are saying that he stole your perfume sachet?

122
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,400
Could it be because you and Her Majesty

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,080
look alike, he has fallen

124
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,590
for you instead?

125
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
But that's not right.

126
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,000
If he didn't do something so foolish,

127
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,030
he'd have successfully joined the harem.

128
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,520
Why would he even need to shift
his attention to another person?

129
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
(The entire world knows)

130
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,760
(that I look like Her Majesty.)

131
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,280
(I guess I'll have to pretend)

132
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,590
(that I'm used to it as well.)

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,710
Your Highness?

134
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,320
He was framed.

135
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,640
I just

136
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,000
gave them an extra push.

137
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,030
Why?

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,280
Maybe you guys are thinking
in the wrong direction?

139
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
Have you guys never thought

140
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,440
that the reason this kind of thing has happened

141
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,280
was that Her Majesty looks like me?

142
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,710
You mustn't say that, Your Highness!

143
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,400
That is highly disrespectful.

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,880
Aren't you a brave and invincible guard?

145
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Why are you such a coward?

146
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,880
Stopping Your Highness from getting
into trouble due to your loose tongue

147
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,150
is also part of my duties as
protecting Your Highness.

148
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,150
However... Regardless of what happened
between Her Majesty and him,

149
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
I only had to use a little trick

150
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,150
to make him pliant.

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,470
Let's see if he dares to look down on me again.

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,320
Your Highness's plan was flawless.

153
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,320
However, with your interference,

154
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,670
I'm afraid Eighth Young Master will no longer
be able to have a good marriage.

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,710
The entire Mo family will be affected as well.

156
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,080
Are things really as serious as you say?

157
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,230
Think about it.

158
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,110
Men's futures

159
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,200
have everything to do with their reputation.

160
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,910
If a man's reputation is tarnished,

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,640
that'll be the end of their futures as well.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,520
The reputation of the Mo family will also...

163
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you saying that he might
be kicked out of his house?

164
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,440
I'm afraid not only that.

165
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,960
Her Majesty is involved.

166
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,710
If he is found guilty,

167
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,280
a lighter sentence would mean that
he'll be sent to become a monk.

168
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,880
A heavier sentence might mean
he'll be dipped in a pig cage.

169
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Dipped in a pig cage?

170
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,520
Oh, no. Things got out of hand this time.

171
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,030
His brothers

172
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,550
may be affected as well.

173
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,400
Jing Xin.

174
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,230
Come with me to the Mo Residence. Hurry!

175
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
Are we almost there yet?

176
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,320
The Mo Residence is up ahead, Your Highness.

177
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,200
A cherry blossom tree?

178
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,320
Quick, stop the carriage.

179
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,230
But we're not there yet.

180
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,280
Stop the carriage!

181
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,030
Stop the carriage!

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,960
Your Highness!

183
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,110
Your Highness,

184
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,200
I'll go and notify them first.

185
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,520
Please wait here.

186
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,790
It really is the tree... It must be fate.

187
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,640
No matter how many times I come here,

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,960
the person I love is waiting for me
on the other side of the wall.

189
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
How come I awfully succeeded this time?

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,110
Oh, it's because Jing Xin isn't here.

191
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,550
Where is Jing Xin?

192
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,150
Jing Xin? Jing Xin!

193
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,670
Never mind. Forget about her.

194
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll just climb in by myself.

195
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,280
This body... This process...

196
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,640
This body is too used to this.

197
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,590
Cheng Cheng! Cheng Cheng!

198
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,440
Cheng Cheng, it's me!

199
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,440
Come and catch me!

200
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,110
He is doing better this time.

201
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,320
I've lost all my limberness

202
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,000
from taking care of the kids for all these years.

203
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm going down now, Cheng Cheng.

204
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,640
You have to catch me.

205
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,440
Here I come.

206
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,880
Catch me!

207
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,780
♪The most beautiful moment
is when I fell for you♪

208
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,340
♪Infatuation leads me to jump into a vortex♪

Mo Lian Cheng!

213
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,840
You let me fall right in front of you again.

214
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,320
You do that every single time!

215
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,110
It hurts a lot.

216
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,350
Men and women...

217
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,710
Should have no direct contact.

218
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,140

219

Tan Er.

220
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
(Who is that?)

221
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,960
(He even calls me Tan Er.)

222
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,550
(I've never seen him before.)

223
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,400
(He is quite handsome though.)

224
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,790
Yan Chen came late.

225
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,150
You're not hurt, are you?

226
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,150
Here, let me see if you were injured.

227
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm fine.

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,880
Don't worry.

229
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,790
Eighth Brother knows about
our feelings for each other.

230
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,230
(Feelings?)

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,520
(Shouldn't Qu Tan Er and Mo Yi Huai)

232
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,230
(be the ones who have feelings for each other?)

233
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,350
(This guy said his name is Yan Chen.)

234
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,000
(Mo Yan Chen... Then what about Mo Yi Huai?)

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
(This is confusing.)

236
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,350
Tan Er?

237
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,030
You're mistaken.

238
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I came because of...

239
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,110
Of course I know that

240
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,550
the matter with Eighth Brother
was all a misunderstanding.

241
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,230
And you came to resolve it.

242
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,760
Come with me to see my father in the main hall.

243
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
Where is Her Highness?

244
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,200
Please.

245
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,910
Please wait for a moment.

246
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,910
Your Highness.

247
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,790
Jing Xin.

248
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,080
Where were you earlier?

249
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,110
We'll talk later.

250
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,470
Father.

251
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,320
Your Highness has come to our humble abode.

253
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,280
Yet I did not greet you at the entrance.

254
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,790
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

255
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,230
Father...

256
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,150
(I almost forgot.)

257
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,030
(He is no longer the emperor.)

258
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,350
(There are so many things I have to get used to.)

259
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,550
Mr. Mo.

260
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,080
Senior.

261
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,030
Mr. Mo.

262
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
I came here today

263
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,520
specifically for Eighth Young Master's candidacy.

264
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,280
It was all a misunderstanding.

265
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,110
It wasn't my intention to cause

266
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,790
so much trouble for the Mo family.

267
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,310
Your Highness' misunderstanding

268
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,070
did make our family

269
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,710
get into trouble.

270
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,400
I especially came here today to tell you

271
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,280
that I am willing to take responsibility.

272
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,190
To take responsibility for Eighth Young Master.

273
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,310
Does Your Highness mean...

274
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,590
Could it be...

275
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,430
There is no need for that.

276
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,070
Putting aside the fact that you and
my brother are childhood playmates,

277
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,760
my reputation has yet to be rebuilt.

278
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,190
Even if you would take responsibility,

279
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,190
doing so

280
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,160
would only tarnish your reputation as well.

281
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,680
It would do no good for the Mo family.

282
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,920
Don't worry.

283
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,430
I will help rebuild Eighth Young Master's

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,160
and the Mo family's reputation.

285
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,400
I shall wait for good news from
you then, Your Highness.

286
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,500
(Mo Residence)

287
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,160
I haven't figured out what happened
to Cheng Cheng yet.

288
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,590
I can't go back to Dongyue.

289
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,190
And I can't see my Yu Er.

290
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,070
And there's this mess right now.

291
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,710
How am I supposed to rebuild
Cheng Cheng's reputation?

292
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,680
Jing Xin.

293
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,000
Let me ask you.

294
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,350
Is there a way to spread one's good deeds

295
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,830
around fast

296
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,950
in Dongyue?

297
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,560
You could find a storyteller.

298
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,230
That's right.

299
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,430
I'll have him write a story on Mo Lian Cheng.

300
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
And

301
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,350
we'll get the most famous and popular storyteller

302
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,680
to tell the story to the people all day long.

303
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
Get it done right now.

304
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,750
The story must be delivered tomorrow.

305
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,280
Yes, Your Highness. I'll get to it right away.

306
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,680
Wait.

307
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,160
That doesn't seem enough.

308
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,310
Find a mason.

309
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,710
One that's good at carving scripts.

310
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,160
And find a few kids

311
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,520
that are smart and good with words.

312
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,430
We'll turn it into a nursery rhyme

313
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,230
and have the children sing it all across the city!

314
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,000
That should do it.

315
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,310
Go on now.

316
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,160
Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,520
Her Majesty wants to know the results

318
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
of the investigation regarding
the harem candidate incident.

319
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,160
That is why she has asked both of you to come here today.

320
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,430
So you can give Her Highness an explanation as well.

321
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,640
But why has Official Su

322
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,430
yet to report to Her Majesty?

323
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,760
I have failed my duties.

324
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,230
Please ask Her Majesty to allow
a few extra days of grace.

325
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,920
I will do my best to ensure that

326
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,920
I find the evidence that proves that
Young Master Mo was framed.

327
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,880
Her Majesty asked you to find the truth.

328
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,640
I know the truth.

329
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,470
Did Your Highness

330
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,560
find evidence that proves

331
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,310
Eighth Young Master stole your perfume sachet?

332
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,880
The truth is...

333
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,640
Mo Lian Cheng...

334
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,520
was framed.

335
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,040
But on the day of the harem selection,

336
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,280
Your Highness was the one who insisted
that it was Mo Lian Cheng who stole it.

337
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,190
I saw

338
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,470
my perfume sachet slip out from his sleeves.

339
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,350
I was blinded by a moment of rage.

340
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,710
When I thought about it again,

341
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,040
I realized that everyone in Dongyue

342
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,640
knows about Young Master Mo's
upstanding character.

343
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,280
But without the evidence,

344
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,640
how could you...

345
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,520
Her Majesty gave me that perfume sachet.

346
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,000
Once you touch the powder inside, you won't
be able to rid of the scent for seven days.

347
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,310
Butterflies especially favor the scent.

348
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,800
The harem candidates

349
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
had the largest suspicion that day.

350
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,430
If you wish to find out

351
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,950
if Young Master Mo was framed by someone,

352
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,800
or by whom,

353
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,190
you only need to...

354
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640
gather

355
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
the harem candidates

356
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,310
and release the butterflies.

357
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,190
Apart from

358
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,400
Mo Lian Cheng and I, the butterflies

359
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,680
would land on...

360
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,280
of course the most suspicious

361
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,040
harem candidates.

362
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,350
In order to find out the truth,

363
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,110
this is an experiment worth testing.

364
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,000
There is no need for that!

365
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,470
This... This isn't necessary.

366
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,400
Everyone knows that Young Master Mo
has a good and fair character.

367
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,830
Even Her Highness is willing to
let the matter go as well.

368
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,830
Isn't that a wonderful ending?

369
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,520
The Mo family are descendants
of the nation's founding members.

370
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm sure Her Majesty will be pleased to know
that Eighth Young Master's reputation

371
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,880
has been rebuilt.

372
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,590
I will report this matter to Her Majesty.

373
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,800
I was incompetent.

374
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,470
Her Highness was observant.

375
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,830
I am ashamed.

376
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,560
I've always known

377
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,680
that Official Su is loyal to Her Majesty.

378
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
However, if someone around Her Majesty

379
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,710
grows jealous and intends to frame another...

380
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,640
That is a matter that must not be taken lightly.

381
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,760
Yes, yes.

382
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,920
Your Highness is right.

383
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,920
I shall take my leave then.

384
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,520
Your Majesty, as per your orders,

385
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,040
I have summoned both of them to the palace.

386
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,680
I have verified the matter.

387
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,710
Su Yue La's brother, Su Jing Yuan,
has been suspected of framing Mo Lian Cheng.

388
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,230
Leave Su Yue La.

389
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,880
I still have use for her.

390
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,760
As for her brother...

391
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,800
Punish him according to the laws.

392
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,680
Do you also think that Qu Tan Er
spoke up for Mo Lian Cheng

393
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,000
during the harem selection

394
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,640
to earn my favor?

395
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,190
I suppose it may have just
been a misunderstanding

396
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,190
when she accused Mo Lian Cheng.

397
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,110
After all, she has always been

398
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,040
respectful to Your Majesty.

399
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,430
Cheng...

400
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,040
Oh, you're all here.

401
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,680
Perfect.

402
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,560
Your Highness.

403
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,710
How do you think?

404
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,400
Not only did I

405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,950
clear your name in the palace,

406
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,070
but I also

407
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,920
rebuilt your reputation in the streets as well.

408
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,310
Are you surprised?

409
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,760
Think about how you're going to thank me.

410
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,950
Your Highness is indeed considerate.

411
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,680
I'm sure

412
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,160
that everyone in Dongyue

413
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,190
knows of my good name now.

414
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,230
What do you mean?

415
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
What's with that tone?

416
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,400
Tan Er.

417
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,880
The storyteller in the tea houses.

418
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,520
The nursery rhymes sung by the children
all across the city.

419
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,680
And the plaque. You did all those things?

420
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,040
Yes! I was trying to rebuild his...

421
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,880
I was trying to make sure his good deeds
are well-known and praised.

422
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,710
I know you had good intentions,

423
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,230
but Eighth Brother's mood

424
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,280
hasn't been the best since he saw theses

425
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,190
on the streets today.

426
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,760
Since Your Highness has helped me

427
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,230
rebuilt my reputation,

428
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,560
I'm sure Her Majesty will take pity on me as well.

429
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,400
I shall not trouble Your Highness any further.

430
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
What do you mean?

431
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,000
Are you still trying to join the harem?

432
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,880
I shall not disturb both of you any further.

433
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,950
I'll take my leave.

434
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,640
You...

435
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,040
Tan Er, Eighth Brother may appear cold and stoic,

436
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,520
but he is warm-hearted.

437
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,160
Please do not stay angry at him.

438
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,590
You must be thirsty.

439
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,520
Have a cup of tea.

440
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,710
Oh, right.

441
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,950
I just remembered that I've got some
government affairs to do.

442
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,400
Why don't we arrange for another
meeting on another day?

443
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,000
All right. I won't keep you any longer

444
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,470
if you are busy.

445
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,640
Okay.

446
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,590
I'll walk you out.

447
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,230
Don't bother. I can show myself out.

448
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,710
Trying to ditch me? No way.

449
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,830
Hold it right there, Fourteenth.

450
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,880
What did you give Jing Xin just now?

451
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,430
Greetings, Your Highness.

452
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,950
Do you still rank fourteenth?

453
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,950
Still? I've always been the fourteenth son.

454
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,800
That's odd.

455
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,830
Men in Dongyue can only marry one woman.

456
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,520
It takes time for a woman to carry a child...

457
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,830
Does that mean

458
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,000
that you are much younger than Mo Lian Cheng

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,230
and Mo Yan Chen?

460
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,710
Quite a few of my brothers are twins.

461
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,070
Didn't you know, Your Highness?

462
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,710
Twins?

463
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,560
I learn something new again.

464
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,830
Seem like they've tried very hard

465
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,760
to have a daughter.

466
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
I've always wanted to ask this.

467
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,590
Where are your other 13 brothers?

468
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,520
Why have I never met them?

469
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,040
I don't have 13 brothers.

470
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,400
I have a sister.

471
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,830
A sister?

472
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,710
That's another person I don't know.

473
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,710
Then do you have a brother named Mo Yi Huai?

474
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,760
No.

475
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,190
Oh, I remember now.

476
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,040
Father once said that I had another brother

477
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,230
before Eldest Brother was born.

478
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,950
But they gave him to another family
the moment he was born.

479
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,040
I think that was the name they gave him then.

480
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,800
How did you know about this, Your Highness?

481
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,190
(So that's why...)

482
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,470
(Qu Tan Er and Mo Yan Chen were childhood playmates.)

483
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,800
I... I have to go back now.

484
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,310
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

485
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,800
Jing Xin.

486
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,920
When did the two of you get so close?

487
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,190
Who? What do you mean, "close"?

488
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,230
Still hiding it.

489
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
You and Fourteenth, of course.

490
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,560
Well, that's because

491
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,230
I've been coming here with you
as your guard since young.

492
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,760
Naturally, we'd know each other.

493
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,110
Mr. Mo is quite strict with him.

494
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,800
Please do not misunderstand him, Your Highness.

495
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,430
There's nothing to feel embarrassed about.

496
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,040
He will be yours sooner or later.

497
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,760
(Didn't Her Highness always told me
to mind my distance with him)

498
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,190
(so that I won't tarnish his reputation?)

499
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,310
(Why is she saying something like this now?)

500
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,590
What are you thinking?

501
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,560
Let's go home.

502
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

503
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,230
Sit.

504
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,880
Give me a shoulder massage.

505
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,110
With Jing Xin guarding the palace gate
day and night,

506
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,800
Mo Lian Cheng

507
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,470
won't even have a chance to seduce others.

508
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,160
If he dares to come, then I'll dare to ruin his plans.

509
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,760
Want to be alone with her? Not a chance.

510
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,830
Your Highness.

511
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,110
What is it? Is something up?

512
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,070
Your Highness,

513
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,590
Eighth Young Master was reported
to have entered the palace.

514
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,950
What?

515
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,350
You can't go, Your Highness.

516
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,350
What if Her Majesty and Eighth Young Master
are discussing something important?

517
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,280
All right.

518
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,830
You've been guarding the gate
all day. You must be tired.

519
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,950
Go and get some rest.

520
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,950
I'll see

521
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,310
what they have to discuss
in the middle of the night!

522
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,350
All right. You've worked hard.

523
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,110
Her Highness

524
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,310
is like an entirely different person recently.

525
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,920
Always at odds with Eighth Young Master.

526
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,040
Why do I feel as if

527
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,760
you've gotten a lot smarter?

528
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,310
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

529
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
Stop! Let go!

530
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,920
How dare you be so rude to Her Majesty!

531
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,590
It's all right. He just spilled some tea.

532
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,590
Why are you here?

533
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,280
It was just a misunderstanding.

534
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,310
Cheng Cheng, why are you here?

535
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,280
It was just a misunderstanding.

536
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,470
What's wrong with him?

537
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,710
Should we ask for an imperial physician?

538
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,230
No need. I was just taken aback for a moment.

539
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,430
I apologize for scaring Your Majesty.

540
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,350
Why did you come here at this hour, Tan Er?

541
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,800
I've been having trouble sleeping recently.

542
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,800
I wanted to borrow some books from
the royal library to help me sleep,

543
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,920
but

544
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,230
I saw a suspicious figure along
the palace walkways.

545
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,310
I was worried about Your Majesty's safety

546
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,880
and got anxious, so I ran here immediately.

547
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,710
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

548
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,470
Tan Er is very considerate.

549
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,640
Your Majesty, that suspicious figure was me.

550
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,710
I am much-maligned now.

551
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,190
And I entered the palace in the middle of the night.

552
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,470
I was worried that would affect
Your Majesty's reputation,

553
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,190
so I took the route around
the royal library instead.

554
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,000
I didn't expect that I would've
alerted Her Highness.

555
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,920
Well, if there is nothing else,

556
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,310
then please allow me to take my leave.

557
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,070
You can leave as well.

558
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,760
I'll take my leave, Your Majesty.

559
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,350
Sorry. Sorry.

560
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,920
I was wrong, okay?

561
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,350
Then, please tell me, Your Highness.

562
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,110
What did you do wrong?

563
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,560
I... I shouldn't have interrupted you

564
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,520
and Her Majesty's affairs...

565
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,470
What are you laughing about?

566
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,000
Since when did Tan Er become so generous?

567
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,680
That you'd let someone else have your husband?

568
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,830
Cheng Cheng!

569
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,400
Is it really you, Cheng Cheng?

570
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,190
Then why did you pretend

571
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,430
as if you don't know me?

572
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
I fell from the wall.

573
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,350
And you wouldn't even catch me.

574
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,160
No. Wait.

575
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,040
You acted as if you don't know me

576
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,230
even when there was no one else around too.

577
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,590
Were you pulling a prank on me?

578
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,350
Do you know how worried I was? I...

00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,520
What? Did I bump into your teeth?

584
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,040
Please mind your propriety, Your Highness.

585
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,320
Mo Lian Cheng, who am I?

586
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,870
You are the Second Princess of Dongyue.

587
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,600
You are childhood playmates with
my eldest brother, Mo Yan Chen.

588
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,760
Please don't be so fickle-minded, Your Highness.

589
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,320
What's wrong with you? Do you not know me again?

590
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,910
I haven't even gotten my answers yet.

591
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,360
What exactly is going on?

592
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,670
Mate. You kissed me first.

593
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,280
Think about it again.

594
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,120
(It's true that I can't remember)

595
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,390
(how I left the room.)

596
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,390
(And how did she and I...)

597
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,470
(I only remember that I was searching
for the imperial token.)

598
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,120
(But why am I only missing this part of my memory?)

599
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,760
(This is the first time\)

600
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,150
(this has happened since I woke up months ago.)

601
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,390
(Could this have something
to do with my memory loss?)

602
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,840
Do you remember now?

603
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,190
Please do not spout nonsense, Your Highness.

604
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,840
All right, all right. I was the one talking nonsense.

605
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,670
I was the one who pulled you to me

606
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,230
and forced you with my tiny physique.

607
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,080
So what? What do you want to do about it?

608
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,120
Whatever the reason Your Highness
may have had for visiting today,

609
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,430
I ask you to stop doing it from now on.

610
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,670
Or else, I will have to think that
Your Highness has other intentions.

611
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,560
If there is nothing else, I shall take my leave now.

612
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,470
Could it be that he was like Tan Er and me?

613
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,320
Sharing the same body?

614
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,470
That'll make things complicated.
