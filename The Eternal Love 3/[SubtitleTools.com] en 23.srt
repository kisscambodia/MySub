Get married?

17
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,839
Really?

18
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,680
Yes.

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,960
We just discussed it today.

20
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Such good news.

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,759
I didn't expect my baby girl

22
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,199
to figure it out so quickly.

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,759
Mr. Jiang,
I have another good news for you.

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
You will be a grandfather.

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Fanlv, is that true?

26
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,279
Great!

27
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,759
By the way, Xiangyuan,

28
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,240
you should get your mother here

29
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,960
as soon as possible.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,639
Fanlv is pregnant.

31
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Our two families should discuss

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,919
the wedding and arrange it soon.

33
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,240
OK. I'll inform them right away.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,320
I have determined the hotel,

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,559
the best hotel in Shanghai,
Bin Jiang Hotel.

36
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,520
In addition to friends,

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,080
I will invite business partners.

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes, invite all of them.

39
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,600
It is a great occasion for the Jiangs
to marry their girl.

40
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,199
We have to organize a large wedding.

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,800
Mr. Jiang,
I'm thinking the same thing as you.

42
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,039
Don't worry.

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
I will hold a grand wedding for Fanlv.

44
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,600
So, your father is not in good health.

45
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,880
I understand your feelings now.

46
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,919
If your father is not present,

47
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
who is in charge of Yutian?

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
The rival.

49
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,080
The one who set you up here, right?

50
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,119
Maybe.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,199
It seems that you want to
give up a rook to save the king.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Just like pieces in your hand,

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,399
when you hold them in your hand,

54
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,759
they seem useless,

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
but when you put them on the chessboard,

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,360
they will play their roles.

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
No matter you
give up a rook to save the king

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
or the opposite,

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
there will be sacrifices.

60
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,039
Playing chess is the same as
being a human being,

61
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,479
there are losses and wins.

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,479
The cumulative number of losses

63
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,639
may lead to the final win.

64
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Miss Jiang, these wedding rings
are selected by Mr. Lin.

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,359
Please have a look.

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
You can select a ring you like.

67
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,040
Miss Jiang, please take a look.

68
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
These three wedding dresses are
the most popular ones we have this year.

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,079
Is there any one you like?

70
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,720
Do you need a reservation?

71
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,399
Mom,

72
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,519
I have good news for you.

73
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to get married.

74
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,160
Of course, it's true.

75
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,959
Get ready to

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,359
come to Shanghai in the next few days.

77
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,239
Mr. Wei,

78
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,559
hello, this is Lin.

79
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,119
What? You already knew that?

80
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,440
This is Xiangyuan,

81
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,839
and I'm going to get married.

82
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,279
I will share his work

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,200
in the future,

84
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,239
and our business will be smoother.

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,119
Miss Jiang,

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,720
this is our most popular bouquet
of the year.

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,720
Are you satisfied with that?

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,519
Mr. Lin thought...

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Fine, get out.

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
I want to stay alone for a while.

91
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:53,420
(Lin Xiangyuan)

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,239
Lin Xiangyuan, go to my father's office.

93
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,720
I want to talk to you.

94
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,799
Cancel the wedding?

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,000
It seems that
Mr. Jiang is disrespectful to you.

96
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,399
Even if she is disrespectful to you,

97
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,880
she must not be disrespectful to
your mother.

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
She is your mother!

99
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,760
Take it slow.

100
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,279
Be careful.

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Mr. Lin,
you can have a nap in the car first.

102
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,079
I will wake you up
when we arrive at your home.

103
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,920
Mr. Jiang,
there may be a problem with the car.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,200
The car can't be started.

105
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,440
What should I do?

106
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,160
I have to meet Mr. Xu now.

107
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,799
How about taking Mr. Lin's car?

108
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,640
I just saw he went out with Miss Jiang.

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,839
Zhang, is your mobile phone ringing?

110
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,160
No.

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,320
Mr. Lin,

112
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,839
Is it convenient to talk?

113
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,839
Mr. Yu let me tell you that

114
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,799
he earned a lot this time,

115
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,359
and he wants to thank you.

I'm not complimenting you,

118
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,959
you achieved
unintentional positive outcomes.

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,399
Mr. Yu did this
without leaving any trace.

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,959
Although Lei Yuzheng
has a responsibility,

122
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,320
he was indeed wronged.

123
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,239

Congratulations to you.

127
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,920
Mr. Jiang, are you OK?

128
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,279
Do you feel uncomfortable?

129

got our marriage license.

You are back.

136

Where is my dad?

137

come back for dinner?

Mr. Lin, please have a seat.

Today is your wedding day with Fanlv,

142
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,640
I don't dare to bother you.

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,280
Fanlv,
don't blame me for talking too much.

144
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,159
The wedding is too simple!

145
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,320
There is only one table
and several guests.

146
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,440
You should have a grander wedding.

147
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,599
My wedding is up to me.

148
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,919
Anyway, you're a family.

151

Mr. Jiang.

152
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,159
Fanlv,

153
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,840
go out to buy a bottle of wine for me.

154
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,400
There is wine in the house.

155
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,159
Just go.

156
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,719
Don't nag.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,919
Come with me.

158
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,080
Mr. Jiang,

159
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,760
are you looking for me?

160
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,239
Mr. Jiang?

161
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Don't flatter me.

162
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,919
Mr. Jiang, what do you mean?

163
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,039
Lin Xiangyuan,

164
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,799
don't play the fool with me.

165
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,320
You're really good at business.

166
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,080
You killed three hawks with one arrow.

167
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,599
You ruined Lei Yuzheng,

168
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,000
built yourself up,

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,679
and made me a fool.

170
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,400
I married my daughter to you.

171
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,200
Mr. Jiang, calm down.

172
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,960
There must be a misunderstanding.

173
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,159
Misunderstanding?

174
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,239
Tell me, who is Mr. Yu
that Xie Li was talking about?

175
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,200
Mr. Jiang.

176
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,679
You disappointed me too much.

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,239
I didn't expect that
the person I promoted

178
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,919
would do such a thing.

179
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,000
Mr. Jiang,

180
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,400
Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment really
has nothing to do with me.

181
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,039
I would never

182
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,400
dare to do that.

183
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm wholehearted to you and Fanlv.

184
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,000
I thought Lei Yuzheng looked down on you

185
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,479
because he is the major shareholder

186
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,679
of the Yutian Group.

187
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
I was very angry.

188
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,159
I just didn't like him,

189
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,919
but I never set him up on purpose

190
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,760
to such a serious extent.

191
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,440
Mr. Jiang, I swear

192
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,119
I didn't do it.

193
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,559
Shut up!

194
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,400
Lin Xiangyuan, are still you treating me
as a fool?

195
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,239
I‘ve been in the business field
for decades.

196
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,440
I know each is trying to
cheat the other.

197
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,280
But I have a bottom line.

198
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Mr. Jiang.

199
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,119
Tell me,

200
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,719
how would I dare
to keep someone like you

201
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,760
with no moral bottom line around me?

202
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,159
How would I dare to let Fanlv
live with you for the rest of her life.

203
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,039
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

204
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
I know that you don't trust me,

205
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,159
but I'm wholehearted to

206
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,359
you and Fanlv.

207
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,479
Shut up!

208
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,359
Mr. Jiang,

209
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,000
I have no complaints
no matter how you punish me,

210
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,719
but Fanlv and I have been married,

211
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,719
and she is carrying my baby now.

212
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,440
If you put me in jail,

213
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,559
you grandson will be born

214
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,400
without a father.

215
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,239
Mr. Jiang,
I will make up for my mistakes.

216
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,559
After Lei Yuzheng gets out of jail,

217
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
I will return Yutian to him.

218
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,400
Ok?

219
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,159
What's the use of making up for

220
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,239
what's happened?

221
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,359
You know that

222
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,400
Fanlv and I
just registered our marriage.

223
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,799
At his time, do you want her…

224
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,159
I swear that

225
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,039
I will treat and love Fanlv well.

226
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,679
After Lei Yuzheng gets out of jail,

227
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:22,359
I will definitely return Yutian to him.

228
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,039
Fanlv, you're married today,

229
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,640
and I'm very happy for you.

230
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,159
You're my baby girl,

231
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,200
and I always hope that

232
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,520
you can marry a good man who loves you.

233
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,280
But I also would like to warn you,

234
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,880
there is a gap
between the ideal and reality.

235
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
You need to learn to protect yourself.

236
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:14,359
Keep an eye on everything.

237
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,479
Remember?

238
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,440
Don't worry, Dad.

239
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,719
I won't leave you anyway.

240
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,400
Tell me, if I have any grievance.

241
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,679
Dad will always support you.

242
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:32,280
Mr. Jiang, a toast to you.

243
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,599
Since what is done cannot be undone,
I have nothing to say.

244
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,440
Xiangyuan, you should call me dad now.

245
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,640
Thank you, dad.

246
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,520
I have a word for you,

247
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,799
"The moon waxes only to wane,
water brims only to overflow."

248
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,039
Cherish what you've got now.

249
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,280
Leave some leeway for everything,

250
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,559
or you will lose more than
you gain sooner or later.

251
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,359
Dad, I remember that.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,919
Dad,

253
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,599
why are you so weird today?

254
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,239
Nothing.

255
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,479
I just want to give advices

256
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,760
about business to Xiangyuan.

257
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,119
Come on.

258
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,919
I wish you all the happiness.

259
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,919
May we have family harmony.

260
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,039
Here.

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,719
Lei Yuzheng.

262
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,359
Yes.

263
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,520
A woman called Shao Kaixuan
is coming to see you,

264
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,840
and she is waiting in the audience room.

265
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,160
Hello, Auntie Shao.

266
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,959
Yuzheng, how are you doing here?

267
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,079
I'm fine. Don't worry.

268
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,959
Yuzheng, take care of yourself.

269
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,920
Zhenrong is gone,

270
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,880
and you're all that I have.

271
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,839
Remember,

272
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,199
where there is life, there is hope.

273
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,040
Be sure to take care of yourself.

274
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,400
Understand?

275
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
Auntie Shao, don't worry.

276
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,880
I've long since adapted to this place.

277
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,000
How is my father doing?

278
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,800
I forgot to tell you that

279
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,239
your father is doing well.

280
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,920
He is on vacation abroad.

281
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,479
Look,

282
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,160
your farther is old,

283
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,800
and he is worried about you

284
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,359
because he cannot see you.

285
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,040
But Assistant He told him that

286
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,239
you were busy
doing your own thing abroad.

287
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,359
And your father asked no more questions.

288
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,040
Auntie Shao,
you don't have to say any more.

289
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,040
I trust you.

290
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
When I see my father in this situation,

291
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,800
I feel bad.

292
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,719
He is so old,

293
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,640
but I still have him worried.

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm not filial.

295
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,119
Yuzheng, I know that

296
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,400
what you've done is

297
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,520
to make Yutian

298
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,359
and the project survive.

299
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,040
Auntie Shao, don't worry.

300
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm good.

301
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,560
You and my father

302
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:42,760
should take care of yourselves.

303
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,040
When I get out,
I will show filial piety to you.

304
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm leaving.

305
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,439
Yes.

306
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,959
I understand.

307
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,920
Ok, Ok.

308
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,280
Mr. Jin, you can rest assured that

309
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,959
I will definitely show the simple,

310
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,640
modern, fashionable, high-end,
and magnificent style you like

311
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,000
at the lowest cost.

312
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,400
Do you think this is OK?

313
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,319
OK. Goodbye.

314
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,479
Du Xiaosu,

315
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,160
you're such a moneygrubber.

316
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
Only half a month left
before the New Year,

317
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
and you receive so many orders.
Can you finish them in time?

318
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:34,959
Life is about making money.

319
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,680
isn't that your motto?

320
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,520
No.

321
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,000
My motto is,
even if you don't earn money...

322
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,079
Who is that?

323
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,319
My mom.

324
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,199
Hello, mom.

325
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,119
Hello, my daughter. When do you go on
spring break and come back to home?

326
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,719
It's not easy to buy a ticket
if it's too late.

327
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
You need to book your flight
for the spring festival earlier.

328
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,280
Don't be muddleheaded,

329
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,640
or you will be in a rush and muddle.

330
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,959
Xiaosu,

331
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,920
your mom started making

332
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,719
your favorite smoked fish yesterday.

333
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,920
We wait for you to eat that
when you return in the Spring Festival.

334
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,359
Dad, Mom,

335
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,199
I was just about to
speak to you about this.

336
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,839
I may not go back home this year.

337
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,760
The studio is too busy,

338
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,959
and I cannot go back.

339
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,599
Fanlv.

340
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,400
Dad.

341
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,760
You're pregnant,

342
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,359
why do you still
drive to work by yourself?

343
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,640
Where is Xiangyuan?

344
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,400
He drives you every day, doesn't he?

345
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,359
I sent him on an errand,

346
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,599
and he went out early in the morning.

347
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,560
Really?

348
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,920
He didn't bully you, right?

349
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:49,839
Him?

350
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,760
No, he treats me like a bodhisattva.

351
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,479
Don't worry.

352
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,839
Do you know who is

353
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,359
the model husband in our company?

354
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,719
Mr. Lin, right?

355
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,439
Of course.

356
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,479
Mr. Lin is so nice to Miss Jiang
to be nominated for "Touching China".

357
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,599
After Miss Jiang gets pregnant,

358
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,800
Mr. Lin even doesn't
dare to speak loudly.

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
-Hello, Mr. and Miss Jiang.
-Hello, Mr. and Miss Jiang.

360
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,079
Dad, don't listen to their nonsense.

361
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,160
Xiangyuan treats you well,

362
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,800
and everyone sees that.

363
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,719
But you should have
a sense of propriety,

364
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,239
or they will think that

365
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,040
the Jiangs do not educate you well.

366
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,520
Mr. Jiang.

367
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,839
Mr. Lin is coming.

368
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,880
Fanlv,

369
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,000
here are the yellow crab
and chicken porridge

370
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,359
I bought especially for you.

371
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,119
I walked several blocks to get these.

372
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,880
Eat while they are still warm.

373
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:52,479
Xiangyuan,

374
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,119
come to my office later.

375
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,040
Ok.

376
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Let's go.

377
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,959
Xiangyuan,

378
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,719
I see
that you have been treating Fanlv well

379
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
in the last few months,

380
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,079
and I'm delighted.

381
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,239
Mr. Jiang, I promised you that

382
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,560
I'd be nice to her.

383
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,520
And I will treat you as my own father.

384
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,560
That's all I should do.

385
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,520
As a parent,

386
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
my biggest wish is for my daughter

387
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:29,280
to marry a good man.

388
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,359
If you and Fanlv can

389
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,920
live a peaceful life,

390
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,199
it's the greatest filial piety to me.

391
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,560
About the mistakes you made,

392
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,479
take warning

393
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,199
and never do that again.

394
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,640
I understand.

395
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,719
Tomorrow,
I will go abroad on a business trip,

396
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,479
and may not be back until New Year's Eve.

397
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,959
During my absence,

398
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:56,640
you take charge of the company.

399
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,359
Mr. Jiang, don't worry.

400
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,280
I will not disappoint you.

401
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,479
Bro,

402
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,319
what are you thinking about?

403
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,439
It seems that my father is really sick.

404
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
I didn't know my father might be sick,

405
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,680
until the day
Auntie Shao gave me this photo.

406
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,000
To say the least,

407
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,479
if my father is good,

408
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,119
why doesn't he come to see me?

409
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Bro,

410
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,719
I know you are painful.

411
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,439
But all people living in this world

412
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,839
are painful more or less.

413
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,040
You should hide such pains
in your heart.

414
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,920
The more painful it is,

415
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
the more you have to live well

416
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,520
when you go out

417
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,640
in the future,

418
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,280
and the more you can endure now.

419
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,599
Mr. Lin, you have obvious dark circles.

420
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,359
Are you Ok?

421
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,719
Were you too tired last night?

422
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,319
Take care of yourself.

423
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,959
Lin Xiangyuan.

424
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,119
Lin Xiangyuan.

425
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,479
What are you doing
in the midnight?

426
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
Can you just sleep silently?

427
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,119
How can I fall asleep

428
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,479
when you keep snoring like that?

429
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,040
Don't be angry.
I will sleep on the sofa.

430
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,119
Annoying.

431
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,959
Can you just sleep silently?

432
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,319
How can I fall asleep

433
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,800
when you keep snoring like that?

434
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,880
Yes, it's me.

435
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:53,000
OK, I will notify Mr. Lin.

436
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,199
What?

437
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,560
Ning Weicheng said

438
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,760
Miss Jiang just threw up again
in the office,

439
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,599
so she asked for a month's leave.

440
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,439
He asked me to tell you this.

441
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,520
OK. Tell Ning Weicheng

442
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
to find someone to send her home.

443
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,079
Don't let her go alone.

444
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,239
OK.

445
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,280
He Qunfei was assigned to the data room

446
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,319
as a clerk

447
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,239
to do odds and ends.

448
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,319
You thought about firing him before,
didn't you?

449
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,479
But Miss Jiang stopped it.

450
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,239
How do you know that?

451
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,920
I know a lot of things.

452
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,280
You don't have to fire him.

453
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,040
You can transfer him to
the logistics department

454
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,800
to manage the cleaning
of the entire building, instead.

455
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,160
Make him inspect the hygiene every day.

456
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,800
You're so mean.

457
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,920
Mr. Lin, you complimented me again。

458
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,119
Let‘s go and talk.

459
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,560
Supervisor He, you mean I have to leave?

460
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,079
I'm surprised too.

461
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,400
You've just arrived in our data room
a few days ago,

462
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,880
and did nothing wrong.

463
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,800
But you see,

464
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,439
the executive office
suddenly issued an order

465
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,040
to transfer you to the logistics
department to manage the hygiene.

466
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,599
Maybe I shouldn't say that,

467
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,000
it's right for you to be loyal
to Mr. Lei,

468
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,560
but today is not like the old days.

469
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,959
You have to accommodate
yourself to circumstances.

470
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:37,239
Mr. Lin, Mr. Xie, what brought you here?

471
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,719
I'll get you two cups of tea.

472
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:47,359
Lin Xiangyuan, you're so mean
to get me in trouble on purpose.

473
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,160
Listen, a small-minded person like you

474
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,079
will never achieve great things.

475
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,119
Achieving great things or not

476
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,520
seems to have nothing to do with you.

477
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,119
But at least for now,

478
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,880
you have to do whatever

479
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,599
Mr. Lin wants you to do.

480
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,100
(Employee Job Adjustment Notice)

481
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,300
(Right position for you)

482
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,600
(Recruitment. Interviewees wait here)

483
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,199
Who is No. 10 He Qunfei?

484
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,760
Nice to meet you.

485
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,859
(He Qunfei)

486
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,439
Mr. He, I'm curious that

487
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
why do you leave Yutian

488
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,119
where so many people want

489
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,800
to work.

490
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,040
Because...

491
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
As far as I know,

492
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,880
you and the current CEO of Yutian,

493
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,479
Mr. Lin Xiangyuan, have disputes.
(Applicant)

494
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,599
That's not the case.

495
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,959
Then,

496
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,040
why do you apply for a job here?
(Interviewer. Assistant)

497
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Sorry, Mr. He.

498
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,640
You'd better go to another company

499
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,439
to take a chance,

500
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,239
or change the industry.

501
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,920
Thank you.

502
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,199
So beautiful a girl.

503
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,839
Me?

504
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,160
Of course, it's you.

505
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,319
What will we eat later?

506
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,760
As you want.

507
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,640
Eat…

508
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,640
Shangguan.

509
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,640
What a coincidence!

510
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,199
What a coincidence!

511
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,760
Who is this beautiful girl?

512
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,280
Hello, I'm his girlfriend.

513
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,400
She is my cousin.

514
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,439
Shopping with your cousin?

515
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,199
OK. See you.

516
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,359
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

517
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,760
What?

518
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,760
What do you mean?

519
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm your cousin?

520
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,199
Am I embarrassing you?

521
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,599
You misunderstood me.

522
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,239
This friend of mine

523
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,560
is gossipy.

524
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,560
If he knows that you're my girlfriend,

525
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,599
everyone will know that.

526
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,319
So what? Is it embarrassing

527
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,560
to have a girlfriend?

528
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,400
You just have fun with me?

529
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,760
What are you talking about?

530
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,959
I am true to you.

531
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,199
Even the sun and moon can see.

532
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,479
But...

533
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,880
I'm actually a very low-key person.

534
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,160
I really don't want to be
the subject of gossip

535
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,040
among those friends.

536
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,880
I swear,

537
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,599
if I'm not true to you,

538
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,280
I will...

539
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,439
All right.

540
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,119
I trust you.

541
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,079
Show me your smile.

542
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,280
No.

543
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,359
Smile.

544
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,040
No.

545
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,439
Smile

546
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm Ok.

547
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,520
I'm a little uncomfortable.

548
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,280
Can you send me back?

549
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,920
Hello, sir.

550
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,280
Look, highly paid recruitment.

551
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,840
(High Salary Recruitment)

552
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,719
OK.

553
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,839
Here?

554
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,479
Yes, here.

555
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,479
I've checked on the phone.

556
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:40,760
Right.

557
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,040
You didn't even tell our daughter,

558
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,199
but directly came to Shanghai.

559
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,640
You're not afraid of delaying her work?

560
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,359
-304.
-304.

561
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,839
301.

562
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,400
-301.
-Right, here.

563
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,400
Hello.

564
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,040
Hello

565
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,239
Who are you looking for?

566
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,280
Hello. We are looking for Du Xiaosu.

567
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,959
We... We're her parents.

568
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,640
We just came from our hometown.

569
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,199
Is she there?

570
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:07,599
Uncle, auntie.

571
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,520
How about you take a break?

572
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,959
Where is Xiaosu?
She's not at work?

573
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,800
Is she sick?

574
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:13,880
No, no,

575
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,239
Xiaosu is fine.

576
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,319
But she is not here now.

577
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,479
She went to the Leis' house
to look after the elderly.

578
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,839
The Leis' house?

579
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,800
To look after the elderly?

580
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,520
Mr. Lei, look.

581
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,479
This is your favorite
red bean and glutinous rice porridge.

582
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,160
There are so many red beans.

583
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,599
Come on, take a sip.

584
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:40,880
Are you Ok?

585
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,040
Let me wipe you off.

586
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,439
Go away.

587
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,520
I don't know you.

588
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,839
Don't you remember?

589
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,119
I'm the Marshmallow.

590
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,959
We're good friends.

591
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm not your good friend.

592
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,319
You're all bad people.

593
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,079
You imprison me here.

594
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,160
You want me to die.

595
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,079
Yuzheng, Yuzheng.

596
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,400
Get out.

597
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,239
Mr. Lei,

598
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,800
it's night time

599
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,280
over there now.

600
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,959
Mr. Lei is sleeping.

601
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,599
You'd better not to disturb him.

602
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,760
Let's go to the bed.

603
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,839
Have a rest, OK?

604
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,359
I'm not sick. I don't take medicine.

605
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,959
It's Ok. It's Ok.

606
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,880
Let me clean here.

607
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,719
Marshmallow.

608
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,479
I'm OK. I'm good.

609
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,159
Xiaosu, are you Ok?

610
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:40,679
Are you injured?

611
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,239
Dad, mom,

612
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,919
why did you come here?

613
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
If we're not coming,

614
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,959
how long are you going to
hide this from us?

615
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,159
So much has happened,

616
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,760
why didn't you tell us?

617
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,520
It's Ok.

618
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,959
Marshmallow,

619
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,879
who are they?

620
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,479
Mr. Lei, don't worry or panic.

621
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,479
They're my parents, not bad people.

622
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,199
-Come here.
-Good people, good people.

623
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,120
You said you were busy and cannot
go back home during Spring Festival,

624
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,120
so this is what you were busy for.

625
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,719
I can't believe you were lying to us.

626
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,080
If I and your father didn't see this,

627
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,560
we will never believe that

628
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,399
you're an accompanying nurse now.

629
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,840
Yes, Xiaosu,

630
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,879
how could you lie to us?

631
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
A girl in your company told us

632
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,159
that you were here.

633
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,879
I wanted to tell you this before,

634
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,320
but...

635
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm afraid I can't explain it clearly.

636
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:46,959
Tell us,

637
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,159
what's the relationship
between you and Lei?

638
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,959
If there is nothing between you,

639
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,360
why do you take care of his father?

640
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:57,520
We're friends!

641
00:35:57,919 --> 00:36:00,320
If the family of my friend have trouble,

642
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:01,919
I should help take care of them.

643
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,159
Help take care?

644
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,520
You think I don't know?

645
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,479
I have inquired before I came.

646
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,000
You and your friend in the jail...

647
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,399
Mom, keep your voice down.

648
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,639
Mr. Lei doesn't know about it yet.

649
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:15,800
Go back with me right now.

650
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:17,840
No, I can't go.

651
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,600
Mr. Lei is here alone,

652
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,760
and the butler went out.

653
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,040
I have to stay here.

654
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,080
Marshmallow, I want to watch TV.

655
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
OK, I'm coming.

656
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,760
I really can't go.

657
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:27,439
How about this?

658
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,919
You two go back first.

659
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,840
When the butler comes back,

660
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,280
I will go back. Ok?

661
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,320
Fine.

662
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,320
Listen to Xiaosu. We go back first.

663
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
What's done is done.

664
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,560
No hurry in this moment.

665
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,320
You...
I don't know what to say about you.

666
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,159
Let's go.

667
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,639
Go.

668
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,439
The Big Head Son and Little Head Father
is going to start.

669
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,520
Hurry up.

670
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,560
Let's go.

671
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,439
Go, go, go.

672
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,399
She is so...

673
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,000
Don't be angry.

674
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,360
Your daughter is playing the fool,

675
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,719
and you didn't stop her

676
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,040
but helped her instead.

677
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,919
I didn't help her.

678
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,919
No matter how serious the matter is,

679
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,479
we can't make a noise
in other people' home.

680
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,120
Isn't it right?

681
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,399
She's been spoiled by you.

682
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:08,719
You both...

683
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,439
It's weird.

684
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,520
Does Xiaosu like Mr. Lei?

685
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,199
Don't think so much.

686
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,600
Let's talk to her
after she comes back home.

687
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,159
She must give us a good explanation.

688
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,679
Maokai, move.

689
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,280
I'm coming.

690
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,399
Mr. Lei,

691
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,280
let me pour you a cup of tea.

692
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,239
No, I want yogurt.

693
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,120
OK, yogurt.

694
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,719
But you have to drink medicine

695
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,239
after drinking yogurt, Ok?

696
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:24,879
It's not for you.

697
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,000
Ok, Ok, Ok.

698
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,399
Ok. Drink only one.

699
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,479
Drink.

700
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,000
Auntie Shao, you're coming.

701
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,479
What's wrong with you?
You don't look very well.

702
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,239
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

703
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,800
It's him.

704
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,600
You often come here?

705
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,959
I come here sometimes
when I'm at work.

706
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,840
Come and sit.

707
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,199
Waiter,
open a bottle of champagne.

708
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,360
Sit over here.
Don't be so far away from me.

709
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,399
Come on.

710
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,199
It's Ok.

711
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,040
Sir, here is your champagne.

712
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,919
Thank you.

713
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:25,800
He Qunfei?

714
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,919
Why are you here?

715
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,919
He Qunfei.

716
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,040
You're Du Xiaosu's friend, right?

717
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,959
He is Du Xiaosu's friend.

718
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,199
We met before.

719
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,679
Why are you here?

720
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,040
Part-time job.

721
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,080
I'm on probation.

722
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,760
I don't know if they want me or not.

723
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,600
What a coincidence today.

724
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,479
So many acquaintances have met here.

725
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,199
Is this Assistant He?

726
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,280
Why are you here?

727
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,959
Part-time job, right?

728
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,479
That's reasonable. I'm afraid
the low salary of a cleaning supervisor

729
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,360
can't even be enough to pay the rent.

730
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,919
Look at what you're wearing.

731
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,879
Is the small red bellyband

732
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,120
comfortable?

733
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:16,919
Mr. Lin,

734
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,239
if Lei Yuzheng sees that

735
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,239
Assistant He services us,

736
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,919
what will he think?

737
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:25,840
Qunfei,

738
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,439
your bar is not good,

739
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,239
as such assholes can come in.

740
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,000
Who are you cursing?
