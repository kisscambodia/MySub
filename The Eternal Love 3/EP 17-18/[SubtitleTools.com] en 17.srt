16
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,380
(Mo Residence)

17
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,599
Father.

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,839
Lian Cheng and Qu Tan Er know
you're about to get married,

19
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,239
and they've been visiting every day,

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,399
are you really not going to see them?

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,080
No matter what they do,

22
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
it's all fake.

23
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,200
It's better if everyone lives
their own lives, unbothered.

24
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,959
Yan Chen,

25
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,399
I had been strict with you before,

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,520
but it was all for the Mo family.

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,959
I hope you're sincere and genuine

28
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,360
about your marriage this time.

29
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,800
If you're reluctant in any way,

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,440
you don't have to.

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
Father.

32
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,679
I was too naive before,

33
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,679
being tied down by love and romance.

34
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,479
After marrying Eldest Princess,

35
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,160
I will strictly follow your teachings.

36
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,959
Have you made up your mind?

37
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,399
Father, I'm willing to follow you

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,440
to do all that I can for the Mo family.

39
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,560
So I haven't been wrong about you.

40
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,200
Although you're kind and gentle,

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
you have great ambition.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
Like father, like son.

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,839
My Lord. Young Master.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,319
The bridal sedan chair
has arrived at the front doors.

45
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,560
It's time for us to leave.

46
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
Father,

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm leaving.

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,839
Go.

49
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,400
So Qu Mei Er gets to marry Mo Yan Chen eventually,

50
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,240
her wish has finally been fulfilled.

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,439
Eldest Princess is indeed
passionately devoted.

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,559
Wishing those who are passionately devoted

53
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,039
get their feelings returned,

54
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,080
and those with genuine feelings

55
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,719
could be blessed.

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,479
Their marriage

57
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,240
isn't just about love.

58
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,400
Mo Yuan Long must have a hand in it.

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,400
Exactly, Your Majesty.

60
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,999
Now that Mo Yuan Long has two pillars of support,

61
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,800
I wonder how he will lay things out.

62
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,960
It's time to drop the bait.

63
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
The Spring Hunt

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,920
has always been an occasion during
which all noblewoman and soldiers

65
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,319
show their skills and abilities.

66
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,240
If this year,

67
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,520
it is changed to an open competition
between the two princesses,

68
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,159
where the winner gets abundantly rewarded,

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,319
when the time comes,

70
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,840
those who are restless will
definitely make their moves.

71
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,719
I knew

72
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,640
these wedding robes
would suit you the best.

73
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,400
All these years, I have

74
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,319
failed to return Your Highness's feelings.

75
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,240
Can you call me Mei Er?

76
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,319
Mei Er.

77
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,719
Finally, I've got you.

78
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Only when cold nights and heavy storms come

79
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,599
do I find out

80
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,080
that only you're willing
to give out everything for me.

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,759
Unfortunately,

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
so much unfairness exists in the world.

83
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,039
Being a man,

84
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,680
my fate is not up to me.

85
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,159
I will forever protect you and cherish you.

86
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
I won't let anyone harm you.

87
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
By Her Majesty's will,

88
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,120
now that all is peaceful,

89
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,479
although

90
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,800
you no longer need to be
fighting at the battlefields,

91
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,360
soldiers

92
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,719
cannot slack off,

93
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:41,759
and training

94
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
cannot be neglected.

95
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,240
Eldest Princess, Second Princess,

96
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,719
as successors to Dongyue's throne,

97
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,840
you should not lose to the generals

98
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,759
in terms of physical strengths and abilities.

99
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,840
A new way to die?

100
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Hurry up.

101
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,319
After a discussion with the officials,

102
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,359
this year's Spring Hunt

103
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,799
will be a competition for both of you,

104
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,840
Eldest Princess and Second Princess.

105
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,640
There will be two categories,

106
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,679
the first is Into-the-clouds Archery.

107
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,520
The second is a showdown with weapons.

108
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,799
It will take place

109
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,919
at the royal training grounds ten days from today.

110
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,759
The winner will be granted

111
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,600
the position of the Commander
of the Capital Guards.

112
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,799
I will not let Her Majesty down.

113
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,119
I will do my best.

114
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,799
I just want to

115
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,559
be a laid-back girl in peace,

116
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,960
why does my life have to be
so bloody and tiring every day?

117
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,480
Commander of the Capital Guards?

118
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,200
Whatever.

119
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,759
I don't want to be in command anyway.

120
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,679
How do I get through

121
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,759
all these tests and exams?

122
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,720
Since Eldest Brother has
chosen to remarry Qu Mei Er,

123
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,879
it is highly possible

124
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,799
that he has joined forces with Father.

125
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,319
If Qu Mei Er earns this position,

126
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,600
Father

127
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,960
could fall into the empress's trap.

128
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,799
Are you saying

129
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,200
that Her Majesty is trying to

130
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,280
draw a snake out of its nest?

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,480
Look at you, being so worried.

132
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,999
As long as I win the competition,

133
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,359
there won't be any issues.

134
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,600
But the problem is

135
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,040
that you and Qu Mei Er are

136
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,119
six of one, half a dozen of the other.

137
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,040
It's difficult to tell who will win.

138
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,879
This isn't a competition between the disciples,

139
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,359
but one between the masters.

140
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,759
So do you mean that

141
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,400
when I don't have my memories,

142
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,960
I cannot be compared

143
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,520
to that omnipotent Cheng Cheng?

144
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,040
I didn't say that.

145
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,439
When can you quit this habit

146
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,799
of being jealous of yourself?

147
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,080
Starting tomorrow,

148
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,040
preparations need to be made.

149
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,119
In my opinion, when you don't have your memories,

150
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,879
it should be six of one, half a dozen of the other.

151
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,799
Prince Consort.

152
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,559
Prince Consort.

153
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,480
Princess has been attacked, Prince Consort.

154
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,359
Princess has been attacked.

155
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:31,960
Princess, hang in there.

156
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
It's bad.

157
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,160
Jing Xin.

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
Quickly, tell me what happened.

159
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,799
Tell you what?

160
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,919
Show that you care about me, Mo Lian Cheng.

161
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,720
Okay, okay.

162
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,640
Princess,

163
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,319
hang in there.

164
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,400
Today...

165
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,799
it's sunny today, with birds
singing, flowers blooming.

166
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,160
Her Highness was in a great mood

167
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,319
and wanted to go to the bookshop to buy

168
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,960
some secret martial arts manuals.

169
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,799
On our way there,

170
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,799
we passed by...

171
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,679
we passed by a narrow alley.

172
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,999
Seven or eight assassins came out of nowhere

173
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,759
and surrounded Princess.

174
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,759
I unsheathed my blade

175
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,840
and fought them

176
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,600
to death.

177
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Unfortunately,

178
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,720
Princess and I

179
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,160
were outnumbered.

180
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,080
So,

181
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,400
Princess

182
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,999
was almost torn into pieces on the streets,

183
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:26,999
and almost

184
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,400
died on the spot.

185
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
Jing Xin is such a drama queen,

186
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,559
adding fuel into the fire.

187
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,720
Jing Xin, you are highly skilled then,

188
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,879
there's not even

189
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,200
a speck of dirt on you.

190
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,439
Thank... thank you for your praise, Young Master.

191
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,520
Princess.

192
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,720
Since

193
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,999
Princess is so badly injured,

194
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
then help Her Highness

195
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,200
back to rest.

196
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,119
Don't!

197
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,200
It's better to have Her Highness

198
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,759
rest in the Snow Court.

199
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,759
I'll leave now.

200
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,439
I feel terrible.

201
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,200
This sweet and sour scent

202
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,520
comes from top-grade plum juice.

203
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,040
I can't think about that much.

204
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,520
Let me turn this place upside-down.

205
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:16,080
Mo Lian Cheng!

206
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
Aside from laughing at me, what else can you do?

207
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,319
If you're so smart,

208
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:18,919
why don't you

209
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,919
compete

210
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,879
and fight for the military command?!

211
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,400
Putting all the pressure on me,

212
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,879
how can you call yourself a man?

213
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,919
Oh, no.

214
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,480
Was that too much?

215
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,439
Why isn't he angry yet?

216
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,600
Is my firepower still too low?

217
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:38,840
Look.

218
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,919
Isn't it said

219
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,160
that loving someone

220
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
means loving everything about that person?

221
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,200
In sickness and in health, for richer and poorer,

222
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,439
in success and in failure.

223
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,119
Why do you only allow me to succeed but not fail?

224
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,480
What you've said before

225
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,759
are all lies!

226
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,840
Oh, no.

227
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,960
Was that too hurtful?

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,999
What if I can't get him to forgive me?

229
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,439
When did I ask that of you?

230
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
It's you

231
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,520
who wanted to win the competition for me.

232
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:08,759
Is he praising me

233
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,559
for caring about him?

234
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,119
I know

235
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,759
you weren't serious about what you've just said.

236
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,319
You just

237
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,160
wanted me to worry,

238
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,439
to get angry,

239
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,999
as well as

240
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,280
to recover my memories.

241
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,799
Then tell me,

242
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,080
how can I help stimulate you?

243
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,200
How are you so certain

244
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,040
that the me without memories

245
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,239
cannot teach you martial arts?

246
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,200
Is it that in your heart,

247
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,559
your husband is such a man?

248
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,400
You've really

249
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
become similar to me.

250
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,640
This confidence of yours

251
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
is just like mine.

252
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,480
Even though I'm not that good at martial arts,

253
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,400
it should be more than enough

254
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,799
to beat Qu Mei Er.

255
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,520
Okay.

256
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,999
What are you doing?

257
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,319
You haven't hit the target in three shots,

258
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,840
you don't deserve a horse.

259
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,160
Even the horse is saying I'm not worthy,

260
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
I should just give up.

261
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,200
Actually,

262
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,840
the accuracy of your shooting is there,

263
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,200
you're just lacking

264
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,239
the acuity for finding the target quickly.

265
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
There is no shortcut to that skill.

266
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,720
Practicing hard is the only way.

267
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,960
I can keep practicing,

268
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,319
but I want a reward.

269
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,239
I don't want much,

270
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,600
a kiss is enough.

271
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,119
If you don't agree, I won't practice anymore.

272
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,319
Pay attention to the target.

273
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,280
Satisfied?

274
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:44,759
Satisfied.

275
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,119
Now,

276
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,720
you've developed the acuity for finding targets.

277
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,919
But during the competition,

278
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,239
the venue will be larger and
the targets will be higher,

279
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,160
which means the shooting range will be wider.

280
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,640
So,

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,040
you cannot slack off during the training.

282
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,720
Can't you encourage me?

283
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,960
You always put pressure on me.

284
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,640
So what if the shooting range is wider?

285
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,200
I can still do it.

286
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,319
Your Highness,

287
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,999
keep on practicing.

288
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,840
A narrower shooting range

289
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,679
means

290
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,759
higher accuracy.

291
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,600
Then, if I know the direction of the serve

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,760
and run to the closest shooting position,

293
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,240
wouldn't it all come together?

294
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,319
I don't want to practice anymore,

295
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,319
let me take a break.

296
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:57,840
Have you

297
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
run out of energy

298
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,439
or is it that you just don't
want to practice anymore?

299
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,760
If you want to become one with your sword,

300
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,639
you have to first fuse the qi of the sword

301
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,200
into your blood.

302
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,480
What on earth are you talking about?

303
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,240
In my opinion,

304
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,120
I'm just not compatible

305
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,240
with this sword skill.

306
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,559
That's ridiculous.

307
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,480
How about

308
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,559
I teach you a set of sword skill?

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,039
Let me show you what it really means

310
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,519
to be one with your sword.

311
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
What sword skill?

312
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,960
The Flirting Sword Skill.

313
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,600
Every move

314
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
requires to be flirting.

315
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,080
Come on.

316
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,200
What odd sword skill was that?

317
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,399
You know too little,

318
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,760
there's so much more.

319
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:56,120
What?

320
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,039
The Lovey-dovey Sabre Skill.

321
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,240
The Blazing Passion Palm.

322
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,240
When the time comes,

323
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,799
I'll teach you everything.

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,760
Let me remind you.

325
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,880
In order to win the competition,

326
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,439
Qui Mei Er

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,399
has been training under Mo Feng Yang

328
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,720
at the Mo Residence every day.

329
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:16,960
If you keep slacking off,

330
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,639
you'll suffer a crushing defeat.

331
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,439
You really can't take a hint.

332
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,159
Fine, I'll practice.

333
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,679
Why bring up Qu Mei Er?

334
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,279
It's bad luck.

335
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
Don't come closer.

336
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,679
We have to be an arm's-length apart.

337
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,039
You finally recovered your memories last night.

338
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,399
What if you come close to me,

339
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,960
feel that happy sweetness,

340
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,880
and lose your memories again?

341
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,000
You're really full of yourself.

342
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,600
Does every single person who touches you

343
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,559
have to fall for you?

344
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,399
At least it's true for you.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,760
Otherwise,

346
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,679
why have you been so attached to me every night?

347
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm telling you,

348
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,159
stop provoking me with your dissatisfaction,

349
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,360
otherwise,

350
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,439
you'll suffer the consequences.

351
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,279
Originally,

352
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,960
I had given up on trying

353
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,919
to recover your memories.

354
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:18,159
But who knew

355
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,880
just casually mentioning my dissatisfaction

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,080
would really work?

357
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:21,679
You...

358
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,600
Alright, I'll stop.

359
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,960
You're about to go into battle.

360
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,480
Relax, face your opponent with a clear head.

361
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,679
No matter what the results are,

362
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,080
you'll always be

363
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,240
the most extraordinary Princess in my heart.

364
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,039
What are you doing?

365
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,679
Cannot surpass

366
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
an arm's-length apart.

367
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:52,519
One two one. One two one.

368
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,480
One two one. One two one.

369
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,559
Halt.

370
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,159
May Second Princess be

371
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,360
ever-victorious, ever-triumphant,

372
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:08,120
ever-invincible, ever-glorious!

373
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,720
Ever-victorious, ever-triumphant,

374
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,399
ever-invincible, ever-glorious!

375
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,519
Ever-victorious...

376
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840
The first round, Into-the-clouds Archery.

377
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,919
When the drumming stops, service will begin.

378
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,880
The one who hits more cloud balls

379
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,679
will win.

380
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,480
Launch.

381
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,439
East, west, centre, west, west, east.

382
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
Take this.

383
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,399
The rules state that six balls
are served at once.

384
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,200
Follow these directions when you serve.

385
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
East, west, centre, west, west, east.

386
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,279
If you have to serve twelve at once,

387
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,039
serve in the reverse order after the first six.

388
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:25,399
Don't worry,

389
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,159
no one will notice.

390
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,279
Launch.

391
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,240
Launch.

392
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,039
Launch.

393
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,600
Launch.

394
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:05,880
Launch.

395
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,919
Second Princess Qu Tan Er

396
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:43,840
has hit six.

397
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,240
Eldest Princess Qu Mei Er

398
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,039
has hit three

399
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,399
and missed three.

400
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,799
Second Princess wins.

401
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,120
Did you secretly hire an expert?

402
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,840
Otherwise, how could you have

403
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,600
improved so much in just ten days?

404
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,120
I don't need to hire any experts,

405
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,279
my Prince Consort has been helping me train.

406
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,519
That's more than enough.

407
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,279
Mo Lian Cheng?

408
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,399
Impossible.

409
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,159
He's merely a man.

410
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,399
He probably can't even hold up
a bow and arrow properly.

411
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,159
Why can't men hold up bows and arrows?

412
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,639
Men are born weak.

413
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
Second Princess, why do you have
to make irrational arguments?

414
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,439
Eldest Princess, you think that

415
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,200
men are born weak,

416
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,519
but I cannot possibly agree.

417
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,360
How about this?

418
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,559
In the next round,

419
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,279
let my Prince Consort Mo Lian Cheng

420
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,559
face off with a female general,

421
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,319
in order to

422
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,919
prove whether it is really as you said

423
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,720
that men are born

424
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,240
weaker than women.

425
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,919
Your Majesty,

426
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,120
this is against the order
and principles of society.

427
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
This...

428
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,679
wouldn't this become a joke?

429
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:57,399
What?

430
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,760
Is everyone here worried

431
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,159
a mere man such me

432
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,960
would defeat a female general?

433
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,919
I agree

434
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,679
on this match.

435
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,360
Prince Consort is very courageous.

436
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,360
I would not like to go too far.

437
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,080
How about I compete with you

438
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:22,319
without weapons?

439
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,279
Thank you for your compassion.

440
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,319
Please.

441
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,080
How dare you look down on my Cheng Cheng?

442
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,240
Wait to have your butt whipped.

443
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,519
Good job, Mo Lian Cheng.

444
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,919
Cheng Cheng.

445
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,919
Prince Consort, you have kept
your skills well-hidden,

446
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:39,960
I want to know

447
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,840
whether I will also be defeated by you.

448
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,240
Cheng Cheng.

449
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,919
Prince Consort, in your opinion,

450
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,639
who should be declared

451
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,279
the winner of that match?

452
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,679
The results are obvious to all.

453
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,519
Your Majesty won.

454
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,799
Second Princess, do you disagree?

455
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,639
Prince Consort was defeated by Your Majesty,

456
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,279
I accept defeat.

457
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:37,600
Official Xiao,

458
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,960
what were today's results?

459
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,200
Bring him in.

460
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,639
Second Princess,

461
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,310
(First: east, west, centre, west, west, east
Reversed: east, west, west, centre, west, east)

462
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,471
care to explain?

463
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
My apologies, Second Princess.

464
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,639
I've admitted everything.

465
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:30,519
I...

466
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,760
My skills are lacking

467
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,200
and my intentions were dishonest.

468
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,600
I coerced the soldier

469
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,279
to serve the balls in the set directions.

470
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,679
It's all my fault,

471
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,799
may Your Majesty have mercy on him.

472
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,760
You are quick to admit your wrong-doing.

473
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,799
Flog him 80 times,

474
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,639
and oust him from the Palace.

475
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

476
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,960
I'll take care of your family.

477
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
Since Second Princess

478
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,080
has lost both rounds,

479
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,000
the position of the Commander
of the Capital Guards

480
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,840
will be Eldest Princess's.

481
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,319
Thank you, Your Majesty.

482
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,840
I will not betray Your Majesty's trust.

483
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,000
Defying rules, cheating in public,

484
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,679
disregarding the morals of men,
and violating cardinal guides and virtues.

485
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
Second Princess Qu Tan Er,

486
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,839
you are grounded

487
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,000
and are forbidden from entering the Palace.

488
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,159
Your Majesty,

490
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,159
handing military command over to
Eldest Princess this time

491
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,359
will definitely remind Qu Tan Er

492
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,560
to thoroughly understand
the importance of the big picture

493
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:24,599
and be more obedient

494
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:25,960
to Your Majesty from now on.

495
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,119
With a ghastly appearance like this,

496
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,639
how could I blame him for not recognizing me?

497
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,320
Your Majesty,

498
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,399
are you speaking of Young Master Lian Cheng?

499
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:48,960
Today,

500
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,839
when I was fighting him,

501
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,159
my memories from before

502
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,879
all came back to me.

503
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,639
I am certain that

504
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,119
Mo Lian Cheng

505
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,399
is the Young Master Lian Cheng
I have been looking for.

506
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,839
Your Majesty.

507
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,000
Perhaps you are tired,

508
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,000
you must not over-exert yourself.

509
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,599
I cannot wait any longer,

510
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,119
I want him back by my side now.
