16
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,000
By the grace of heaven's will,

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,200
Her Majesty hereby proclaims that

18
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,280
Qian Prefecture has been struck
by a great drought,

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,800
thus, granary will be opened

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,039
for the people in need.

21
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,399
The climate is unpredictable.

22
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,000
People are the foundation of a nation.

23
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,800
Everyone

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,479
must show sympathy for the living.

25
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Starting tomorrow,

26
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,119
men from noble families of the city

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,839
must enter the palace to pray for one month.

28
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,920
The end.

29
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,360
Long live Her Majesty!

30
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,959
Superstitions.

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,160
Message from Her Majesty.

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,479
Eldest Princess is newly wedded.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
Prince Consort Mo Yan Chen is
exempted from the prayer.

34
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,399
I'm grateful for Her Majesty's grace.

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,319
Hold on.

36
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,640
You said all men from noble families
in Dongyue must join.

37
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,839
Is my husband Mo Lian Cheng included?

38
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,679
Certainly.

39
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,440
But...

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,720
My husband has been ill recently.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It would be bad if his conditions
displease Her Majesty.

42
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,160
Tan Er.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,080
Are you trying to cause Official Xiao trouble

44
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,119
or are you disobeying the imperial order?

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,520
I don't care.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,599
I must see Her Majesty.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a message from Her Majesty.

48
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,399
Mo Lian Cheng

49
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,959
must join the prayer.

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,160
No.

51
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,399
I must put on everything I can.

52
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,560
We...

53
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,319
We need money everywhere we go.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,920
I need Yu Hao and Jing Xin to help me out.

55
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,360
I must bring all my jewelry with me.

56
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,520
I'll carry whatever I can take.

57
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,440
Cheng Cheng.

58
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,119
Help me out now.

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,319
Tan Er.

60
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:43,840
Even if you run away now,

61
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,920
where can you go?

62
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,120
I couldn't care so much.

63
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,479
We must leave first.

64
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,920
Her Majesty

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,599
is clearly doing this because of us.

66
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,879
This is your fault!

67
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,559
This is all thanks to your amnesia.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,039
Look at what happens now.

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,559
I can't enter the palace for one month
unless I am summoned.

70
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,520
You will be trapped inside the palace
for one month.

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,640
Her ill intention

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,840
is too apparent.

73
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't worry about it.

74
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,120
I can

75
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,479
take good care of myself.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
You mentioned it before.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,520
We are only here

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,479
because of the Soul-guarding Bead.

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
It's likely we'll need it for our return.

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,120
Moreover,

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,439
the Soul-guarding Bead

82
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,559
is the treasure of the Qu family.

83
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,479
Her Majesty holds the most power in that family.

84
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,960
My guess is,

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,999
the bead

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,279
might be inside the palace.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,879
I am entering the palace,

88
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,920
so I can ask around.

89
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,240
Maybe we can leave this place sooner.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,840
But you haven't regained all of your memories.

91
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
You don't know martial arts either.

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm worried.

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
I may not have my memories,

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,719
but ignorance gives me courage.

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,319
That makes the operation easier.

96
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
Her Majesty is now

97
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,599
obsessed with you.

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
What if she...

99
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,719
A man must always

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,559
protect himself out there.

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't worry.

102
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,360
It's only one month.

103
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,479
Right!

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
Take this dagger with you.

105
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,879
Use it for protection.

106
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,800
Tan Er.

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,319
While I am away,

108
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,279
beware of Her Majesty

109
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,559
and Eldest Princess.

110
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,279
I am now a princess too.

111
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,800
My status is different now.

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,360
Don't worry.

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
I will miss you a lot.

114
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:06,910
(Jingyi Pavilion)

115
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,759
Her Majesty asked for you,
Prince Consort Lian Cheng.

116
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,879
Please come with me.

117
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,879
I haven't finished copying the scripture.

118
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,759
Her Majesty's order must be followed at once.

119
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,520
Tan?

120
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,039
Tan, wake up.

121
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,719
No.

122
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,400
Tan, wake up!

123
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,439
Tan!

124
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
Wake up!

125
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,080
You're finally awake.

126
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,120
Tan.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,120
What happened?

128
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,920
You were shouting loudly.

129
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
I was so worried.

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,239
I'm glad it was just a dream.

131
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,280
No.

132
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,200
He's been in the palace for days.

133
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
Why haven't I heard from him?

134
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,080
Jing Xin.

135
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,720
Ask around in the palace.

136
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,119
Yes. I'll go now.

137
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,999
Rest well.

138
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,439
I'll order the kitchen to make some
food to calm your mind.

139
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,119
Cheng Cheng...

140
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,960
(Why is Her Majesty dressing like this?)

141
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,679
As usual, I'll address you

142
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,439
as Young Master Mo.

143
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,919
Is that all right?

144
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,999
I'm in a mood for pitch-pot today.

146
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,480
Are you willing

147
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,679
to play with me?

148
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,319
I'm afraid

149
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,799
this isn't appropriate.

150
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,520
When did you ever worry about what's appropriate?

151
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,879
Let's have a wager.

152
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,160
Whoever loses

153
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,559
must answer the winner a question.

154
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,799
You have my word.

155
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,439
Each of us gets three arrows.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,679
The player with the best scores wins.

157
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,239
Why do you think?

158
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,239
Your Majesty can decide.

159
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,319
Young Master Mo.

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
One point for me

161
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,960
and one point for you.

162
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,879
When did you learn how to play pitch-pot?

163
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,919
I...

164
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,679
never knew.

165
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,119
Is there anything you can't do?

166
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm flattered.

167
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,319
Whether it's chores or managing a household,

168
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,679
I know nothing.

169
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,679
This is intriguing.

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,679
You share similarities

171
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,080
with someone I used to know.

172
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,759
He didn't know these either.

173
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:19,999
I appreciate the compliment.

174
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,280
Bearing any resemblance with
Your Majesty's friend

175
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,879
is an honor.

176
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
The difference is

177
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,840
he was never reverent and respectful

178
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,400
to me like you.

179
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,879
He and I

180
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,319
shared everything together.

181
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,480
We went through ups and downs together.

182
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,799
We went on adventures

183
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,759
and explored the unknown.

184
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,040
The joyous moments we had

185
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,640
are now...

186
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,480
a distant memory.

187
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Your Majesty is the ruler of the nation.

188
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,359
It's my duty

189
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,559
to show my respect for Your Majesty.

190
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,040
As for

191
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,999
Your Majesty's old friend,

192
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,840
I wouldn't dare...

193
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,359
to make any comments.

194
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,960
Young Master Mo,

195
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:17,720
you are now well-versed in rites

196
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,319
and manner.

197
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,999
But during the sparring test,

198
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,080
what made you say such impulsive words?

199
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,520
I was ignorant of the consequences.

200
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,160
Your Majesty's punishment was wise.

201
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,759
I've learned from my mistake.

202
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,480
Perhaps...

203
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,759
after I met Second Princess,

204
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,319
I've come to know love.

205
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,600
That changed me.

206
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
You've changed so much

207
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,679
over time.

208
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,960
I lost.

209
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,480
I was lucky.

210
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,600
Tell me.

211
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
What do you want to know?

212
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,520
Rumors say that

213
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,879
the royal Qu family of Dongyue

214
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,759
has a priceless bead.

215
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,239
It can change destiny

216
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,400
and reshape reality.

217
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,840
Has Your Majesty

218
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,759
ever heard of it?

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,799
I've never heard of it.

220
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,119
Where did you learn

221
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,400
such rumor?

222
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,799
That was foolish of me.

223
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,799
I thought

224
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,080
the novel's story was real.

225
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,160
I apologize.

226
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,319
The weather is hot today.

227
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,759
I'm sweating very badly.

228
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,520
May I have Your Majesty's permission

229
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,359
to get changed?

230
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,359
Go ahead.

231
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
I take my leave.

232
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,119
He was playing pitch-pot with Her Majesty!

233
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,559
I'm jealous!

234
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,799
I'm sure he has reasons to do so.

235
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
After all, it was Her Majesty who invited him.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,319
He can't disobey her order.

237
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,400
This is driving me crazy!

238
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,119
Jing Xin.

239
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,879
Bring me my 40-meter long

240
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,919
great spear!

241
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,400
Your Highness.

242
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,559
So I do have one?

243
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,160
Good.

244
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,520
Jing Xin.

245
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,160
We should carry this spear

246
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
and break into the palace!

247
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,919
Tan.

248
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
No matter what you want to do,

249
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,040
I'm willing to do it with you.

250
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,080
But this...

251
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,840
Can we reconsider it?

252
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,040
I could be spotted even I dress like this.

253
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,679
If you went in there...

254
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,319
What's wrong with me?

255
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,759
Are you looking down on me?

256
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm stating the truth.

257
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,359
How dare you!

258
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,319
How dare you make fun of me!

259
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,600
Stand still!

260
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,919
Don't you dare!

261
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,720
Don't you mock me again!

262
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,359
Sorry!

263
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,319
Please, have mercy!

264
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,480
I won't do it again.

265
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,559
That's more like it.

266
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,239
We must figure out a way

267
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,319
to sneak into the palace.

268
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,840
I got it.

269
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
You must

270
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,919
play along with my performance.

271
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,520
Go get it ready for me.

272
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,280
Sure.

273
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,559
Tan.

274
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,919
Be careful when you do it.

275
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,080
Got it. Got it.

276
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,799
I am the queen of real estate.

277
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,359
This is a walk in the park for me.

278
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,520
Start gathering the people.

279
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:19,999
Bring them here

280
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,359
to save me in time.

281
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's do it.

282
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,080
Slowly.

283
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,760
Hold tight.

284
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,600
Cheng Cheng.

285
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,039
I'm risking my life for you.

286
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,880
Stay steady.

287
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,120
I'll get some help.

288
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Go on.

289
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,240
Oh, no!

290
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:52,760
Help! Help!

291
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,559
Her Highness is hanging herself
to commit suicide!

292
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,120
Save...

293
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,279
This is bad!

294
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,279
Her Highness is hanging herself...

295
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,399
Your Highness!

296
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,600
Your Highness!

297
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,600
Your Highness!

298
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,000
Your Highness! Are you all right?

299
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Your Highness!

300
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,559
Are you all right?

301
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,399
Are you hurt?

302
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:10,880
Your Highness! Are you hurt?

303
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,799
Is Your Highness hurt?

304
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,840
Jing Xin.

305
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
You fail at everything.

306
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,840
You almost got me killed.

307
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,279
Is it my fault?

308
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:21,439
Her Highness is safe now.

309
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,760
Dismiss. You may go now.

310
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,840
Dismiss.

311
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:24,559
Okay.

312
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,159
Let's go.

313
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,080
Tan.

314
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,159
I will not take part in this kind of plan again.

315
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,519
It's too dangerous.

316
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,240
If something bad happened to you,

317
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,360
I would be blamed for it even if I die!

318
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,279
I had to make the play convincing
so that I can fool others.

319
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,039
Don't worry.

320
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,039
I can handle it.

321
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,240
Are you sure?

322
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,799
Are you sure you're alright?

323
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Let me see it.

324
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,159
Your Majesty.

325
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,720
Second Princess tried to commit suicide
in her residence.

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,039
She said she's let Your Majesty down

327
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,439
and if she can't enter the palace,
her life is pointless.

328
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,120
It's making waves.

329
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:20,319
Young Master Mo, are you not worried at all?

330
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Her Highness and I have made a promise

331
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,399
that we will take care of ourselves

332
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,960
and reunite after the prayer is over.

333
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,559
It seems like Your Majesty and Official Xiao

334
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,720
have work to discuss.

335
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,600
I shall

336
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,159
take my leave now.

337
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Your Majesty.

338
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,600
Our next move...

339
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,159
Mo Lian Cheng has changed drastically.

340
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
Something is amiss.

341
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:04,319
Also,

342
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:06,679
he seems to know

343
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,480
I have the Soul-guarding Bead.

344
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,120
How is that possible?

345
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
Unless he is Young Master Lian Cheng.

346
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,960
But after I sounded him out,

347
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,279
it did not feel like him.

348
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,600
Whatever the case is,

349
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,399
tighten the security around my bedroom first.

350
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:27,240
Yes.

351
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,639
I'll get it done.

352
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,679
Why haven't we heard anything from the palace?

353
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,080
Does Her Majesty not care if I'm dead or not?

354
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,240
Then why did she send me the tonic?

355
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,159
Tan.

356
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,760
Keep it down when you say that.

357
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:53,639
What if...

358
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,279
What if Her Majesty

359
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,039
has seen through your plot?

360
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,360
No way.

361
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,080
Let's go.

362
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,919
There must be a way

363
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,639
for me to get into the palace!

364
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,439
Hold on.

365
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:06,919
You...

366
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,840
When you walk around the place,

367
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
be mindful of your behaviors.

368
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,120
You can't be so intimate with a guard.

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,200
That is not appropriate.

370
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,399
This guard

371
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,439
can't do anything.

372
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,240
Let's go.

373
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,000
Please let me in.

374
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,960
Take this money.

375
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:22,880
I really can't do it.

376
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,080
My superior forbid you from entering.

377
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,080
Please don't make things difficult for me.

378
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,439
Why can't you let me in?

379
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm a princess.

380
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,760
Do you know how much money I'm holding?

381
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,080
Take it.

382
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,880
Your Highness.

383
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
If you have to...

384
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,439
I can...

385
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,399
No! Stop!

386
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,399
Forget it.

387
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,399
I'm grateful for your consideration.

388
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,279
I have an idea.

389
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,039
You can

390
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,000
let Her Highness enter alone.

391
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,000
I can't do that.

392
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,120
She will be on her own.

393
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,000
The palace is huge.

394
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,159
Even if she sneaked in,

395
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,319
no one would notice.

396
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,319
What happened?

397
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,600
Lady.

398
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:06,880
Your veil looks gorgeous.

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,319
I really can't let her in.

400
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:47,919
Halt!

401
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,679
Foreign officials cannot

402
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,639
ride on carriages inside the palace.

403
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:51,319
Officials must step out

404
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,279
of the carriage and be examined.

405
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:54,080
How dare you!

406
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,200
General Pugu will be late to present
himself to Her Majesty!

407
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,600
Will you take responsibility?

408
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,919
Tell them

409
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,159
that I will not

410
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,559
step out of the carriage.

411
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,279
Move aside.

412
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,240
I apologize, General.

413
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,720
Her Majesty has an order for us.

414
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,760
You may stay in the carriage

415
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,039
and be exempted from the examination.

416
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,200
Our rookie

417
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,159
doesn't know the rules.

418
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,519
Please stay in your seat.

419
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,279
But other members of your convoy
must be examined

420
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,799
to prevent impostors from sneaking in.

421
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,240
(Crap.)

422
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,080
Isn't this the classic story

423
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,919
of saving a damsel in distress?

424
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,399
I love it.

425
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,159
What?

426
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,600
You just have to make me get off the carriage?

427
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,760
You've misunderstood, General.

428
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,399
I was merely...

429
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,120
I know every member of my convoy.

430
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,639
You don't need to worry.

431
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.

432
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,840
You're safe.

433
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,760
You may go now.

434
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,760
Pal.

435
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,799
Thank you.

436
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,880
Don't mention it.

437
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,559
What if I was an assassin?

438
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,120
Judging by your aura,

439
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,319
you don't know martial arts.

440
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,480
That's very nice of you.

441
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,919
No sweat.

442
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:51,919
It was no big deal.

443
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:54,639
You may go now.

444
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,519
Sure.

445
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,760
I'll see you

446
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:57,919
when I see you.

447
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,360
Cheng Cheng is copying the scriptures.

448
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I don't get to see him.

449
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,840
Her Majesty

450
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,360
is meeting the officials.

451
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,399
She's not here either.

452
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,080
Great.

453
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,639
This is my chance

454
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,919
to find out whether Mo Lian Cheng

455
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,559
had any intimate experience

456
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
with Her Majesty.

457
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
So far,

458
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,799
it's looking good.

459
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,919
I haven't found a single hair.

460
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,559
This bed looks comfortable.

461
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,639
I should get one for myself.

462
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,399
What is happening to me?

463
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,439
Could it be...

464
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,960
that I skipped my meal

465
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,840
so my blood sugar level is too low?

466
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,919
I'm all right now?

467
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,439
Why didn't you make any noise when you walk?

468
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,039
You almost gave me a heart attack!

469
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,639
Your Highness disobeyed the order

470
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,439
and broke into Her Majesty's bedroom.

471
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,120
What is your agenda?

472
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
I can go wherever I want.

473
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,319
It's none of your business.

474
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,760
I miss Her Majesty.

475
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,319
So I came to see her.

476
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,120
I know she is busy right now.

477
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,279
I'll come back again.

478
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,120
I must have seen it right just now.

479
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:44,279
But Second Princess

480
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,039
doesn't seem to know the truth.

481
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,439
I am Pugu Yun Xiu.

482
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,559
Greetings, Your Majesty.

483
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,200
Has your ruler told you

484
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:04,880
whom you will be marrying

485
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,840
after you've arrived?

486
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,760
As told by my lord,

487
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,399
Your Majesty always made

488
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,880
the best decision.

489
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,840
My fate

490
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,439
is Your Majesty's to decide.

491
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
However,

492
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,039
I've come here as a sinner.

493
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,519
This might come as offensive for Your Majesty.

494
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,319
If Your Majesty is unwilling,

495
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,960
I can explain everything to my lord.

496
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,760
Not at all, General.

497
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,159
The Pugus is a noble family in Xiyue.

498
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,519
You belittle your status

499
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,240
by admitting to being a sinner.

500
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,080
Victory and defeat are both common in battle.

501
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,679
I quite admire

502
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,720
your talents and skills.

503
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,159
I appreciate the compliments.

504
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,559
I am worried.

505
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,399
But I am aware that my actions

506
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,279
are usually out of line.

507
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:48,319
I'm afraid

508
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,600
any woman who marries me

509
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,880
will be frustrated.

510
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,639
Perhaps...

511
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:53,919
I understand.

512
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,880
You refuse to have a peace-making marriage.

513
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,480
You wish to break the treaty
between the two nations.

514
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,799
I wouldn't dare.

515
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,279
I never want to break the treaty.

516
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:06,840
I upset Your Majesty.

517
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,639
I deserve punishments.

518
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,159
I believe

519
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,519
Xiyue's goodwill in the negotiation.

520
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,360
I have no children to call my own.

521
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,760
But one of my nieces,

522
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:23,600
Second Princess Qu Tan Er still
hasn't officially selected

523
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,360
the main prince consort.

524
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,519
I've heard of that.

525
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,760
Her Highness has a kind heart.

526
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,360
She is gentle and intelligent.

527
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,240
Very well.

528
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,399
You shall be her main prince consort.

529
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,720
Be ready.

530
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,679
Two days from now,

531
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,399
you will have the wedding.

532
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,200
Your Majesty.

533
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,200
I can only dream of marrying Her Highness.

534
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:51,960
Moreover,

535
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,760
this might be too sudden.

536
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,639
I'm afraid if I make any mistake,

537
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,679
I might embarrass Her Highness.

538
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,600
I will send you more manpower to get it done.

539
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,200
All you need to do

540
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:05,480
is to wait for the wedding.

541
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,480
That settles it.

542
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,000
(I can't disobey the empress's order.)

543
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,159
(There is nothing I can do now.)

544
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,360
I shall

545
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:21,600
obey the order.

546
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,720
General Mo.

547
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,000
It's been a long time.

548
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,439
How are you lately?

549
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,639
General Pugu.

550
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,840
I'm fine.

551
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,720
I hope you won't cause any trouble

552
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,080
for this peace-making marriage.

553
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,039
General Mo.

554
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:55,880
It was a misunderstanding.

555
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:57,039
I...

556
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,519
I only believe what I see.

557
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,880
Pugu Yun Xiu.

558
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,039
You are in the Kingdom of Dongyue.

559
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:03,880
If you cause any trouble,

560
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,639
it will take more than a marriage to resolve it.

561
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,799
General Mo.

562
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,679
I don't want any further misunderstanding.

563
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:11,960
Back then...

564
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm not interested.

565
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,760
So long, General Pugu.

566
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,639
Judging by that look,

567
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,919
you never found anything?

568
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,360
Indeed!

569
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,279
Jing Xin.

570
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,000
What should I do?

571
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
An imperial order has arrived!

572
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,639
Is she going to punish me for
sneaking into the palace?

573
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,639
Jing Xin.

574
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,120
How severe is the offense?

575
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,919
Your whole family might be executed.

576
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,760
An imperial order for Second Princess.

577
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,159
As decreed by Her Majesty,

578
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,399
Second Princess Qu Tan Er of Dongyue

579
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,760
is graceful with her beauty, wise with
her knowledge and manner.

580
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,039
However, she hasn't selected
a main prince consort yet.

581
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,720
Yun Xiu from a noble family in Xiyue

582
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,039
is courteous and respectful.

583
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,360
He is now of age to get married.

584
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,319
Second Princess and Yun Xiu are
a match made in heaven.

585
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,159
He will be betrothed to Second Princess and
granted letters and robes by Her Majesty.

586
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,679
The wedding will be completed two days from now.

587
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,319
The will of the people decides the nation's fate
and thus the royal family's fortune.

588
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,559
May the couple work to contribute

589
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,319
to the nation and live up to
Her Majesty's expectation.

590
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,679
The end.

591
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,960
Second Princess Tan Er, accept
the imperial order.

592
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,399
I accept the imperial order.

593
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:46,840
Congratulations on obtaining
the main prince consort.

594
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,760
I'll take my leave now.

595
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,240
Yun Xiu?

596
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,840
The man who is here for a peace-making marriage?

597
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,240
The man with a beard?

598
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,760
How could it be such a coincidence?

599
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,200
Could it be he knew it already?

600
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,279
So he saved my neck to please me?

601
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,240
Is that so?

602
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,919
I'm not a trash can!

603
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,760
Why should I take in everyone?

604
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,279
I quit!

605
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,960
Young Master.

606
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,279
What about we probe for a few more days?

607
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,159
I will be leaving the palace soon.

608
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,159
As of now,

609
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,439
the only place I haven't searched

610
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,639
is Her Majesty's bedroom,
which is heavily guarded.

611
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,919
I must start searching now.

612
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,200
I will go with you then.

613
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,480
If you stay,

614
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
you won't draw any suspicion.

615
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,000
The continent of Dongyue covers various states.

616
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,079
Women have more power in all states.

617
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,679
All the states wages war on each other.

618
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,879
The farmland sees no harvest.

619
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:50,000
People are starving and suffering.

620
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,720
In the southwestern region of Dongyue,

621
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,679
the Mo family sets up canteens and schools

622
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,320
and welcomes refugees of
the neighboring states

623
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,800
to go to the southwestern region.

624
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,119
Until formidable women from the Qu family
rise to emerge as a new force

625
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,800
and join hands...

626
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,040
with the Mo family

627
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,560
to unite Dongyue under one reign
with their force.

628
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,200
The name of the regime is Xihe.

629
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,839
The Qu family enforces new laws

630
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,399
to terminate all forms of fiefdom.

631
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,159
A new system that employs officers
is implemented instead.

632
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,639
An empress becomes the ruler.

633
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,359
Their idea diverges from that of the Mo family's
which is to return the power to the people.

634
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:50,919
And then

635
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,200
the head

636
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,000
of the Mo family dies from a heart attack.

637
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,280
The Mo family...

638
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,919
falls from their grace.

639
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,800
One, two, three.

640
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,480
Sit on my shoulders.

641
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,000
Again.

642
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,359
Come on.

643
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,200
One, two, three!

644
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,639
Can you make it?

645
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,639
I can't hold it!

646
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,000
Are you all right?

647
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,879
This wall is too tall.

648
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,040
Jing Xin!

649
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
This is your fault.

650
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,800
You asked me to come and discuss it with
Cheng Cheng in the middle of the night.

651
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,919
If it was daytime,

652
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,599
I could just sneak into the palace.

653
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,520
You can't go over the wall because
you don't know martial arts.

654
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,119
Otherwise,

655
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,079
we could have just jumped over the wall.

656
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,240
Are you really so powerful?

657
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,399
Of course.

658
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:38,800
Then go ahead.

659
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,919
Fine.

660
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,720
Hold this.

661
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,679
Greetings, Your Highness.

662
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,000
Official Xiao.

663
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,480
Did you install

664
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,720
a GPS tracker on me?

665
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,560
Why do I keep seeing you everywhere I go?

666
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,159
It's late now. Shouldn't you be in bed?

667
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,359
Are you here to scare us?

668
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,119
I know why Your Highness

669
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,599
is trying to break into the palace.

670
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,000
But sadly,

671
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,040
your effort is in vain yet again.

672
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,280
How do you know?

673
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I came here

674
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,280
to discuss an urgent matter with Her Majesty.

675
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,599
Take me to her.

676
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,599
Prince Consort trespassed into the forbidden
ground and was trapped there.

677
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,439
He might be in grave danger.

678
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,639
There are many deadly contraptions there.

679
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,320
Prince Consort is carrying injuries.

680
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,839
Without my help,

681
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,760
he might lose his life.

682
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,359
If Your Highness

683
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,320
could return to your residence and
await the wedding,

684
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,320
I will go to his rescue personally.

685
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,079
Why should I trust you?

686
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,480
