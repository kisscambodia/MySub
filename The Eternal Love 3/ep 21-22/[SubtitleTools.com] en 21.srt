start caring about details?

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,800
Prince Consort, why are you being

so gentle tonight?

80
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,070
Didn't you say

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
that you like Dongyue gentlemen?

82
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,910

being wild and uninhibited

suits you

00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,080

91
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,350
Do you still have a headache?

92
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,000
Did you stay here the entire night

93
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
because you were worried about my headache?

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You might've caught a cold

95
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,470
from getting drunk last night.

96
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,950
I'm fine.

97
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,560
You should go back to your room and rest.

98
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,320
I need to handle some emergencies.

Feng Yang.

101
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,950
In fact,

102
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,270
there is one thing

103
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,350
that you don't know.

104
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,000
This sword buckle doesn't represent

105
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
peace.

106
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,270
What does it represent then?

107
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,470
My heart.

108
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,030
Prince Consort, do you know
what you are talking about?

109
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,680
Feng Yang.

110
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,470
I fell in love with you

111
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,510
on the battlefields long ago.

112
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,440
When I was forced to have a peace-making marriage,

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,510
the only thought that supported me

114
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,350
was being able to meet you again.

115
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,510
I can overcome

116
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,200
all misunderstandings and barriers.

117
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,590
The only thing that supports me

118
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,470
is seeing you again.

119
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,950
You are Main Prince Consort of Second Princess.

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,080
You've consummated your marriage
on the wedding night.

121
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,910
How can you say such inappropriate words?

122
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
The marriage wasn't consummated.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,910
Princess.

124
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,030
What do you mean?

125
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,830
On the wedding night,

126
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,270
everything Yun Xiu did

127
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,680
was for Officer Xiao to see.

128
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
Instead of consummating the marriage,

129
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,120
he made a deal with me.

130
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,560
If I help him pursue you,

131
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,320
he would help me annoy Mo Lian Cheng.

132
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,800
You were acting.

133
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,350
Acting is an expedient measure.

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,240
But my feelings are genuine.

135
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,030
If your feelings are genuine,

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,470
then you wouldn't have
hidden the truth from everyone,

137
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,000
and manipulated others like your puppets.

138
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:35,950
Feng Yang.

139
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,640
Shut up.

140
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
I don't want to see you anymore.

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
Neither do I want to hear you calling my name.

142
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,510
I'll move out of Princess's Residence immediately.

143
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,800
Good luck to you.

144
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,240
Feng Yang.

145
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,880
Maybe she is just

146
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,800
being stubborn,

147
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
her heart could be attracted already.

148
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,390
We'll leave her alone

149
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,320
for a few more days.

150
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,510
Let her realize how she really feels.

151
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
Maybe she'll come back to you.

152
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,590
No, no, no.

153
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,350
I think we've used

154
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,240
enough tactics.

155
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,440
Do you really think

156
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,510
Feng Yang cannot tell

157
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
that all our tactics were targeting her?

158
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,470
I think,

159
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,680
at this moment,

160
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,880
you should put yourself in her shoes.

161
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,240
Open your heart to her.

162
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,270
Now the person who has
their heart closed is not Yun Xiu,

163
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,320
it's Mo Feng Yang.

164
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,510
If you can really put yourself in each other's shoes,

165
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,710
you will realize

166
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,830
that in a relationship,

167
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,710
if tactics that you look down on are missing,

168
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,150
it will be boring.

169
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,240
Are you talking about Yun Xiu or me?

170
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,800
Even though we have been married for a long time,

171
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,440
you should still use some romantic measures

172
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,120
to keep our love fresh.

173
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,800
I thought

174
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
you love me for who I am.

175
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,830
This is different.

176
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,270
Asking you to be a little more romantic

177
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,880
can turn you into a different person?

178
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,270
Are those superficial things
that important to you?

179
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,560
Are things that you don't understand

180
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,800
superficial?

181
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,320
You don't even want to answer me now?

182
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,150
In this world,

183
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,880
no relationships are the same.

184
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
No relationships

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,470
are comparable.

186
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
Is asking you to be a little more romantic

187
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,710
and to make changes

188
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,350
this difficult?

189
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,680
You always think

190
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
about what makes you happy.

191
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,710
Have you thought about what makes me happy?

192
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,470
Alright, alright.

193
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,240
Don't think you're the only one
who can walk away,

194
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,830
I can too.

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,510
Why have you left out all the "yun"s

210
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,080
in the poem?

211
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,390
What are you doing here?

212
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,240
I...

213
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,510
I know you haven't eaten for the whole day.

214
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
I came to ask you to go eat.

215
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,950
How did the character "yun"

216
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,320
annoy you?

217
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,950
Go away.

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,470
Jing Xuan.

219
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,440
Did she

220
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,350
really not eat for the whole day?

221
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,640
And when she was practicing calligraphy,

222
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,510
did she intentionally avoid the character "yun"?

223
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,830
Why do you look so happy?

224
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,760
She didn't let me tell Father anything.

225
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm so worried.

226
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,800
Tell me once again.

227
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,390
Which poem was she writing over and over again?

228
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
"Ocean makes all other waters unworthy of the name,

229

230
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,510
Don't worry.

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,830
I promise

232
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,390
that after telling her one sentence,

233
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,760
she'll recover immediately.

234
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,510
What sentence?

235
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,590
See you at five o'clock by Wangyou Lake.

236
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,510
That's it?

237
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,950
That's it.

238
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
You're in charge of telling her.

239
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,270
I'm in charge

240
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,240
of making a miracle happen.

241
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:20,910
This...

242
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,270
Be quick.

243
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,000
Be quick, be quick.

244
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,390
Yun Xiu.

245
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,230
Stop practicing.

246
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,680
Save your energy for meeting Mo Feng Yang

247
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,110
at five o'clock.

248
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,560
Did she finally ask me out?

249
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,840
Not yet.

250
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,080
But if you follow my instructions,

251
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,320
five o'clock

252
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
will be the moment that determines your fate.

253
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,200
Someone should stay away,

254
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,480
or our tactics will

255
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,150
lower his level.

256
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,870
You're here.

257
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,080
It looks like

258
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,840
he used your tactics

259
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,320
against you.

260
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,110
What do you mean?

261
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,360
Playing hard to get.

262
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,480
Intentionally giving you the cold shoulder.

263
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,270
Well.

264
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,750
Then

265
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
don't ever talk to me again.

266
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,270
After seeing the clouds of Wushan Mountain,

267
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
how can I still

268
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,990
look at other clouds?

at my most embarrassing moments?

294
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,150
You don't need to hide your fragility from me.

295
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,480
Everyone has

296
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,080
extravagant hope

297
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840

298
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,720
Mine is

299
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,270
in front of me now.

300
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,150
Therefore,

no matter how much the world has changed,

302
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,600
I won't let you go.

303
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,150
However,

304
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,360
if it's a natural moat,

305
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,870
you will be crushed into pieces if you fall.

306
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Her Majesty has already passed an order

307
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,030
to encourage men to marry again,

308
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,200
and awards them perfume sachets as encouragement.

309
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,320
So, if we are on the same side,

310
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,360
we can overcome natural moats.

311
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,680
Give me three more days to think about it.

312
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm always directing romantic plays for others.

313
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,800
My heart is broken into pieces.

Damn that Mo Lian Cheng.

315
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,080
It's good you still have a conscience.

316
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,680
Sad tears.

317
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,150
Twinkling eyes.

318
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,150
Looking scared.

319

Warmest heart.

320
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,080
Passion for my chest muscles.

321
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,360
These are a hundred reasons

322
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,200
why you attract me.

323
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,480
Let me see what else you wrote.

324
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,440
Before,

325
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,990
I was not romantic enough.

326
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,390
I promise

327
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,990
from now on,

328
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,360
I won't let you be jealous of
other people's relationships.

329
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,080
I forgive you

330
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,480
since

331
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,960
you like me touching your chest muscles.

332
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,320
However,

333
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,030
sometimes you misunderstand me too.

334
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,600
I just forgave you,

335
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,480
and you're at it again?

336
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,110
Okay, okay.

337
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,440
Which one is your favourite?

338
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,720
My favourite is the one

339
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,990

Ever since the time

345
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,600
Her Majesty punished you because of
the equal-rights movement,

346
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,960
I knew

347
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
I wanted to be

348

♪Our fates will forever remain entangled♪

359

Your Majesty.

360
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,480
Information from Second Princess's
Residence indicates

361
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,440
that Second Princess wants to repudiate

362
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,390
Prince Consort,

363
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,390
and is trying to bring him and General Mo together.

364
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,840
How can Yun Xiu and Feng Yang

365
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,360
let her manipulate them?

366
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,390
According to my investigations,

367
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,230
before Prince Consort came to
marry Second Princess,

368
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
he had feelings for General Mo.

369
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,720
Therefore, Second Princess made an excuse

370
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,960
to ask General Mo to stay over at her residence

371
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,320
and created opportunities for them.

372
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,150
So...

373
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,680
She wants to overcome the scheme of disunity

374
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,720
and make generals from two countries work for her.

375
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,630
Your Majesty.

376
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,600
Your Majesty.

377
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,510
Your Majesty.

378
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,870
Does she think

379
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,030
I'll let her do whatever she wants?

380
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,800
Your Majesty.

381
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,390
Don't hurt yourself

382
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,560
because of anger.

383
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,910
Take me to the Altar of Souls.

384
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,750
But you are not in a stable condition,

385
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm afraid...

386
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,200
Be quick.

387
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,680
Yes.

388
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,990
Your Majesty.

389
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,230
Be careful.

390
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,150
The Altar of Souls is still under construction.

391
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,680
You are not in a stable condition,

392
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
don't risk your body's limits.

393
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Your Majesty.

394
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
Your Majesty.

395
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,870
Is it possible that the spiritual power
has backfired?

396
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,150
Your Majesty.

397
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Right now,

398
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
someone must control
the Soul-guarding Bead with me

399
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,390
to wake Her Majesty up.

400
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,600
She

401
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,270
may be the only hope.

402
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,500
(Princess's Residence)

403
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,150
It has been a while, but she still hasn't responded.

404
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,600
Could she have gone back on her words?

405
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,200
No,

406
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,630
I can't just wait here.

407
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,960
I need to go talk to her

408
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,480
to understand her thoughts.

409
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,990
Too much concern is as bad as too little.

410
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,150
You need to trust her.

411
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,680
You need to give Feng Yang time to think.

412
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
We don't have the time.

413
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,750
Of course I trust Feng Yang,

414
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,750
I just don't know what I could do

415
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,230
if I keep waiting like this.

416
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,150
Don't worry.

417
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,510
You will become

418
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,230
an excellent chess player.

419
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,110
Official Xiao has arrived.

420
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,560
So all three of you are here.

421
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,480
Greetings.

422
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,750
Official Xiao, what are you

423
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,990
doing here?

424
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,870
Her Majesty issued an emergency order

425
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,510
to summon Second Princess to the palace.

426
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,560
Emergency order?

427
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,600
Do you know what for?

428
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,030
I do not.

429
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,110
Official Xiao, would you please

430
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,630
wait in the front hall?

431
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,440
Prince Consort,

432
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,960
show Official Xiao the way.

433
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,390
Second Princes, please be quick.

434
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,320
Oh, no.

435
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,800
Could it be that Her Majesty knows

436
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,630
that we want to bring

437
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,030
Yun Xiu and Feng Yang together?

438
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,960
Even if she has noticed,

439
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,270
she can't do anything to you

440
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,510
if she doesn't have evidence

441
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,910
and you deny it.

442
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,990
Reading your facial expression,

443
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,510
could there be

444
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,510
more serious issues?

445
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,150
I have a strange feeling.

446
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,630
Her Majesty intentionally led me to investigate

447
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,080
the Altar of Souls.

448
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,110
She must have noticed

449
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
that you have a special connection

450
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,990
with the Soul-guarding Bead.

451
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,750
This is such a grand scheme.

452
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,360
She wants us

453
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,270
to walk right into a trap ourselves.

454
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,200
Her Majesty will be inpatient

455
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,990
if Your Highness doesn't go soon.

456
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,800
Anyhow, keep in mind

457
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,440
that the Bogu Shelves in the imperial chamber

458
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,600
have a set of drawers.

459
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,750
Pushing the second one inward

460
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,230
can open the secret passage to the Altar of Souls.

461
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,560
If not out of absolute necessity,

462
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,230
don't get close to it and don't touch it.

463
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:22,910
Because

464
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,360
if you get close to the Soul-guarding Bead,

465
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,870
the bead will react.

466
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,390
Her Majesty will notice

467
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,230
and you will be in danger.

468
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,390
Okay.

469
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,750
I'll figure out Her Majesty's intentions.

470
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,920
Before that,

471
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,880
don't let her

472
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,950
get anything disadvantageous on you.

473
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,710
If not out of absolute necessity,

474
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,360
wait until

475
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,950
I come.

476
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,230
Okay.

477
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,600
Your Highness.

478
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,360
Let's go.

479
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,510
Does Her Majesty know about us?

480
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,670
Calm down.

481
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,430
I'll ask Feng Yang

482
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,640
if anyone has leaked information.

483
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,010
(Mo Residence)

484
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,080
Eighth Brother.

485
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,840
Didn't you say that I have three days
to think it through?

486
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,920
Her Majesty summoned Tan Er to the palace.

487
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,160
What is that for?

488
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,120
Xiao Zhen knew but didn't say anything.

489
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,840
I'll find out what's going on in the palace.

490
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,750
Oh, right.

491
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,750
When you enter the palace,

492
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,950
even if it's not for this matter,

493
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,320
you should act accordingly.

494
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,560
If Yun Xiu and I implicated her,

495
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,800
I will apologize to Her Majesty.

496
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,840
Wait.

497
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,030
Why are there no guards here?

498
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,990
Where is Her Majesty?

499
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,470
This way, Your Highness.

500
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,470
Isn't this the secret passage to the Altar of Souls?

501
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,920
Cheng Cheng reminded me not to get close to it.

502
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,360
What is

503
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,470
this place?

504
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,190
It's not good for you

505
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,470
to pretend like you don't know.

506
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,120
You can feel the strange movements

507
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,230
within the Soul-guarding Bead,

508
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,430
so can I.

509
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,560
What pig?
[*In Chinese, "pig" has the same pronunciation as "bead"]

510
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,840
Why can you

511
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,470
feel the pig moving?

512
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,190
You must know what I'm talking about.

513
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,030
Keep acting like an idiot

514
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,030
doesn't do good to either of us.

515
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,360
What are you doing?

516
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,080
If Her Majesty knows you threatened me
with a sword,

517
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,670
she must...

518
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,840
Her Majesty knows everything.

519
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,950
Go in.

520
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,710
Her Majesty wants to see me

521
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,800
inside here?

522
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,800
Your Highness, be quick.

523
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,560
Her Majesty is going to be impatient.

524
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,840
Can't Her Majesty change the location?

525
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,160
This is too dark.

526
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,270
If my claustrophobia gets triggered

527
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,400
halfway,

528
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,920
my heart would stop beating,

529
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,950
I would die.

530
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,190
Disobeying Her Majesty's order

531
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,710
is also punishable by death.

532
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,470
Then I have to face the challenge.

533
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,800
I can't be beaten by fear.

534
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,270
Go on.

535
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,270
General Mo, are you here to see Her Majesty?

536
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,640
Her Majesty is not in the royal study.

537
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,400
Thank you for reminding me, General Lu.

538
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,190
However,

539
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,430
you look concerned.

540
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,670
Is something

541
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,710
wrong?

542
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,400
I heard

543
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,230
that Her Majesty never left her imperial chamber

544
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,990
and she refused to meet with any officials.

545
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,800
I heard that Her Majesty

546
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,190
just summoned Second Princess to the palace.

547
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,840
On my way here,

548
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,840
I did see Xiao Zhen bringing Second Princess

549
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,030
to the imperial chamber.

550
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,920
The strange thing is

551
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,320
that the guards were suddenly changed
at the imperial chamber.

552
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,270
Not only were the unnecessary people cleared,

553
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,430
but more armed forces were also added.

554
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,230
Something may be going on.

555
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,710
There are a few questionable points.

556
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,950
Don't worry too much, General.

557
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,510
Maybe Her Majesty wants to discuss
some government affairs with Her Highness

558
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,230
and doesn't want others to interrupt.

559
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
If that's the case,

560
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,470
maybe I thought too much.

561
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,750
