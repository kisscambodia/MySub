16
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,160
You lied to me!

17
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,320
Move.

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,439
Tan Er was summoned to the imperial chamber?

19
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,359
The security has been tightened as well?

20
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,439
Will Her Highness be in danger?

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,199
(It seems like my guess is right.)

22
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,160
(Her Majesty noticed)

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,040
(the relation between Tan Er
and the Soul-guarding Bead.)

24
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,120
(So she must have been taken)

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,279
(to the Altar of Souls.)

26
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,639
Tan Er!

27
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,919
(This is a serious matter.)

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
(I can't let them get involved in this.)

29
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,240
What's wrong?

30
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,760
It's nothing.

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,999
It's only a minor headache.

32
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,800
You knew Her Highness was taken there,

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,960
but you didn't tell us.

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,400
Trust me.

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,120
It's better for you not to know.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,880
Eighth Brother.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,760
Do not keep secrets from me again.

38
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Do you know

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,559
a place known as

40
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,919
the Altar of Souls?

41
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,040
I heard it was forbidden ground.

42
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,600
But I've never been there before.

43
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:37,919
I have no idea

44
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,279
whether it existed or not.

45
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,639
Not only does it exist,

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,560
its entrance...

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,079
is right inside Her Majesty's bedroom.

48
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,440
Why would Her Majesty summon
Second Princess to the Altar of Souls?

49
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,319
When I was in the palace for the prayer ritual,

50
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,000
I stumbled upon that place.

51
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,039
There is a strange bead at the altar.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
That bead

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
is closely related to Tan Er.

54
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,599
I think Her Majesty

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,960
wants to use this bead and Second Princess

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,199
to increase her might.

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
But she doesn't know

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,759
doing so

59
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,960
will put both of them in grave danger.

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,759
How did you find that place?

61
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,560
What exactly happened?

62
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,639
Back then,

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,879
Her Majesty

64
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,639
tried to alienate Second Princess and me.

65
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,560
She kept summoning me to the palace.

66
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
I had the chance to find that place.

67
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,879
I knew it.

68
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,840
Before I told you,

69
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,599
I knew you would have such a reaction.

70
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,520
But I told you nonetheless.

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,479
I just wanted to know

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
whether you are still

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
the same person

74
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,159
you used to be.

75
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,919
Do you expect me to break the law

76
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,400
and side with you blindly?

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,479
I only hope that...

78
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:47,560
you would think about

79
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,840
this matter from different perspectives.

80
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,159
Is it my fault?

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
Or should Her Majesty take the blame?

82
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,479
Eighth Brother!

83
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,919
From what I remember,

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,879
status and power

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
would never make you submit.

86
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,079
(The Soul-guarding Bead is really here.)

87
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,639
(So in this parallel universe,)

88
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
(the Soul-guarding Bead belongs
to the Qu family too.)

89
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,240
(Is she the host in this world?)

90
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,159
(Does it mean)

91
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,359
(Cheng Cheng and I can return
to our world with the bead?)

92
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,000
(Did the Soul-guarding Bead backfire on her)

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,159
(while harnessing its power?)

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,079
(But Xiao Zhen)

95
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,440
(brought me here)

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,039
(and forced me to admit)

97
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,599
(my relation with the Soul-guarding Bead.)

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,960
(Is he going to use me as a tribute)

99
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,599
(as Qu Jiang Lin did?)

100
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,759
(But I don't have the Soul-parting Xiao.)

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,000
Seems like

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,199
Your Highness remembers what bead this is.

103
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,919
As I expected.

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
More guards.

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,840
We need a decoy

106
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,359
to distract their attention.

107
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,879
Shift change.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
She changed her mind.

109
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,800
You can come out.

110
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll follow you inside.

111
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,960
After that,

112
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,199
I'll try to persuade Her Majesty.

113
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,639
If any of you tried to harm her,

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,840
I would not show mercy.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,280
Let go of me!

116
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,919
Do you really think

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,159
using me and the bead will be

118
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,919
enough to reawaken Her Majesty?

119
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,199
Don't you know the risks?

120
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
You know the secrets.

121
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,639
I do.

122
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,039
But I also know

123
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,520
whatever you plan to do

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,479
will only push Her Majesty and me

125
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,120
into deeper darkness!

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
But sadly,

127
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,479
Her Majesty is already deep in the darkness.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,320
Now,

129
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,359
let's see if you can save her.

130
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,279
The rumor about Her Majesty building a dungeon

131
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,560
to harness great power was true!

132
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Her Majesty

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,039
has more secrets.

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,919
The contraptions were shut down.

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,279
Something is amiss.

136
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,039
Be cautious.

137
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,680
Be cautious.

138
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,919
The spirit energy backfired on her.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
Xiao Zhen lied.

140
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,359
He wants to use Tan Er

141
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,479
to reawaken Her Majesty

142
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,599
with the power of the Soul-guarding Bead!

143
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,640
But if he fails,

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,880
Tan Er and Her Majesty

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,000
will both die.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,279
He forged a fake imperial decree.

147
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,440
That is treason!

148
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,120
Tan Er!

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Cheng Cheng!

150
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,959
Tan Er.

151
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,599
Mo Lian Cheng.

152
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,719
You trespassed the forbidden ground.

153
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,159
You should be executed for it!

154
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,080
You should face execution instead!

155
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,279
You hid Her Majesty's injury

156
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,240
and forged an imperial decree!

157
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,359
How dare you!

158
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,680
I was ordered by Her Majesty.

159
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,599
My plan

160
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,039
will save Her Majesty

161
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,760
without harming Her Highness.

162
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,279
But you, Mo Lian Cheng.

163
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,560
You planned a rebellion.

164
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
General,

165
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,279
you should help me arrest him!

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,599
I'll warn you again.

167
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,279
Underestimating the bead will bring

168
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,279
catastrophic consequences.

169
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,039
Both Her Majesty and Tan Er

170
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,399
will in grave danger!

171
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,959
Barely no one in the palace

172
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,240
knows the Soul-guarding Bead.

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,719
But you sounded like an expert.

174
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,479
Perhaps you had planned this long ago

175
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
to overthrow the throne!

176
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,200
Official Xiao,

177
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,800
it's time to put an end to this.

178
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,719
If you side with him, General,

179
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,200
then I shall

180
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,560
show no mercy for you.

181
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,959
Seize Mo Lian Cheng!

182
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,959
Cheng Cheng, watch out!

183
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,959
Cheng Cheng.

184
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,279
Your Majesty.

185
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,279
Tan Er.

186
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,599
Tan Er, hang in there.

187
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,200
Tan Er!

188
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,640
- Cheng Cheng.
- Tan Er!

189
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,359
Find a way home.

190
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,000
Protect our son.

191
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,880
Don't be silly.

192
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,640
As long as you're there,

193
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,159
no matter how dangerous it is,

194
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,320
that place will be our home.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,200
Without you,

196
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,200
no place can be called home.

197
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,120
I followed you

198
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,680
from one lifetime to another.

199
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,479
I would never abandon you

200
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,200
and go to a world you're not in.

201
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,279
Tan Er.

202
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,039
Hang in there.

203
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,479
How could you be so silly?

204
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,399
Now that I saved you,

205
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,839
let's go through this together.

206
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,560
Your Majesty.

207
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,440
This is all my fault.

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Watch out!

209
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,080
Cheng Cheng. Wake up!

210
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,120
Cheng Cheng.

211
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,039
Your Majesty.

212
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,039
(The mark from the backfire is gone.)

213
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,120
Wake up.

214
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,760
Cheng Cheng.

215
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
If anything happens to him,

216
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I will make you pay dearly.

217
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,080
Your Highness!

218
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,839
Lian Cheng!

219
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,120
You broke into the forbidden ground.

220
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,719
But you tried to protect Her Majesty.

221
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,359
Take her and leave.

222
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,640
When Her Majesty is awake,

223
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,519
I'll explain everything to her.

(comes from centuries of fate.)

229
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,599
(Our destiny of three lifetimes)

230
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,919
(is like a surreal dream.)

231
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,800
(We meet at the wall in three lifetimes,
the blossoms were falling like rain.)

232
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:20,800
(Our consummations in three different lifetimes
all ended on a canopy bed we shared.)

233
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,440
(The cycle of a nightmare brings about
a lifeless yearning.)

234
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,239
(Without sorrow from our parting,)

235
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279

Cheng Cheng?

255
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,360
It's been three days.

256
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,480
Why are you still in a coma?

257
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:44,360
As long as you can wake up,

258
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,680
I can serve you tea and give you
a massage every day.

259
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,639
I'll do whatever

260
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,080
you tell me to do.

261
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
I'll hold you to it.

262
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Cheng Cheng, you're awake.

263
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:15,680
Do you have to wait for me

264
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,159
to make such promises to wake up?

265
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,680
(Having memories from three lifetimes)

266
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,879
(is such a bizarre sensation.)

267
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,600
(The person in front of me)

268
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,720
(still looks the same,)

269
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,759
(but she has a much more important
place in my heart now.)

270
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,320
Well?

271
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
Does the wound still hurt?

272
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,919
(Maybe I should withhold from telling her)

273
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,840
(I've regained my memories.)

274
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,279
My wound...

275
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,519
Don't you remember?

276
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,960
Is this another amnesia?

277
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:54,960
I only remember

278
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,440
that at some point

279
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,440
Feng Yang came to me and told me

280
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,560
you were taken to the imperial chamber.

281
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,759
And then...

282
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,960
I saved you

283
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,840
and got hurt.

284
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,360
If I had known you remembered nothing,

285
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,200
I would have twisted the story a little.

286
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,320
Someone

287
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,119
should serve me tea...

288
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,239
and give me a massage.

289
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,639
Those are jobs for men.

290
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,440
I haven't done them in a long time.

291
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,519
What?

292
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,999
Are you already regretting it?

293
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,279
Not at all.

294
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
As long as you can wake up,

295
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,999
I will walk my talk.

296
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,239
Then...

297
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:46,720
Before I become normal again,

298
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,320
you must get used to this lifestyle of serving me.

299
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,480
When you're bossing me around,

300
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,239
it seems like

301
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,480
you do have your memories.

302
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
I think...

303
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,447
I lost my memories again.

304
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,080
Are you disappointed?

305
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,440
Certainly not.

306
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,879
Let me rub your feet.

307
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,720
You...

308
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,800
You don't need to be too sensitive.

309
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,080
I told you.

310
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,519
We will create new memories

311
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,879
together.

312
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,560
Do not be troubled by the memories you lost.

313
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
(When I lost my memories,)

314
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
(she was always concerned with my thoughts.)

315
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
(She even had to be careful with her words.)

316
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,840
Right.

317
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,720
Maybe you could

318
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,560
go on a walk with me in the garden.

319
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,080
You just woke up.

320
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,519
Why would you want to go there?

321
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:53,759
(To snuggle with you, of course.)

322
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,960
(Then we can create new memories.)

323
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I can't remember how long I've been in bed.

324
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,320
I want to stretch my limbs.

325
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,080
My injury really took a toll on me.

326
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,360
I think you might have to look after me

327
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,399
for the rest of my life.

328
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,039
At the Altar of Souls,

329
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,440
I thought I would lose you for sure.

330
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:30,919
But it seems like

331
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,759
as long as the worst has yet to happen,

332
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,360
whatever the future holds for us

333
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,519
will be great.

334
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,680
(After the life-and-death experience,)

335
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,720
(it's not just me,)

336
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,239
(she's changed a lot.)

337
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,200
(Perhaps I should tell her the truth.)

338
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,440
- But...
- Tan...

339
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,119
Cheng Cheng, seriously?

340
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:45,960
You...

341
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,440
You should lose some weight.

342
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,279
I'm tall.

343
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,999
My weight is just fine.

344
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,720
It's heavier now.

345
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,560
Are you messing with me?

346
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,480
How could you

347
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,919
doubt a patient?

348
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,759
You seemed to have no problem talking.

349
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,480
Maybe...

350
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,600
you're doing just fine.

351
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,999
You're giving me a heart attack.

352
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,279
The pain has become more intense.

353
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,879
(The way he fools around)

354
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,680
(looks exactly like Cheng Cheng
when he regains his memories.)

355
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,639
(Could it be...)

356
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,519
(he's faking his amnesia?)

357
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:35,560
(No.)

358
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,360
(I need to pry deeper.)

359
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,999
How did it get so serious all of a sudden?

360
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,680
Let me help you back.

361
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:43,960
I'll change your bandages.

362
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,399
Take it slowly.

363
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,039
Be careful.

364
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,879
I should change the bandage

365
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,159
on your arm too.

366
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,360
Didn't you lose your memories?

367
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,200
How do you know your left arm was hurt?

368
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,960
I...

369
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,200
I lost my memories,

370
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,399
but I didn't lose my mind.

371
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,480
It's natural

372
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,440
that I can feel the pain.

373
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,119
This is odd.

374
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
When we were at the Altar of Souls,

375
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,119
there wasn't any intimate contact.

376
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,480
How did you lose your memories?

377
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,639
I should ask you that.

378
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,759
How can I know

379
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,720
if you fondled with me?

380
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,759
You were the one who groped!

381
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,560
Me?

382
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,519
Groped?

383
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,440
See?

384
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,960
You know what groping means!

385
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,320
I...

386
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,840
You have your memories!

387
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,919
Fine.

388
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,039
If you were any more dim-witted,

389
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,600
I couldn't keep acting.

390
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,119
You scared me!

391
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,039
Right.

392
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,720
I need your help with an experiment.

393
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,399
No!

394
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,840
I don't want you

395
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,239
to lose your memories again.

396
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,519
When we

397
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,360
first met at the wall,

398
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,039
what did I call you?

399
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,159
I don't remember.

400
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,360
See?

401
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,239
You used yourself as a lab rat.

402
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,320
Look at you now.

403
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,119
You've undone all the progress.

404
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,519
Why don't you

405
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,639
ask me

406
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
why we signed an unbreakable pact?

407
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,840
And after we fell off the cliff,

408
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,279
how heartbroken I was?

409
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,560
In the Xuanling Continent,

410
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,919
we were forced to be apart.

411
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,999
How did I find you,

412
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:29,919
protect you,

413
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,759
and win your love?

414
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,039
Do you really remember everything?

415
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,680
I will never forget.

416
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
But you don't remember what I called you.

417
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,800
My Princess Consort is relentless today.

418
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,039
Perhaps I should

419
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
teach you some manner.

420
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,440
All right.

421
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,639
I know you remember everything.

422
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,639
I lost.

423
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,399
I also

424
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,440
have this strong feeling.

425
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,080
After we returned from the Altar of Souls,

426
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,960
the memory trigger malfunctioned.

427
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,279
I won't lose my memories again.

428
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,159
Are you sure?

429
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:24,320
While I was in the coma,

430
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,639
I saw the memories from my
three different lifetimes.

431
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,680
All of this

432
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,560
felt so real

433
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,960
as if I was experiencing it.

434
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,840
So for the rest of my life,

435
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,200
I won't lose those memories again.

436
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,119
That's great!

437
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,519
My dear Cheng Cheng has really come back to me.

438
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,840
I missed you so much.

439
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,759
Don't leave me again.

440
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,399
Please?

441
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,200
The spirit energy from the Soul-guarding Bead

442
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,119
made you remember all of it.

443
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,639
I tried to recall.

444
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,960
I arrived in this world several months

445
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,239
before you did.

446
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
Like my amnesia,

447
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,519
it must have been

448
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
the temporal disruption

449
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,239
the Soul-guarding Bead caused.

450
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Without my memories,

451
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,999
I couldn't have faith

452
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,480
in your promise.

453
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,919
I even...

454
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,200
doubted your intention...

455
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,600
and challenged your sincerity.

456
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,399
If you really gave up on me,

457
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,639
whatever the reason was,

458
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,519
I wouldn't blame you.

459
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,200
But when I saw...

460
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,399
how you never gave up on me,

461
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,039
I wished to hold you in my arm

462
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,879
as I am now.

463
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,919
I want to tell you...

464
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,560
I won't let you face the harsh reality alone.

I should visit him then.

No.

00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,639

00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:22,960
So

Eighth Brother

487

has recovered well.

488

You're an unmarried man.

00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,639
Eighth Brother has been married for half a year.

491

But they still love each other so much.

492

Of course I would envy them.

Eighth Brother,

517
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,480
are you sure you're alright?

518
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,159
Yun Xiu and I have been worried about you

519
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,080
every waking moment over the past three days.

520
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,440
Three days?

521
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,440
Every waking moment?

522
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,159
It seems like

523
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,960
you've given him your answer.

524
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,600
He risked his life for me.

525
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:27,159
I have no reason not to answer his kindness.

526
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,639
Don't worry.

527
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,039
I will find a right opportunity

528
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,320
to disown him.

529
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,720
I really have to thank you this time.

530
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,159
Don't mention it.

531
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,919
Other than the repudiation paper,

532
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,480
we also prepared a small ceremony for you two.

533
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,200
A ceremony?

534
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
The two of us

535
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,639
wish to witness your martial art prowess.

536
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,239
So this time tomorrow

537
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,399
Feng Yang can come here

538
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,279
to test her skills

539
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,879
against Yun Xiu's martial arts.

540
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:57,600
Yes!

541
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,720
That's what I meant.

542
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,720
- Maybe...
- Are we...

543
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,159
We should wait for a while.

544
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:21,759
I don't want anyone

545
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,320
to interrupt us.

546
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:26,879
I'm surprised Yun Xiu

547
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,440
is so talented.

548
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,999
He's a fast learner.

549
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:31,999
After you passed out,

550
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,679
Yun Xiu and Feng Yang

551
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:35,600
helped me carry you here.

552
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:38,519
What happened after I passed out?

553
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:39,759
Why would Xiao Zhen

554
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,840
let us go so easily?

555
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,519
You shielded me with your body

556
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,959
and got hit by the spirit energy.

557
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,279
But the Soul-guarding Bead

558
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,679
stopped attacking at that moment.

559
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,519
The mark of the backfire Her Majesty
had also disappeared.

560
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,160
Xiao Zhen realized he was wrong.

561
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
That's how all of us

562
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,679
managed to get away unscathed.

563
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:58,080
But one thing still baffles me.

564
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,439
Why would your sacrifice

565
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,840
make the Soul-guarding Bead

566
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,320
spare us?

567
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,360
It didn't stop because of me.

568
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,080
It was because of you.

569
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,279
Me?

570
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,840
In the most critical moment,

571
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,519
you hugged me from behind.

572
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:17,800
So the bead's spirit energy

573
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,479
attacked both of us.

574
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:20,800
And because

575
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,039
you share a special bond with
the Soul-guarding Bead,

576
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,880
it stopped attacking.

577
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,800
In other words,

578
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,679
your love for me

579
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,999
saved us all.

580
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,039
However,

581
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,039
do not

582
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,560
be so reckless again.

583
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,400
In worst cases,

584
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,999
we need someone

585
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,959
to look after Yu Er.

586
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,719
I told you

587
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,800
the exact same words at the Altar of Souls.

588
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,320
How dare you use my lines against me.

589
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,640
But judging by the situation,

590
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,640
Her Majesty

591
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,320
is the host of Soul-guarding Bead

592
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,160
in this world.

593
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,920
And it's likely that

594
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:00,640
she also possesses

595
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,519
the Soul-parting Xiao.

596
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,519
The power of the Soul-guarding Bead alone

597
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,279
might not be enough to bring us home.

598
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,160
There must be other requirements to meet.

599
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,160
But what

600
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,640
requirements do we need to meet?

601
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,239
I think Her Majesty and Xiao Zhen

602
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,519
must know some secrets.

603
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,880
If Xiao Zhen can sense

604
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
the anomaly of the Soul-guarding Bead too,

605
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,600
or perhaps he might have a certain
amount of control over it,

606
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,800
the answer we seek is likely in his

607
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
and Her Majesty's hands.

608
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,959
So we must search deeper

609
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,519
for a way to return to our world.

610
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,959
However,

611
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,719
it's best to be cautious.

612
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,920
I think Her Majesty

613
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:34,320
is keeping

614
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,160
some unspeakable plan.

615
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,560
I used to think babysitting a kid was tiring.

616
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,719
I even complained about it to you.

617
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,080
But it's been six months.

618
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,719
I really miss him.

619
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,719
Believe me.

620
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,239
We will find a way home.

621
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,640
My actions

622
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,279
had put you in harm's way.

623
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,080
If I could,

624
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,999
I would share your pain.

625
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,039
I was out of line.

626
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,239
Your Majesty.

627
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,160
Why am I here?

628
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,080
I deserve the worst of punishments.

629
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:30,719
Please punish me.

630
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:39,640
You were hurt because of me.

631
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,279
I'm fine.

632
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,400
Please don't be concerned.

633
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,800
It's fine.

634
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,199
Later

635
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,439
I'll order the imperial physician to
prescribe the best medicine.

636
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,279
Get well soon.

637
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,719
I will forever be in Your Majesty's debt.

638
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,719
After the ritual backfired,

639
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,560
you asked Second Princess to come?

640
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,279
My apologies.

641
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,600
After I found out

642
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,959
the Soul-guarding Bead resonated
with Her Highness,

643
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,800
I've been suspecting her identity.

644
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,400
So I took it upon myself

645
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,400
to force Her Highness to cooperate with me

646
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,920
in using the energy of the Soul-guarding Bead

647
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,959
to wake you up.

648
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,999
But in the end,

649
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,600
I lost control of its energy.

650
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,800
If Mo Lian Cheng did not come to save us in time,

651
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
I'm afraid...

652
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,439
I would never be able to atone for my mistake.

653
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,959
Mo Lian Cheng saved me?

654
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,080
He had two followers.

655
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,320
Yun Xiu and Mo Feng Yang.

656
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,439
Although they don't know

657
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,560
the true nature of the Soul-guarding Bead,

658
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:50,360
I knew I had made a grave mistake.

659
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,439
It seems like...

660
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,080
it wasn't me that he saved.

661
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,120
It was Second Princess.

662
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,519
Your Majesty.

663
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,400
You're still recovering.

664
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:05,880
Please stay calm.

665
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,239
You did well...

666
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,039
for this matter.

667
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,080
Had it not happened,

668
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,519
I would still have false hope

669
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,400
for a lost cause.

670
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,039
And now,

671
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,600
I realized...

672
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,759
I can't be a sitting duck.

673
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,999
I must...

674
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,160
make haste with my plan.

675
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,640
Qu Tan Er...

676
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,959
will be sacrificed for the greater good after all.
