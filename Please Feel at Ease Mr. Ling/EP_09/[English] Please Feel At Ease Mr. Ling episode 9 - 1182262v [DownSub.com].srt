21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,170
I've prepared a gift for you. It represents my kind regards.

22
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,530
President Ling, giving a good review doesn't mean that we can be good friends.

23
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,300
You understand that, right?

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm just giving you a gift to express my apologies.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,500
If you don't want it then throw it out.

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,730
Sorry, it wasn't on—

27
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,080
My heart is going to burst.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,780
I'm going to puke. You're disgusting.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,560
Let go of her.

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,700
Brother.

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,490
Does it hurt here? Is it here?

32
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,080
- Wait, wait.
- Does it still hurt?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait-

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,590
No, it doesn't hurt.

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Then I'll be leaving.

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,760
What?

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,020
Why are you so close to my big brother?

38
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,120
How am I close to him?

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,130
You even stroked his chest in front of my eyes.

40
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,750
Stroked his chest? I only touched it.

41
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,540
Why do I sound like a pervert from your mouth?

42
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,560
You haven't even stroked—

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,920
In short, don't have contact with him. Otherwise he will stick to you like a fly.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,530
Didn't you say you liked flies?

45
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,560
When did I—

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,550
He's your big brother.

47
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,470
How can you say that about your own brother?

48
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,450
If he's a fly then you're a little fly.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,570
Why are you always speaking for him?

50
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,490
- Do you care for him?
- I'm not speaking for him.

51
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm just saying the truth.

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,660
- Don't bring him up again.
- You were the one who brought him up.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,930
Are you jealous?

54
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,280
- No. 
- That's good then.

55
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,050
If you're not then we're just talking. Right?

56
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,040
I think Ling Fang isn't that bad as a person.

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,760
But, he's pretty cute.

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,480
If there's nothing else then I'll head back.

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,210
You can't.

60
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,740
Can't you move in with me?

61
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,730
Why would a man and woman live alone together?

62
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,900
- Is Gu Ansheng not a man?
- He's my brother.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,760
You and I just have a creditor and debtee relationship.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,080
You're my creditor. Plus, I already owe you a lot of money.

65
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,150
I don't want to owe you even more.

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,150
- You're allowed to not pay it back.
- No, I have to.

67
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,430
I can't always owe you.

68
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,090
- But isn't having a fate that lasts a lifetime a good thing?
- That's not necessary.

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm leaving.

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,500
<i>President Ling, how much was the car fare? I'll transfer it to you.<i></i></i>

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,260
<i>Talking about money hurts relationships.<i></i></i>

72
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,240
<i>Talking about relationships also hurts money. I only carpooled with you.</i>

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,340
<i> I still have to pay. </i>

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,820
<i>Cheesy.</i>

75
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,850
Brother Yue.

76
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,580
Miss Gu.

77
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,410
I didn't think you would be here too.

78
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,560
I have saw their advertisement and saw that the design was good so I came to take a look.

79
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,670
You probably understand lipsticks well.

80
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,870
Since your girlfriend likes to use it.

81
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,680
Girlfriend?

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,860
My sister Gu Anxin.

83
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,880
-Last time at the party- 
-She's not my girlfriend.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,490
Really?

85
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,460
I am still pursuing her. She hasn't agreeded yet.

86
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,610
Oh, then you should work a bit harder.

87
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,840
It sure is hard.

88
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,430
What kind of gifts do girls like?

89
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,640
To me as long as it's from someone that I like,

90
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,500
I would like it no matter what.

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
But, girl's

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,490
usually like a special perfume.

93
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,880
Ai Li, what kind of perfume do you use?

94
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Gu Long Perfume.

95
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,190
Can't really use that as reference.

96
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,840
Apologizes.

97
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,400
Anxin is cheerful.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,650
A heavier perfume scent probably doesn't suit her.

99
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,860
She is more suited with a sweet fruit scent.

100
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,040
Miss Gu seems to know perfumes well.

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,230
It's nothing, I just know Anxin well.

102
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,510
Especially since she's my sister.

103
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,070
Do you need any suggestions?

104
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,680
-Please do. 
-No worries.

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,250

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,290
Don't be too nervous about meeting your coworkers.

108
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,220
Hi, Chief Inspector.

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,690
Anxin, from today on you are a formal editor of Zhao Shi Culture.

110
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm your group leader.

111
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,320
-Manager Zhao.
-No need to be so polite.

112
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Here we are. If you need anything come and find me.

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,600
If you want to get food then don't look for me.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,830
-I have a lot to do everyday and am quite busy after all.
-Ok, Manager Zhao.

115
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,730
You can look for Xiao Zhang or Xiao Wang too. It's all the same.

116
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,000
-Then I'm going to go back to work. 
-Okay.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,940
Here is your seat.

118
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,570

Hello! I'm He Shuhuan.

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,350
<i>This is a new comedy routine?</i>

123
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,020
Hello! I'm Lu Yiping.

124
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,710
Anxin, you are so funny.

125
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,390
-Isn't she, Huan Huan?
-You're right.

126
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,560
But you aren't laughing.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,420
I've laughed haven't I?

128
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,570
W-What are you guys laughing about?

129
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,310
Her He Shuhuan's He, Shu Qi's Shu and Zhen Huan's Huan.*(The characters of her name are taken from well-known drama character's names)

130
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,720
It's not from Romance in the Rain.*(Famous chinese drama)

131
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm so sorry. I thought-

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,640
-I'm sorry.
-It's alright!

133
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,050
She's just like that. Even though she doesn't look it,

134
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,040
she's actually super happy inside.

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,830
After all, our studio

136
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,840
is missing young, beautiful women.

137
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,850
How? Everyone's young and beautiful!

138
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,320
In the future, everyone will be working together.

139
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,210
If you don't understand something, feel free to ask!

140
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,020
-I'll take care of you!
-Ok!

141
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,740
Thank you！

142
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,370
Didn't the internet say it's impossible to get in line? Why is there no one here?

143
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,680
Let me tell you. All the stuff on the net are fake.

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,810
Not necessarily. What if it's because it's not lunch time yet?

145
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,760
Who knows? We're celebrating Anxin's start at a new company today!

146
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Thank you.

147
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,370
Hey what-what is this?

148
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,320
Scared me!

149
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,740
Thank you...

150
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,750
Brother, we didn't order hotpot and this stuff right?

151
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,520
We didn't...

152
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,880
I'm sorry. We didn't order red wine and...these

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,800
These are all gifts from our store's VIP, Mr.Ling.

154
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,210
-Mr.Ling?
-It couldn't be Xiao Ba?

155
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,490
He wouldn't do something so exaggerated, right?

156
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,120
I've reserved this entire place!

157
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm the one who ordered the meat and wine. If it's not enough, there's more!

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,430
Call for anything you want to eat. Order anything and don't hold back.

159
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,450
How is it?

160
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,260
Are you moved?

161
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,770
Afraid to move.

162
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,040
Then I'll move more.

163
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm sorry. I have to drive in a bit, and my sister doesn't drink.

164
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,480
We accept your kindness.

165
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,770
That's unfortunate. It's Lafite from '82.

166
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,510
Who's this Mr.Ling? He does some cheesy things, but looks quite good.

167
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,980
It's the cheesy rich man I told you about before.

168
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,330
He looks quite good. What a waste of his good looks.

169
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,410
-He looks good?
-It's alright.

170
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,660
I can hear your little whispers.

171
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,040
So what if you hear?

172
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,060
This meal

173
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,240
isn't tasty all of a sudden.

174
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,130
Big brother, this air conditioner's leaking water.

175
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,590
It's just because you're my little brother.

176
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,480
I go easy on you.

177
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,780
Let's all eat first.

178
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,540
Eat!

179
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,660
What horrible pot is this? It burns the meat.

180
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,690
Can it be anything other than burnt the way you're doing it?

181
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,630
You do it then!

182
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,140
Who knew you actually know how to do things.

183
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,480
Because I have a good teacher.

184
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,950
This is called...the disciple is better than the master.

185
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,740
Did you get burned?

186
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,770
I told you to be careful! Where?

187
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,380
I'm alright.

188
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,940
Brother, I'll go buy some medicine. I'll be back soon.

189
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,510
Wait here.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Anxin, let's go together.

191
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,510
How disgusting.

192
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,570
What are you doing? Aren't we going to buy medicine?

193
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,460
Ling Yue, I'm talking to you. Hey-hey!

194
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,880
Those annoying people aren't here anymore.

195
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,920
I can finally do what I want boldly.

196
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,130
Do? D-Do what?

197
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,480
Help me apply medication.

198
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,750
If you had medicine in your car, you should've said so earlier. What a waste of time.

199
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,200
Then if I told you earlier, would you have come down with me?

200
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,020
So you did it on purpose?

201
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,040
Isn't that because of you? Always pushing me away.

202
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,910
If you're putting it like that, then it's my fault.

203
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,520
No. It's my fault.

204
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,770
Anxin, forgive me.

205
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,050
No matter what happens, I won't leave you again.

206
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,390
I can forgive you.

207
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,000
However...

208
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,660
I promise you my everything.

209
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,150
I-I wasn't talking about that.

210
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,460
What do you want to say?

211
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,310
I was saying...

212
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,620
Have you forgiven me?

213
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,220
Alright, I give up! You're too good, alright?

214
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Then come with me tomorrow to meet my family.

215
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,750
Meet your parents?

216
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,950
This fast?

217
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,380
I-I haven't agreed to be your girlfriend.

218
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,210
-Then aren't you right now?
-I'm not!

219
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,830
I just agreed to forgive you, but I didn't agree to be your girlfriend.

220
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,260
Then if you aren't willing, then forget it!

221
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,740
What do you mean forget it? You're regretting it already?

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,360
Then you're truly my girlfriend.

223
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,990
It's not too much to eat a meal together, right?

224
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,500
It's fine.

225
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,720
Then where are we going?

226
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,800
We're switching places to eat barbeque.

227
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,140
Then I have to tell my brother and You You.

228
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,210
Send a message.

229
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,120
Why hasn't Anxin come back? Taking so long just to buy medicine.

230
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,910
Alright!

231
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,680
You two continue eating. I don't think those two will be coming back.

232
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,250
You're leaving?

233
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,890
I still have business and will be leaving. Hey!

234
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,290
The meat's burnt. Hurry up you two.

235
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,930
It's fine though?

236
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,390
<i>Brother, I'll be leaving first. You have to send You You back home safely.</i>

237
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,420
<i>Come home early.</i>

238
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,670
<i>My beloved concubine, I will be leaving first.</i>

239
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,590
<i>Make sure to take advantage of your alone time with my brother!</i>

240
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,860
<i>Understood! I will try my best to give you a nephew soon.</i>

241
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,100
Ansheng, try this.

242
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,300
-It's delicious.
-Thank you.

243
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,850
Don't drink red wine. If you're eating barbeque, you have to drink spirit.

244
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,850
We aren't leaving sober. Waiter! Give us a bottle of spirit!

245
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,860
Toast?

246
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,790
You You?

247
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,210
Are you...ok?

248
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm alright...

249
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,970
Why...am I a little dizzy?

250
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,550
Can you...send me back in a bit?

251
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,470
Ok...

252
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,380
You You.

253
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,570
Here, I'll go drive the car over.

254
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,690
Wait for me here. Are you ok by yourself?

255
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,640
Don't worry. Go drive the car.

256
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,920
I'll wait for you here...

257
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,060
Ok, I'll be quick.

258
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,570
Why did you push me?

259
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,620
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

260
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,690
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

261
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,130
I think you did it on purpose.

262
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,870
Elder sister, who would take advantage of you?

263
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,920
Elder sister?

264
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,220
Who are you calling elder sister?

265
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,740
Are you blind?

266
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,550
-You're the elder sister! You're whole family's an elder sister!
-I didn't mean it like that-

267
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,050
I'm sorry! I didn't-

268
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,630
Wait, don't hit me!

269
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,560
-How could you call me elder sister?
-Don't hit me!

270
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,460
-What's wrong? What's wrong?
-Ansheng...

271
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,800
He bullied me.

272
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,930
-Who's bullying who here?
-You're bullying me!

273
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,660
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. My friend drank too much.

274
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,350
Uh...should I take you to the hospital?

275
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,020
-No need!
-No need. No need.

276
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,140
Hurry and take her back. Stop making trouble outside!

277
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,910
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
-Don't let me see you again!

278
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,620
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

279
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,370
You You.

280
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,100
Let's go home, alright? I'll send you back.

281
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,630
I'm tired. I want to rest for awhile.

282
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,480
I'll take you to the car.

283
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,380
Why don't you have battery?

284
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,420
Don't be in a hurry. I'll charge you up, alright?

285
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,910
You You, there's no where to charge your phone here. We can in my car.

286
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,730
Let's go to my car.

287
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,310
There is. How is there not?

288
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,640
Don't worry. It doesn't matter where we charge it.

289
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,470
See.

290
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
You You.

291
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,430
It's about to rain. Let me take you back to the car.

292
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,160
Alright?

293
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,090
You keep trying to make me go to your car.

294
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,640
Do you want to do some embarrassing things to me?

295
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,320
No, no. You've misunderstood. I don't mean it like that.

296
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,430
It's alright.

297
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,130
I-I've always wanted to give birth to

298
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,460
little monkeys for you.

299
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,810
Perfume?

300
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,070
<i>Wow, who knew you were into perfume?</i>

301
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,450
<i>Does that give me some points?</i>

302
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,920
<i>Keep trying!</i>

303
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,470
<i>Oh, right. I'm downstairs. We can leave now.</i>

304
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,240
<i>Alright, I'll be down after changing.</i>

305
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,490
Wait. Something's missing.

306
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,250
Don't worry. I'm here.

307
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,600
Is that a family portrait? Which one of them is you?

308
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,810
I really don't know you well enough. You like him instead of me.

309
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,020
Why is there a fly in your house?

310
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,610
Why are you here?

311
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,250
You two are really...

312
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Mom.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,920
- This is Anxin. 
 - You're Anxin?

314
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,620
Come sit down.

315
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,150
Sorry, Auntie. There was some traffic on the way here.

316
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,180
It's fine. It's good that you're here.

317
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,880
Brother, the two of you planned to come together?

318
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,510
Future sister in law, I've finally met you.

319
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,160
Hello.

320
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,210
You guys are finally here.

321
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,780
-Hello Auntie. 
-Hello.

322
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,950
She played the piano well today.

323
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,860
When Anxin was in college, she was a lot better than me at playing piano.

324
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,430
-Anxin also graduated from Yale University right?
-Auntie, you might not know

325
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,570
Before I studied overseas, I studied my undergraduate degree at Seijoh University.

326
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,180
Anxin was my classmate in my undergraduate course.

327
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,060
That's not right.

328
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,880
If I remember correctly, Anxin didn't graduate from university.

329
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,930
Brother.

330
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,510
Brother Ling Fang, you can't say it like that.

331
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,520
-Anxin is actually—

332
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,440
It's true that I'm not university graduate.

333
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,190
However, President Ling Fang.

334
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,360
At least I know how to respect people. Unlike you

335
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,290
who graduated from college and still didn't learn how to. It's a pity.

336
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,460
Anxin, Brother Ling Fang didn't have any bad intentions.

337
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,680
-There's no need to be so nitpicky.
-That's right.

338
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,730
If you want the listener to think that way, the speaker must have the right intentions.

339
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,480
Right?

340
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,740
Mom.

341
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,330
Mom. Just listen.

342
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,630
I knew it. Anxin has such a bad temper, I don't know if Brother will be able to handle it.

343
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,740
-Alright, alright, don't say too much.
-Coincidently

344
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,180
I like her bad temper.

345
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,940
Listen to that.

346
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,340
What are you all talking about?

347
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,600
You guys are having a good time talking.

348
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,020
-Dad.
-Hello, Uncle.

349
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,660
Dad.

350
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,080
Dad.

351
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,690
Hello, Uncle.

352
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,040
Hello, Anxin.

353
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,520
You look exactly like your mom.

354
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,930
Sit.

355
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,900
Uncle.

356
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,150
It's our first time meeting, so I brought you a small gift.

357
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,890
You are such a thoughtful child.

358
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,940
- What is it? 
 - Open it and take a look.

359
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,680
A brush.

360
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,890
How valuable.

361
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,600
Uncle. This was my mom's favorite calligraphy brush.

362
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,840
I brought it to gift it to you for remembrance.

363
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,660
Thank you.

364
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,730
Speaking of gifts, I also prepared a small gift for Uncle.

365
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,830
Xin'er is so thoughtful.

366
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,550
Miss Gu always impresses.

367
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,220
I accidentally stumbled upon this piece of artwork from the Baroque period.

368
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,740
Since Uncle likes it, I'm glad it found it's owner.

369
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,450
Anxin, is there something you want to say?

370
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,550
This painting is not from the Baroque period.

371
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,340
But from the Late Renaissance period.

372
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,070
It's also known as the Mannerism period.

373
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,320
Like it's name, it likes the form it takes.

374
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,420
This painting is exciting and strange.

375
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,540
It's also hard to understand what it expresses.

376
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,620
These are all aspects expressed during the Mannerism period.

377
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,920
What you said is true. As expected from the daughter of Xiao Wan.

378
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,990
Alright, put this painting up in the bathroom upstairs.

379
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,040
Aren't you deliberately embarrassing her?

380
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,790
It was intentional.

381
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,220
You sure do hold grudges.

382
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,440
So don't provoke me in the future.

383
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,110
Dad.

384
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,910
Out of these two presents, which one do you like more?

385
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,530
Brother, don't try to start anything.

386
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,210
Anxin,

387
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,340
ever since your mom gave birth to you, I never received

388
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,970
any news about you and your mother.

389
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,140
How have the two of you lived these past years?

390
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,930
Why did your mom suddenly-

391
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,460
Sorry, Uncle.

392
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,210
After my mom passed away, I fell ill.

393
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,330
There was a lot I couldn't remember after I woke up.

394
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,640
Child.

395
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,310
You have suffered so much.

396
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm your mother's best friend. If you are willing to,

397
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,470
I hope you can feel like Uncle Ling

398
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,090
is a family member of yours.

399
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,880
Thank you, Uncle.

400
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,550
I also have a gift I want to give you.

401
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,190
Open it and take a look.

402
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,780
Uncle.

403
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,740
I can't accept this gift.

404
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,380
You haven't even looked at it. How do you know if you can accept it or not?

405
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,290
You were close friends with my mom.

406
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,020
I'm sure that when my mom helped you, she wasn't expecting to get anything in return,

407
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,500
so I can't accept this valuable gift.

408
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,030
You might already know what the gift is.

409
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,920
Anxin, I respect your decision.

410
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,770
If you change your mind, you can always come find me.

411
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,240
You should know that Uncle Ling is also your family member.

412
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,790
The Ling family will always welcome you. Okay?

413
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,170
Okay.

414
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,050
Everyone is hungry right? Let's eat.

415
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,430
Eat. Eat. Eat.

416
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,680
Let's eat.

417
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,610
Here. Eat some fish.

418
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,540
He's allergic to parsley.

419
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,790
Look at how forgetful I am. Xin'er is so thoughtful.

420
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,750
That's to be expected. They were so close in high school.

421
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,810
You could say they were childhood sweethearts.

422
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,900
And, a match perfect looks wise.

423
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,480
The two of you know each other?

424
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,890
We were in the same school.

425
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,390
Here.

426
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,970
Second brother, if I'm not mistaken. Is your watch and Anxin's watch

427
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,010
a customized couple model?

428
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,750
That's right.

429
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,290
Dad. It's looks like you will be seeing Sister Anxin often.

430
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,720
Ling Yue, you must treat Anxin well.

431
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,200
If she's mistreated, I won't forgive you.

432
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,830
Dad, don't worry.

433
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,830
Anxin, eat.

434
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,350
Okay.

435
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,550
I picked out the parsley for you.

436
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,740
Ever since my second brother came back, you have never stopped looking at him.

437
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,970
I know. The only reason why you promised me to come back to eat,

438
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,190
was because you knew he would be here.

439
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,080
Since you know, why did you still bring me back?

440
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Because this is the first time you said yes to my invitation.

441
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,420
Even if it is because of my brother, at least it is a good start.

442
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,520
My feelings for him won't change that easily.

443
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,820
I know. But that's okay.

444
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,370
Don't forget, you still owe me a date.

445
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,110
It's up to you.

446
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,840
Where are we going?

447
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,410
Hey!

448
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,820
I wish you guys a wonderful night.

449
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,820
Have fun.

450
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,820
Are they?

451
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,300
President Ling.

452
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,220
-Ai Li! 
-Hi

453
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,380
Director Ling Fang...he...

454
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,280
It's going to rain, let me take you back.

455
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,430
Are you teasing a kid? You're telling me it's going to rain when the weather is so nice.

456
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:34,310
Can it be that you prepared a surprise for me?

457
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,830
No, I really didn't!

458
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,990
I really didn't.

459
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,360
It's really going to rain. Let's go.

460
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,850
Okay. Let's go.

461
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,590
I finally understand why you hate your brother.

462
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,150
He doesn't use money as it should be. All he knows is how to make trouble.

463
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,470
I originally wanted to give you a surprise.

464
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,350
I understand the effort!

465
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,200
Wait a second.

466
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,280
What is this?

467
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,050
Stupid, your face is dirty.

468
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,610
Anxin.

469
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,200
Let's restart?

470
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,670
Then you have to promise, you will tell me everything.

471
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,370
I promise you.

472
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,160
What are you doing now?

473
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,390
During the Gu company banquet, you owe me a dance.

474
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,730

Say yes!

482
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,480
Okay.

483
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,430

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:41,180
She...She is afraid that after she accepts my gift

489
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,330
it'll confirm the rumors between her mom and I.

490
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,590
This kid, is a good kid.

491
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,860
Xiao Wan would rest easy knowing this.

492
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,450
Boss, are we going to leave now? What about the shares?

493
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,970
What can we do? Didn't you see how those two were like Siamese twins?

494
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,530
Are you sure that Gu Anxin

495
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,060
is interested in him?

496
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,970
But that is not my goal.

497
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,910

♫ <i>The future gives us both courage</i> ♫

521
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:02,690
♫ <i>So don't suspect anymore, this must be love</i> ♫

522
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,510
♫ <i>It's love</i> ♫

523
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,220
What happened?

524
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,600
I bought this house back.

525
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,760
I'm this house's landlord now and you're the tenant.

526
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,320
However, the rent period is everlasting.

527
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,550
You're not joking?

528
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,170
This is our contract.

529
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,000
But I added a line behind it.

530
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,300
<i> I, Ling Yue </i>

531
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,260
<i>promise to rent the house, and will only rent it to Ms.Gu Anxin.</i>

532
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,260
<i>I will never raise rent nor sell the house.</i>

533
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,830
<i>If I ever go against the contract, it can be seen as purposefully relinquishing ownership on the house. </i>

534
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,390
<i>The house will belong to Ms.Anxin.</i>

535
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,770
This contract is too unfair for you, right?

536
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,360
No, I think it's quite fair.

537
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm the landlord. You need to pay me rent.

538
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,380
It's very equal. Just like this contract,

539
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,930
last time I took advantage of it. Now it's your turn.

540
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,230
Thank you.

541
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,260
This was where our relationship started, and now our relationship is continuing.

542
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,410
We will hug each other tightly and not let go anymore.

543
