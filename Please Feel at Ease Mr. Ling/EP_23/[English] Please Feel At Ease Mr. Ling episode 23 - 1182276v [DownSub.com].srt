22
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,990
Are you sure you didn't see them on the island?

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,920
We searched for a few days and found a suspicious couple. We followed them for a couple days and found out that it's not them.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,690
Boss, didn't Brother Lun burn them to death? What are you worried about?

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,280
Without seeing the corpse, my heart isn't at ease.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,300
It's been more than twenty years, so I understand Ling Yue too well.

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,940
Sinister, cunning

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,300
Just like the fish in the sea: slimy.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,230
If they are still alive, we won't be able to catch them even if we wanted to.

30
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,980
Sprinkle some bait to get a bite, right?

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,960
Understood, Boss. I will send more people to continue searching.

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,570
Dad, what are you looking at?

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,680
While I am still lucid,

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm looking through old photos.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,510
Combing through the things in the past.

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,070
Dad, it looks like Second Brother's weight in your heart is still heavier.

37
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,460
Nonsense.

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,120
You three are all my biological sons,

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,370
and you all have the same weight in my heart.

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,710
There was something I originally planned to tell you first.

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,080
Right now, just rest first.

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,270
I will go get your medicine.

<i>[The President of Ling Group Unexpectedly Dies, What Will be the Future of Ling Group?]</i>

44
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,280
Ling Sheng, what exactly is going on?

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,520
Dad, Second Brother had an accident.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,450
As for his funeral, I have already taken care of it.

47
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,600
I was afraid you would be upset, so I didn't dare to tell you.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,770
Don't blame me.

49
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,920
Doctor! Doctor come quickly, my dad fainted!

50
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm very sorry everyone.

51
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,210
My dad is still receiving emergency treatment in the intensive care unit. I'm not in the mood to be interviewed.

52
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,960
But everyone please be rest assured.

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,100
All the business of Ling Group will proceed as normal and will not be affected in any way.

54
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,090
Right now the most pressing matter is my dad's health.

55
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,240
I hope that my dad can smoothly get through this danger period.

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,150
But there have been rumors over the internet lately that  Ling Group's financial affairs have problems.

57
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,170
How do you explain this?

58
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,390
As they say, family disgraces shouldn't be spread publicly.

59
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,790
But according to the findings of our investigation,

60
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,570
this matter is directly related to New Way.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,690
So you're saying, Ling Group did indeed appear at the asset transfer situation

62
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,640
and it was the dead Ling Yue's doing.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,930
Don't speak ill of the deceased.

64
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,080
Even if my Second Brother has done some wrong things,

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,180
<i> I, Ling Sheng, am here to implore everyone </i>

66
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,320
<i> don't mention it again. </i>

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,560
<i> Thanks, everyone. </i>

68
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,220
This interview must be released on all internet, paper, and new media platforms.

69
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Understood, Director Sheng. I will do so immediately.

70
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,430
<i> Thanks, everyone. </i>

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,730
This Ling Sheng really is shameless.

72
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,710
Exploiting you and your dad's father-son relationship and even slandering you.

73
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,310
Does he really think that we're dead and won't tear off his mouth?

74
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,530
But we don't have any evidence to prove that he is lying.

75
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,250
And with my dad's current situation,

76
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,540
I'm worried that Ling Sheng will do more excessive things.

77
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,680
But this is obviously something he designed.

78
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,260
If we hastily appear, wouldn't it be falling into his trap?

79
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,240
No matter what, I have to return.

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,430
I will go look at my dad's situation.

81
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,470
If my dad is also under his control,

82
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,820
the situation will be more troublesome than it is now.

83
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,150
Ok, I will go back with you.

84
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,160
Stay here. After I take care of these things, I will come back for you.

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,130
Didn't we say that we do things together?

86
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
Let me go with you.

87
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,500
Fine

88
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,680
Rest assured, I will protect you well.

89
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,060
It's better if I protect you.

90
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,370
Dad . . . look at me

91
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,270
Why . . . why why

92
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,640
Sorry for scaring you.

93
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,960
Has it been too strenuous recently?

94
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,460
Just now you were continuously sleep talking.

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,460
What did I say?

96
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,490
You're probably too worried about Uncle.

97
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,960
Uncle has the best medical treatments right now. He will definitely recover.

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,110
Xin'er, I'm scared.

99
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,110
I had a dream.

100
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,380
So many things happened in the dream.

101
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,660
I am really scared that the dream will become reality.

102
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,500
In the dream,

103
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,430
I remember that no matter how I waited for you,

104
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,560
but you didn't come at all.

105
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,320
When I wanted to give up, you finally came.

106
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,290
But you stood in front of me and said

107
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,970
"Ling Sheng, how could I like you?"

108
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,130
Silly fool

109
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,010
Xin'er, I'm scared.

110
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,530
I'm really very scared.

111
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,680
I really am scared that you will leave me.

112
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,770
I won't, I won't.

113
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,840
From now on,

114
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,510
you won't be alone again.

115
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,300
<i>[Really?]</i>

116
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,420
We finally meet.

117
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,060
What do you think? The movie theater I found is well hidden.

118
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,810
-Very well done, love you. 
 -As you should.

119
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,380
President Xiao Ling, your family really is a mountain of swords and a sea of flames.

120
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,520
Your own brother is really going to die.

121
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,120
That person does things to the extreme.

122
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,490
But since we don't have evidence, we must be passive.

123
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,210
The purpose of returning. First, is I'm worried about my dad's safety. Second, is to gather evidence.

124
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,770
Only by gathering sufficient evidence, can I confront him head-on.

125
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,250
How can you gather evidence? You can't enter the company or return home right now.

126
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,730
This requires you two, Conan fans.

127
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,400
-Us two? 
 -Yes.

128
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,220
All my people are closely followed by Ling Sheng.

129
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,190
You two usually have little contact with me, so it won't raise suspicion.

130
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,890
Understood. Zero suspicion.

131
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,550
At that time you pretended to be my boyfriend and helped me dodge a bullet.

132
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,460
It's time for female warrior to repay the favor.

133
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,460
It's not important, now we have the real deal.

134
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,640
I don't want you to be the female warrior, I want you to be the detective.

135
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,510
In this suspense, no one can play the detectives but us.

136
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,430
Unraveling the truth, just the thought makes people excited.

137
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,330
Have a drink. I want an orange tea cooler.

138
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,720
-Are they reliable? 
 -One hundred percent reliable.

139
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,290
What should we do next?

140
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,370
Ling Sheng and Yang Hong's interests are deeply intertwined. It will be very hard to discover their crack.

141
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,620
First of all, we have to create enmity between them.

142
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,280
Firstly, I can gather evidence.

143
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,270
Secondly, I can enter Ling Group to check Ling Sheng's account.

144
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,860
Right now he wants to control more shares, so he will definitely go to Yang Hong for help.

145
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,600
He wants Yang Hong's money, so he will definitely bring Gu Xin'er's marriage into discussion.

146
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,830
Merging their businesses through marriage.

147
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,030
Then how can we know about their progress?

148
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,970
Rest assured, I still have a hidden bargaining chip.

149
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,650
Director Sheng.

150
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,030
Why is it you?

151
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,810
Fang Xue, why are you here?

152
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,770
I come to this bar often.

153
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,500
Director Sheng, congratulations. You are now the head of Ling Group.

154
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,800
It's too early to say that, I haven't officially taken office.

155
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,840
Sooner or later Ling Group will be yours.

156
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,050
Thanks for your continuous care, Xiao Xue drinks to you.

157
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,660
Our cooperation has constantly been pleasant. No need to be so polite.

158
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,180
Director Sheng, our contract will expire soon.

159
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,470
Should we still renew it?

160
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,610
Of course. Provided that you have the desire to, we can renew it at any time.

161
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,550
That's great, Director Sheng! Then we can talk about the renewal matters.

162
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,260
Sorry, I am a little busy.

163
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,140
We can talk about the renewal matters later.

164
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,980
Xuer that was beautiful the show was spectacular

165
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,700
of course I can't forget about you

166
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,550
happy to cooperate

167
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,140
we must lower his status

168
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,300
can't believe he would do this

169
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,610
Is this the good news you give me?

170
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,670
they can't go missing, I will give you an explanation the by today

171
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,670
you better explain it well

172
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,230
'hospital'

173
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,280
In the name of protection, keep your family's old man captive here.

174
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,940
his heart is so cruel

175
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,110
I didn't think he wouldn't even let go Ling father

176
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,580
Lingsheng is already off the rails

177
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,880
but rest assured we are all watching him

178
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,060
he knows whats happening

179
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,890
Aili and I will do our best

180
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,750
Hello?

181
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,150
Yanghong is at the plaza

182
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,850
are you guys prepared

183
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,420
ready

184
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,450
we will stay in contact

185
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,780
this is my recorder

186
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,090
Zhaolei put it in Yaohong's purse

187
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,960
Alright

188
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,720
Hello miss! Welcome to our store event

189
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,660
excuse me, I'm in a rush

190
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,730
Miss Yang?

191
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,450
the honorable Miss Yang, thank you for the support of our humble shop

192
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,050
today we give you a special membership discount

193
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,430
how did you know my surname is Yang

194
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,190
Yanghong is super arrogant

195
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,450
If you flatter her she will give in

196
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,660
I've had the pleasure to serve you a few time

197
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,460
I couldn't forget such a stunning customer

198
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,900
and you are our VVVIP top three

199
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,580
Alright sure, why don't you share with me what promotion you have

200
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,390
of course

201
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,330
if it's Lingsheng, he would be extremely cautious to meet with Yanghong

202
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,010
then our recorder might get discovered

203
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,170
if it's Yanghong...

204
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,360
she is won't let her bag get checked

205
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,130
what do want?

206
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,100
Ma'am please cooperate

207
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,630
you think I don't trust you

208
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,430
It's fine

209
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,690
then get the recorder back

210
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,130
don't be too suspicious

211
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,850
everyday at 3pm she goes to LinMao restaurant to have afternoon tea, it's a perfect oportunity

212
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,680
Hello Miss

213
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,890
a latte and strawberry shortcake

214
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,400
yes

215
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,970
your taste is so great

216
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,360
this is... oh

217
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,400
what is wrong with you?

218
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,830
oh i'm so sorry

219
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,150
get a napkin

220
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,020
oh my gosh these pants must be expensive

221
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,300
i'm sorry miss

222
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,030
i won't be able to wash this off

223
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,610
Auntie Yang isn't it a vulnerable time to get caught

224
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,880
and scared about nothing

225
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,960
then we would still have to give them the opportunity to attack

226
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,010
Miss Yang do you believe these photos

227
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,990
If I didn't intercept these pictures

228
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,150
then it be posted everywhere

229
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,500
what do you think?

230
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,010
I have my limits

231
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,660
I would never hurt Xiner

232
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,820
Please believe me, mother

233
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,890
I can't accept such a promise

234
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,850
if it happened once then there will be a second

235
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,920
I can block it once but not forever

236
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,990
my patience is limited. hopefully you won't do anything like this again

237
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,250
please feel assured I only have eyes for Xiner

238
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,960
Our goal will quickly be accomplished

239
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,930
as long as you save me

240
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,390
it is saving Xiner and Gushi Company

241
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,630
I never knew before but...

242
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,040
all your words are flattery

243
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,230
as now we are on the same team

244
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,790
you are my mother and I am now your son

245
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,100
I will treat Xiner well and treat Ansheng as a brother

246
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,430
sweet words...

247
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,970
but you transferring the assets is illegal

248
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,070
if I am at risk

249
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,170
can you still keep the promise to Xiner

250
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,610
and place the promised equity under my name

251
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,610
I understand, what do you wish me to do?

252
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,600
sign an official transfer of equity

253
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,920
whats the matter? you are not willing?

254
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,660
of course

255
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,460
can you believe me now

256
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,420
did you take care of Anxin and Lingyue

257
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,270
relax

258
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,610
those two are now good as gone

259
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,050
<i> You're so sure. </i>

260
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,940
I couldn't even find them all the ICU's

261
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,010
I know him well, this is how he dies

262
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,890
as long as he is alive, he will even crawl to visit father, unless he is dead

263
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,810
then thats good

264
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,090
last time she brought up the past I think it would be bad for Xiner

265
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,140
I need her completely vanish then Xiner wouldn't be caught

266
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,370
this Yuguo is just so unlucky

267
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,320
the poison meant was for Anxin

268
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,110
if it wasn't because of her allergy...

269
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,750
don't worry it is all in the past

270
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,170
now I can give Yuguo an explanation

271
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,770
brother

272
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,020
Xiner, take a look

273
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,270
why did you buy this?

274
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,230
don't you like these

275
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,650
you always say I played favorites and only gave to Anxin

276
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,400
don't I know you?

277
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,190
you don't like sweets but you just wanted to eat with Anxin

278
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,430
you actually like walnut crepes

279
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,960
then why didn't you buy this sooner

280
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,970
hope it is not too late

281
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,870
thank you, brother

282
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,540
Xiner, I've been thinking

283
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,800
and couldn't figure it out

284
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,360
do you think living in reality is more important

285
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,390
or living happy more important

286
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,210
living in happiness

287
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,330
now if we have their signed contract and the recorder

288
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,240
then we can prove they transfered the equity

289
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,560
and not you

290
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,790
yes, thats true but we are running out of time

291
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,080
do as my brother says

292
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,720
him helping us is a little odd to me

293
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
don't have such prejudice against him

294
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,590
if he says he will help then he will do everything he can

295
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,600
your give him such high remarks

296
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,850
this isn't something to be jealous about

297
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,180
I am admiring him; he can inspire you to trust him so much.

298
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,510
Whenever we talk about him, you speak of him with so much pride.

299
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,030
Not so.

300
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,540
My adoration and trust in you is right in here.

301
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,960
It's packed full; I can't give it to anyone else.

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,390
Careful.

348
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,040
Mom.

349
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,600
Do me a favor and ask Xin'er why she's turned around and gone back?

350
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,780
She probably forgot something. She's forgetful.

351
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,120
We'll do this together.

352
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,380
How do you open this?

353
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,810
I've got the automation console now. I re-programmed the face recognition software.

354
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,200
I'll go keep watch.

355

357
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,490
Wait a minute.

358
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,170
- Mom, why did you get out? 
 - I'm going to use the bathroom.

359
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,220
Xin'er, have you gotten everything?

360
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,610
- Yes, I've got it. 
 - I'm going to use the bathroom.

361
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,290
Is something wrong, Xin'er?

362
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,530
Don't worry, Brother. It's fine.

363

<i> [Gu Xin'er and Ling Sheng] </i>

364
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,460
Lao Gu.

365
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,410
Congratulations on your son's engagement.

366
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,910
Engagement?

367
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,450
- Who's getting engaged? 
 - Hey, Lao Gu.

368
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,540
You really are a joker.

369
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,780
Lao Jiang.

370
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,220
Thank you for coming to this event. These days, many people don't show this kind of consideration.

371
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,690
Of course.

372
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,040
- Congratulations, congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

373
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,460
- I'm going to talk with a friend. 
 - Okay.

374
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,130
What's wrong, Yuanchao?

375
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,170
Is... is today Anxin's engagement party?

376
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,920
- It's Xin'er. 
 - Xin...Xin'er?

377
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,950
Who...who are you?

378
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,860
Let's get something to eat. Don't drink anymore.

379
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,490
I believe that, with all of your support, our Ling Shi Group will become better and better.

380
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,200
It surely will.

381
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,300
President Sheng, we'll take a look over there, okay?

382
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,580
- Okay. 
 - Excuse us.

383
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,420
Third Brother, here. Spare me a few minutes.

384
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,360
Brother, I'm busy. If you need something. we can talk about it later.

385
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,890
Then...let's have a drink.

386
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,310
Since this is a happy occasion, I'll have a drink with you.

387
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,920
Brother, let's talk later.

388
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,570
The banquet will start soon; I'll go get ready.

389
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,530
Get this printed. Then put it over there. Yes. That should work.

390
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,060
Heavens!

391
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,370
Where did you come from, waitress? Can't you carry water?

392
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,910
What's going on here?

393
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,440
What are you doing? You're so careless. You're so pretty; do you use that instead of brains?

394
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,940
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. There's nothing important on this computer, is there?

395
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,890
- This has all the videos we want to show. 
 - Aiya....this...

396
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,220
Fortunately, President Ling already prepared a back up.

397
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,380
Go back to work. Be more careful.

398
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm so sorry.

399
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,650
Come to my office this afternoon. I want to talk to you.

400
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,180
Okay.

401
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,280
It's like that. So, Miss Gu, we'll be going.

402
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,860
Thank you.

403
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,040
Our Xin'er is very beautiful today.

404
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,550
Brother.

405
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,000
Thank you, Brother.

406
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,330
But there are some other things that I want to talk to you about.

407
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,900
I saw Ling Yue and Anxin.

408
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,550
<i> This is your hone, too. Do you know where the back door is? </i>

409
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,490
What were you thinking?

410
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,280
They are okay so I'm at ease.

411
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,090
But what I thought before was that after this engagement is over,

412
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,510
everything will become easier.

413
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,480
Ling Yue and Anxin

414
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,770
would also come to congratulate us.

415
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,490
They.

416
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,720
Xin'er, are you ready? It's almost about to start.

417
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm ready.

418
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,980
Brother. I trust you.

419
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,710
No matter what happens, you will be by my side.

420
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,880
What are you guys talking about?

421
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,270
We are saying that in the future, if you dare bully me

422
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,010
my brother won't let you go.

423
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,210
Brother, relax. Leave Xi'an to me.

424
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,960
Let's go.

425
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,390
We are leaving, brother.

426
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,400
Everyone, thank you for coming to the engagement party for me and Xin'er

427
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,060
and sharing our happiness.

428
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,360
The way I see it, Xin'er

429
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,750
is like the moon in the skies.

430
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,130
Glorious. Bright and clear.

431
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,170
I've worked to get closer to her

432
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,380
for so many years.

433
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,880
Right now

434
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,830
I am finally next to her.

435
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,920
Holding her hand

436
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,830
Laughing together

437
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,610
Crying together, and becoming old together.

438
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,050
Thinking about this,

439
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,170
I think I'm the happiest man in the world

440
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,120
And I...

441
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,530
will giver her happiness.

442
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,840
Xin'er, thank you.

443
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,010
Thank you for coming to my side.

444
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,760
Stupid.

445
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,380
Why are you crying?

446
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,610
I prepared a surprise for you.

447
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,390
What?

448
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,840
<i> - Those are so nice. 
 - True. 
 - What's this then? </i>

449
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,910
<i> Your property transfer is illegal. </i>

450
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,760
<i>If I take the risk, you will be the biggest shareholder.</i>

451
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,920
<i>Will you still keep your promise</i>

452
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,820
<i>to list all the shares under my name?</i>

453
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,260
<i> - I understand. What do you want me to do? </i>

454
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,200
<i> Sign an official stock transfer document. </i>

455
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,460
<i> - What? 
 <i></i> - Let me through.  Excuse me. </i>

456
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,120
Mrs. Gu, is the voice in the video your voice? 
 - Give us an answer.

457
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,810
I really can't believe that Mrs. Gu is that kind of person.

458
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,030
<i> That's true. It's even more hard to believe about the young CEO Ling.  </i>

459
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,280
<i> How will you deal with Ling Yue and Anxin? </i>

460
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,350
<i> Don't worry. Those two are already wandering ghosts.  </i>

461
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,200
Soundman! Turn off the power! Turn it off.

462
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
<i> My father is already in intensive care. We don't have to rush him out. He may die. </i>

463
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,690
Xin'er, let me explain.

464
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,440
I can explain.

465
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,030
I don't know which statements you are saying are true.

466
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,250
Which ones are fake. Which ones are real?

467
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,520
I am true about you.

468
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,420
<i> -What's going on? Can you tell us what's going on. 
 - Mrs. Gu! Mrs. Gu! Give us an explanation. </i>

469
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,990
I originally believed that.

470
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,630
You know what the last part of that recording has.

471
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,400
If you love Xin'er, then you will let her leave with me immediately.

472
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,590
It's fine Xin'er. Let's go.

473
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,170
<i> - What's going on? Can you explain this to us? </i>

474
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,720
You're not allowed to take pictures!

475
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,850
Xin'er. I will explain to you when we get back, okay?

476
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,120
Xin'er. Listen to me. You have to leave here right now.

477
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,420
<i> - Yes. That's right. 
 - Mrs. Gu! Explain all this to us. </i>

478
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,560
<i> Before, that girl said there was new evidence. I'm really afraid it won't benefit Xin'er. </i>

479
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,060
<i> Only if she completely disappears, </i>

480
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,500
<i> our Xin'er the matter from before may be revealed. </i>

481
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,700
<i> That Yu Guo really is bad luck. </i>

482
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,940
<i>It's that darn girl with Alprazolam.</i>

483
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,660
<i> What is she drinking? </i>

484
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,400
<i> If you can't sleep again, you can't take this medicine carelessly. </i>

485
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,640
<i> Once or twice is okay. More than that, you can become dependent on it. </i>

486
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,440
<i> Don't worry. I'm just helping out a classmate. </i>

487
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,490
<i> She's been rehearsing lately and it's quite difficult. </i>

488
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,890
So she can't sleep.

489
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,200
Right, Xin'er.

490
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,590
<i> When will that play be performed? </i>

491
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,570
<i> My darling daughter surely has a leading role. </i>

492
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,600
<i> Even in my dreams, I wouldn't have believed  </i>

493
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,360
<i> that I'd be Gu Anxin's understudy.</i>

494
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,310
<i> I'm apologizing to you right now. </i>

495
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,470
<i> Ai! Yu Guo!</i>

496
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,750
Yu Guo!

497
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,500
Mom. Is this all true?

498
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,630
It's not real.

499
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,110
Xin'er, you've done nothing wrong.

500
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,930
It has nothing to do with you.

501
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,360
It was all An Xin's fault. All her fault.

502
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,370
Mom.

503
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,760
Baby. Mom is doing this for you.

504
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,920
It was all for you.

505
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,750
For me?

506
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,780
Did you do it for me or yourself?

507
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,460
You kept it secret from me for so many years.

508
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,720
It wasn't until today that I realized that I was the reason.

509
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,700
Now it's great.

510
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,720
I have nothing.

511
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,810
Are you satisfied?

512
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,250
Xin'er, calm down. Let's leave this place.

513
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,640
Is the recording real? Is this the reality of the situation?

514
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,610
Please explain. Did you hurt An Xin because of your own daughter?

515
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,290
Please say something.

516
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,720
<i> Give us a response. </i>

517
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,410
<i> Can you respond to our questions? </i>

518
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,320
Dad.

519
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,970
Send your dad to the hospital. I'm begging you. Son.

520
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,850
Someone come.

521
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,160
You two, stop the reporters.

522
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,660
No more pictures.

523
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,760
Hurry.

524
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,970
<i> Madam, madam, give us an answer. </i>

525
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,330
<i> Answer our questions, Madam. </i>

526
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,990
Xin'er.

527
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,330
<i> Just say a little something. Answer us, Miss Gu.  </i>

528
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,920
<i> Did you really harm someone? Exactly what went on back then? </i>

529
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,220
<i> Did you really do those things? </i>

530
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,340
<i> Everyone wants to know the truth, Miss Gu. </i>

531
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,190
<i> - Give us a response. 
 - Clarify this for us, okay? 
 - Don't leave.  </i>

532
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,720
<i> -What did that recording mean?  
 - Did you and your mother-in-law really transfer Ling Shi's property? </i>

533
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,870
<i> Is it true that you harmed your own brother because Miss Gu? </i>

534
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,750
<i> Please give us an explanation. Answer our questions in person here. </i>

535
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,860
Everyone, be quiet!

536
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,940
The recording is a fabrication.  It's all nonsense.

537
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,080
Are you still lying at this point of time?

538
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,120
<i>- You're still lying even now?
  - It's President Ling Yue. 
 - He's still alive? </i>

539
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,610
<i> This is great. This is going to be good. </i>

540
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,010
<i> True. The company will be saved. </i>

541
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,100
What is going on?

542
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,870
<i> How is it that he's here. Didn't he die? </i>

543
