22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,520
We're also searching for a camping spot!

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,790
Let's camp together?

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,300
So many?

25
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,320
Do you like it?

26
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,500
Why is my brother's car here?

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,120
He's asleep?

28
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,800
-Why are you here?
-Anxin...

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,720
You're saying that's the dude with amazing visuals?

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
That dude?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,110
A man like you can be called "that dude".

32
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,990
A man like...

33
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,850
Ansheng can't be referred to that way.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,430
He's not that handsome. Look at that facial hair.

35
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,340
Not as fine as me.

36
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm joking. I'm joking. Just saying it for fun.

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,310
-Why did you come here?
-What does it have to do with you?

38
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,240
Why are you here?

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,170
A single man is camping out my girlfriend's house.

40
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,160
How does that have nothing to do with me?

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,810
Also, this house is mine.

42
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,050
What's wrong with coming to check out my house?

43
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,980
Brother, why are you here?

44
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,550
-I...
-My brother came to pick me up!

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,610
I'm sorry. I had some business at home,

46
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,420
so I had my brother come pick me up.

47
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,540
You guys have fun. Let's hang out next time.

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,320
I'll be leaving first.

49
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,590
Let's go.

50
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,640
Brother...

51
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,650
You really waited for Anxin the whole night?

52
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,480
-I didn't.
-If you didn't,

53
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,360
then how could someone as clean as you,

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,880
not even shave?

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,600
I lost my razor.

56
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,770
What's wrong?

57
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,140
You really can't lie.

58
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,350
Why are you so stupid?

59
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,340
Suffering a whole night for Anxin.

60
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't want to talk about that right now.

61
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,510
Brother, we aren't kids anymore.

62
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,520
Anxin is also an adult now and doesn't need you to watch over her everyday.

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,140
Don't you think your kindness is already a bit over?

64
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,640
-It's not like a brother to a sister, but like-
-How is it not like a brother to a sister?

65
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,970
Am I not good to you?

66
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,420
It's not even close. Hurry and shave after going back.

67
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,640
Don't let mom see.

68
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,280
I know.

69
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,610
As a new person, you've already achieved such great results.

70
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,130
Did you foresee this beforehand?

71
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,780
Absolutely not.

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,620
Actually I only have a pure love for cartoons,

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,300
and simply drew the world I saw in my heart to share to my readers.

74
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,570
To receive so much attention and love, I actually...

75
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,890
feel quite overwhelmed and flattered.

76
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,040
You've been called the future of chinese cartoons.

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,900
The readers' expectations for you are much greater than before.

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,680
Would you have a lot of pressure?

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,170
Right now, compared to creating alone in the studio,

80
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,120
I definitely lack a lot of freedom.

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,050
There's definitely pressure as well.

82
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,850
But more importantly, I don't want to let down the people who like me.

83
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,640
I will try my best to turn pressure into motivation.

84
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,780
Alright. Then our interview

85
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,250
-will end here today. Thank you for your cooperation.
-Thank you.

86
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,380
Then I will look forward to a happy ending for "Accidentally Picking Up a Prince".

87
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,580
-I will keep reading.
-Thanks for the hard work.

88
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,220
Good luck.

89
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,630
Drive safely.

90
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,290
It's getting late. I'll be leaving first.

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,770
You've finally come back so stay for a few more days!

92
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,300
You've lost weight.

93
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,740
How can that be? I've gained weight.

94
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,320
Nonsense!

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,860
Wherever you gain weight on your body,

96
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,960
I can see it all clearly.

97
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,370
No, no, no. We must speed up

98
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,710
-finding a girlfriend for you.
-That's right!

99
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,160
I've never seen brother bring a girlfriend home.

100
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,840
Mom, don't worry about this matter.

101
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
What do you mean don't worry?

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,830
Look at your sister. Isn't she doing well with that Ling Sheng?

103
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,780
No, Mom! There's nothing between Ling Sheng and I.

104
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,170
-I just see him as a little brother.
-Arguing again.

105
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,100
Little brother? His eyes are almost grown on you!

106
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,010
You still deny it?

107
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,820
Oh, right! That Anxin and Ling Yue are pretty good as well.

108
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,420
Only you!

109
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,880
There's not even a hint of someone.

110
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,740
Do you have any friends that are possible?

111
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,580
Your Dad and I went from friends to husband and wife.

112
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,960
Mom, I'm really not interested in girls right now.

113
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,510
Not interested in girls?

114
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,200
You aren't...

115
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,620
No...

116
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,740
-What are you thinking?
-Then why aren't you looking for a girlfriend?

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,350
Aside from Anxin, I've never seen you be close with another girl!

118
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,240
You can't possibly date her right?

119
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,720
Mom! Brother's just returned from overseas. He still needs to adapt to life here.

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,550
Also girls from overseas and here act differently.

121
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,530
I know you are in a hurry for a grandson,

122
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,120
but you have to give him some time.

123
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Xin'er is right.

124
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,840
I don't care.

125
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,980
Your brother's dating life can't keep dragging on like this.

126
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm looking forward to being a grandma one day.

127
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,390
Last time, the Aunt Chen who did nails with me

128
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,450
has a daughter that also studied abroad like you.

129
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,050
She's really beautiful!

130
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,930
I have her picture on my phone. Do you want to see?

131
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,670
I really don't need to Mom.

132
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,230
Just stop rushing me, alright?

133
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,120
I don't care! You must find time to meet her.

134
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,790
Hello?

135
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,420
Youyou, I've planned a date for you.

136
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,220
You must go this time.

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,850
I don't want to go...

138
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,590
If you don't go, I'll end our mother and daughter relationship!

139
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,280
Mom!

140
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,280
Move, move, move.

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
Ever since my mom thought I broke up with Xiao Ba,

142
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,170
my phone's been ringing nonstop!

143
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,480
Anxin, can you do me another favor?

144
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,020
The one in gray sitting there.

145
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,960
That's him.

146
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,140
Youyou, he actually seems alright to me.

147
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,840
Why don't you go try it first?

148
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,750
What can you see from here?

149
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,010
Anyways, what age is it now to still have parent's decide your marriage?

150
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm telling you that I'm definitely not going.

151
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,970
Isn't everything still planned out clearly for you?

152
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,640
Or else you wouldn't have come to us for help.

153
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,300
Let me tell you. We'll proceed with the plan in a bit.

154
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,040
Once I walk over,

155
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,610
sit down, and pick up the water cup,

156
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,260
you guys will head out.

157
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,600
Ok. Don't worry, Youyou.

158
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,850
We'll definitely make him feel...

159
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,590
excited.

160
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,860
Ye!

161
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,560
I've come!

162
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,290
-Youyou?
-It‘s you?

163
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,010
You're Aunt Chen's daughter?

164
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,500
The young talent my mom was talking about is you?

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
<i>I, Youyou's, spring is here again! I love arranged meetings!</i>

166
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,280
Thank god it's you today, or else I wouldn't know what to do.

167
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,650
Then since we've already come, let's just continue with this arranged date.

168
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,310
What do you like to do normally?

169
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,860
Just photography, traveling, and cooking.

170
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,250
I also like photography!

171
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,230
Let me tell you, I normally take photos for-

172
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,060
Hurry and go!

173
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,220
Xu Youyou!

174
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,520
Didn't you say you were on a business trip?

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,320
You're going behind my back to go on a date with this wild man?

176
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,060
What do you take me for? A green turtle? You must give me an explanation today!

177
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,830
It's not!

178
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,500
It's my turn, my turn!

179
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,120
If you don't give me an explanation, I'll end myself here!

180
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,700
-Sir, put down that spoon first, and let's talk peacefully.
-Sir? Who's your Sir?

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,440
Sit down first. I'll take it out on you later.

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
Xu Youyou!

183
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,430
How can you do this to me-

184
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,380
-Anxin?
-Brother?

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,430
Don't you understand our signals?

186
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,540
It's not that. Didn't we agree that when you raise your glass, we should rush over?

187
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,870
I gave new signals to you behind my back. So many times.

188
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,280
'No', 'no', telling you not to come over.

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,450
I thought you were intentionally encouraging us as part of the act.

190
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,470
Besides, Ansheng doesn't look much like he used to.

191
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,330
So that's how it is. That's fine.

192
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,190
Before, I was worried about what I would tell Mom and Dad about this.

193
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,730
If it''s Youyou, it's easier to handle.

194
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,960
Since neither of us wants to do blind dates,

195
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,120
each of us can have our own reasons and it will be fine.

196
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,020
<i>This is a cooked duck that's right in front of me</i>

197
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,710
<i> but it can't fly. </i>

198
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,760
<i> Sister, you have to think of something. </i>

199
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,200
Nevertheless, I think that you and Youyou have some destiny together.

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,980
This has brought us together. Isn't that right?

201
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,510
It is indeed quite a coincidence.

202
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,010
Brother.

203
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,160
How do I say this...Youyou is a high quality, outstanding woman, right?

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,700
How about...

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,260
Don't meddle in this.

206
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,150
<i> He must be shy.  Be mild and tactful. </i>

207
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,380
<i> Use outflanking tactics. </i>

208
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,860
<i> Received. Over. </i>

209
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,590
I suddenly remembered something.

210
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,610
You are both being pressured to get married. If this goes bad,

211
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,650
you'll surely be back at the mercy of your parents, right Youyou?

212
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,140
I've thought about it.

213
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,030
Why don't you collaborate a little.

214
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,390
Why don't you just go through with it and have an open marriage?

215
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,750
- What kind of collaboration? 
 - Pretend to be sweethearts.

216
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,310
That's not really fair to Youyou.

217
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,430
That would be great.

218
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,180
No; what I mean is

219
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,980
if you will help out, I won't have to be tormented by my parents anymore.

220
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Then...

221
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,430
- What do you think? 
 It's excellent.

222
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,360
Okay.

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
<i>So it was you.</i>

224
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,080
<i>[Mom]</i>

225
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,800
Hello.

226
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes, Mom. I'm with Youyou.

227
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,540
As soon as I got together with Youyou,

228
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,700
I felt that

229
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,030
love had arrived.

230
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes. Don't worry, Mom.

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,490
Okay. I'll talk to you when I get back.

232
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,680
Okay, I'm hanging up.

233
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,750
Perfect. Thank you, Brother.

234
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,140
I also need to send this to My mom's Moments [Chinese Facebook] so she can see it.

235
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,480
You have to send one of those posts parents like the most.

236
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,980
Like those with expressions like this....

237
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,460
smiling and that kind of thing.

238
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,700
- Roses? 
 - That works.

239
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,150
Hurry up.

240
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,720
Brother, I've just remembered that Zhao Lei and I have something to talk about.

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,370
Why don't you help us and see Youyou home.

242
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,700
What thing?

243
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,550
Don't we have a project to discuss?

244
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,380
Yes. A project.

245
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,440
= You guys go on ahead. 
 - Anxin.

246
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,650
You've gotten thinner again. Are you not eating well?

247
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,010
I am eating well.

248
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm a take-out delivery girl. How could I not eat well?

249
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,790
Hurry and go. Hurry.

250
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,760
Is eating take-out good enough?

251
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,030
Brother, don't go on like a broken record. Worry about the important things in your own life.

252
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,940
Hurry. Go on.

253
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,170
Are you really so interested in matching Youyou and I?

254
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,360
I do want to make that match.

255
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,700
Every windy, moonless night, when I think about my perfect brother,

256
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,300
a person in utter isolation,

257
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,140
my heart aches.

258
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,140
Hurry up and go. Go on.

259
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,860
Bye-bye.

260
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,110
- Go for it. 
 - I'm afraid.

261
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,190
What's there to be afraid of?

262
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,040
Isn't that Looking Northwest Into Chang'an?
<i>(T/N Her username)</i>

263
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,280
It really is. I've seen everything. Heavens.

264
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,550
It's Looking Northwest Into Chang'an!

265
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,930
Can I get your autograph? I just love your cartoons.

266
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,620
Me too.  I love them too.

267
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,660
Okay.

268
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,360
Sister Chang Anxiin, could you do more?

269
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,620
It's definitely not enough.

270
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,830
Exactly; you can't leave it unfinished.

271
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,670
Nonsense. How could it go unfinished?

272
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,840
After the new technology was released, in as short as three months.

273
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,690
The revenue for Cai Niao Station increased up to four points.

274
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,620
Cai Niao Station continues to use the most advanced technology.

275
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,990
To focus on improving the experience for customers.

276
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,790
Our courier station started from zero and got to where it is now.

277
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,180
Xing'er, this is the result of your efforts.

278
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,790
Dad, it's all because you had the foresight.

279
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,730
It's also thanks to New Way's advanced techniques

280
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,430
combined with Cai Niao Station's original techniques.

281
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,930
The feedback from our customers is also very good.

282
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,370
We are continuously gaining users.

283
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,980
This means Ling Yue

284
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,120
is pretty capable.

285
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,250
Chairman. Isn't out company planning to create a payment software?

286
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,830
Why don't we connect with some of the resources Xing'er has.

287
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,150
Xing'er. I only want to ask you one question.

288
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,710
Is the data base of this in your own hands?

289
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,490
It's in the hands of New Way.

290
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,540
Those resources are so valuable. I'm afraid

291
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,930
he won't hand it over to someone easily.

292
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,800
The resources are indeed valuable.

293
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,000
But it's still not as precious as my daughter.

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,150
I deeply trust the place Xing'er has in his heart.

295
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,180
Give him a call. Tell him

296
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,670
he can require whatever conditions he wants.

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,770
Dad. This...

298
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,330
Why are you embarassed? I'll do it!

299
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,650
<i>Hello, who is it?</i>

300
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,140
President Ling, I'm Xing'er.

301
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,880
<i>Gu Group wants to talk with New Way</i>

302
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
about the facial recognition collaboration.

303
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,020
This isn't an area included in our collaboration.

304
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,760
Dad. I don't think the timing is right.

305
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,540
Xiao Yue. I'm your Uncle Gu.

306
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,180
Listen carefully. What Xing'er just said

307
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,640
is what I want. The business sector our families maintained all these years

308
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,300
has always been on good terms.

309
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,850
We should be helping each other out.

310
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,220
How about this. As long as you hand me the resources,

311
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,280
no matter what conditions you make I will be willing to negotiate.

312
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,230
-What do you think?
-Apologizes, President Gu.

313
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,710
The information of customers isn't something that can be measured using other conditions.

314
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,530
<i>I am still quite busy so I won't continue to bother you. Goodbye.</i>

315
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,590
Ling Yue is so disrespectful.

316
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,650
Dad. I'll tell him in person later.

317
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,980
No need!

318
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,330
He really doesn't take his opportunities and likes to do things the hard way.

319
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,390
I will wait until the day he begs me.

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,650
Ask the Technology Department to strengthen the security  these coming days.

321
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,310
Understood.

322
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,300
<i>[Galaxy cool man]</i>

323
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,000

324
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400

325
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,200

<i>Would you be feeling a lot of pressure?</i>

329
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,400
What's wrong, Miss Main Author? You still don't have ideas?

330
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,500
I really don't know

331
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,100
what choice she should make.

332
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,000
It's alright. Take your time.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, right. Your draft fee

334
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,100
should already be deposited. Go check it.

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands...

336
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,600
Oh my god! I've never made so much money before!

337
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,400
If it's too much, why don't you return some to me?

338
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Thanks, Boss.

339
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,800
How is it, Miss Main Author?

340
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,100
I think I've already reached my limit.

341
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,200
No way, let me see.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,310
I'm telling you. It's because you're hungry.

343
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,200
Eat some fruit.

344
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
How are you so caring?

345
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm telling you. Ansheng sent all these to me.

346
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not fruit I'm eating, it's another couple's affection.

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,800
My parents also said that there's destiny between us and look like husband and wife.

348
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,900
He's already met your parents? That fast?

349
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,000
Opportunities must be grasped early.

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,600
Why are you staring at me? I know I'm pretty.

351
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Ansheng...has handsome features

352
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,200
with a straight nose and striking looks.

353
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,600
You...with 400 degrees eyesight and dead fish eyes.

354
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
Husband and wife...well if you think so.

355
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
What do you mean?

356
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll stop talking. I value my life.

357
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,800
-You better speak clearly!
-I won't!

358
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
-Speak!
-No!

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
-No, speak clearly!
-You're letting me speak?

360
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Speak!

361
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,100
Abstract.

362
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,600
You look way to abstract. There's no word to match in the dictionary.

363
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Zhao Lei! You-

364
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll stop! But you're the one who told me to talk.

365
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,500
Stop, stop, stop. I was wrong.

366
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,300
<i>I really like Sister Chang An!</i>

367
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,800
<i>These few chapters are dragging on too much.</i>

368
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,100
<i>She can't be too busy with interviews and not want to update, right?</i>

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
<i>I think Sister Chang An drew it well.</i>

370
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>Isn't it tiring to update everyday? Can everyone be more understanding?</i>

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,100
What are you looking at?

372
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,000
Nothing.

373
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,600
You can't be looking at something embarrassing, right?

374
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,100
Looking at what?

375
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,000
We're all adults. I understand.

376
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,210
What do you understand now?

377
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,250
There's no need to...clarify, right?

378
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't need that.

379
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Really? Oh, I see.

380
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,600
You're aware of my ability, right? It seems it's been too long, and you've forgotten.

381
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Should we review?

382
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,300
It's the middle of the day. Don't say something so embarrassing.

383
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So don't you go encouraging me in the middle of the day.

384
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Oh, right. Send me your Alipay account.

385
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Why?

386
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,400
Don't I still owe you 82,000 Yuan? I can pay you back now.

387
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,900
Because right now, I count as

388
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,190
a small, small, small upstart.

389
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,200
So I can pay you back what I owe.

390
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm not in a hurry about the money. It's not like you're going to run away.

391
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,700
That can't do! I need to get rid of my poor identity as soon as possible.

392
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,000
How are you poor now?

393
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,500
I can't just always not repay what I owe.

394
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,400
If possible, I want you to owe me for your entire life.

395
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
What did you bring me here for?

396
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
For a date.

397
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,800
A date? At such a hardcore place? It...doesn't really suit me.

398
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Let's go. You'll find out soon.

399
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,800
This is where I first established New Way.

400
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,200
At the time, no one had high expectations for New Way.

401
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,000
In order to increase productivity and improve technology,

402
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I remained here without sleep or rest for a long time.

403
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,560
But I still failed at the time.

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,900
Failed?

405
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,400
Because I overestimated the market's needs at the time.

406
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,200
So all the products I made couldn't be sold.

407
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,900
The company had to pay for the losses.

408
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
But you still succeeded.

409
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Or else how could there be the New Way of today?

410
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Have you ever thought about

411
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,400
how if everything went smoothly for me then,

412
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I would definitely would have been delighted over my own talent.

413
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,000
And wouldn't have the New Way of today.

414
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Every failure brings seed for success.

415
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,290
Any wrong step you take isn't necessarily correct or incorrect.

416
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,000
As long as you stay true to your heart,

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,800
then all the failures will be your treasures in the future.

418
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,030
I won't give up.

419
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,600
President Ling, the technical division has a problem.

420
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,050
President Ling, this time we've learned from past failures

421
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,100
and added multiple layers of succeed to the facial recognition system.

422
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,950
Since you think you're not at fault,

423
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,200
then speak louder and clearly.

424
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Yes, President Ling.

425
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,600
The loophole that the internet refers to doesn't exist.

426
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,000
We've already added multiple layers of security to the facial recognition system as per your orders.

427
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,400
We've created a detailed inspection report.

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,900
Do you think we should publicize the results of our inspection report?

429
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,960
Or else if this continues, I'm afraid it will

430
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,400
affect our first year anniversary celebratory event.

431
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Immediately publicize the inspection report. Other publicity methods will proceed at the same time.

432
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
Go work with the property manager and obtain security camera footage.

433
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Yes, sir.

434
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Has Cai Niao Inn made a move?

435
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
No.

436
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,800
It seems this matter...is connected to the Gu Group.

437
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Immediately cut off all informational routes with the Gu Group.

438
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,900
Yes, sir.

439
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,080
President Ling, there's trouble in America.

440
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,600
Speak.

441
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,800
The brands that were to attend our preparatory anniversary event and already signed contracts

442
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,200
have just claimed they no longer wish to support New Way.

443
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,400
How can they do that?

444
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
There's no loophole. Who reported that?

445
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,400
Also, the Gu Group suddenly decided to hold a website banquet.

446
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,600
Apparently, they have already made contact with America.

447
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
We haven't even started investigating,

448
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,800
yet that old fox has already shown his tail.

449
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,900
Hello.

450
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,600
Hello, please give me a vanilla creampuff.

451
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,100
Alright.

452
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,160
<i>[Strong Start]</i>

453
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,000
<i>[Loophole found in collaborative technology created by Cai Niao Inn and New Way]</i>

454
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,500
What's going on with New Way?

455
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,000
Immediately send an announcement denying it.

456
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Boss, the Chairman said we aren't allowed to respond to this matter.

457
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
Alright. I understand.

458
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,000
Then what should we do now?

459
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Listen to the Chairman's orders for now.

460
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,800
Nice ball!

462
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
How's it going with the Second's matters?

463
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,600
The Second's fallen pretty hard this time due to Gu Yuanchao.

464
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,200
I'm afraid he won't be able to recover.

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Who said you can call him Second?

466
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,390
Isn't President Ling-Young Second Master Ling's fall

467
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,800
exactly what you wanted to see?

468
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,250
We can simply sit and wait for profit as those two dogs to

469
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,600
fight it out.

470
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,000
Turn around.

471
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,400
Turn around!

472
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
Is there something behind me?

473
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,400
Who are you calling a dog?

474
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,300
If he's a dog, then what am I? If he's a dog, then what am I?

475
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
President Ling, you've misunderstood! I don't mean it that way!

476
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
No! I don't mean it that way!

477
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,700
-You're still explaining? 
-Please listen to me!

478
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,400
If he's a dog, then what am I?

479
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,960
First, we need to stabilize things in America.

480
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,550
Ling Yue brought the promotional record to me for free. Why wouldn't I use it.

481
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,430
Our activities still have to be released as planned.

482
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,670
Yes. Don't worry. We are not only willing to invest money for them, but will also pay liquidated damages.

483
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,420
There won't be a second company that offers this treatment.

484
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,020
Come in.

485
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,080
Chairman, then I'll take my leave.

486
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,020
Dad.

487
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,640
We took a big blow for our focus on New Way this time.

488
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,470
Should we clear up stating that there is nothing wrong and think of another solution?

489
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,850
Xing'er, you've been treated unfairly.

490
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,780
I know your station has been very successful.

491
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,380
It's very outstanding in many aspects and got involved unwillingly.

492
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,380
But this is what it looks like on the outside.

493
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,110
The key to a successful enterprise

494
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,960
is to think long-term.

495
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,910
Think about it. New Way isn't just a company Ling Tian favors.

496
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,540
It might me the key to the future development of Ling Group.

497
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,440
If we sacrifice a small station to knock him down.

498
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,350
Do you think this sacrifice is worth it?

499
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,880
-Dad.
-Don't say anything.

500
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,720
I know you're here to speak for him.

501
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm not here to speak for him. I'm here to discuss business with you.

502
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,230
What business?

503
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,010
Haven't you always wanted to take down New Way?

504
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,120
Rather than killing 1,000 enemies with a sacrifice of 800,

505
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,710
why don't we think of a new plan?

506
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,760
Continue.

507
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,190
The best way is to unite with Ling Group through marriage.

508
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,900
Last time he didn't try to give you face.

509
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I think his heart already belongs to someone else.

510
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,240
That's not important. What's important is

511
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,330
that he can't ask anyone for help now.

512
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,520
That is true, but doesn't he still have that Old Man Ling Tian?

513
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,200
He has always wanted to escape from the control of Uncle Ling.

514
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,210
So he definitely won't ask him for help.

515
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,150
What's wrong? Are you okay?

516
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,270
Don't look, don't look.

517
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,040
Let's go.

518
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,990
Thanks, brother.

519
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,200
Why don't we call the police?

520
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,240
Forget it.

521
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,160
I don't want to cause a ruckus.

522
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,120
Do you know who did it?

523
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,410
I think it should be crazy fans.

524
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,930
I've stopped working for too long.

525
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,980
They must be using these methods to rush me.

526
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,400
Why don't you move back?

527
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,320
It's too unsafe to live alone.

528
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,900
Don't worry, it's really fine.

529
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,640
Right, why did you come over today?

530
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,330
I called you so many times and you didn't pick up. I thought something happened to you.

531
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,710
Sorry, since I've been quarantining, I've turned off all my notifications.

532
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,460
Quarantine?

533
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,410
It's to...find inspiration.

534
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,470
You look exhausted. Have you eaten yet?

535
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,080
I've eaten.

536
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,320
You...Have you not been eating on time?

537
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,400
It's not too late to eat now.

538
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,480
What do you want to eat? I'll order our takeout together.

539
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,070
Okay, stop ordering takeout.

540
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,270
I'll make some food for you.

541
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,160
What do you want to eat?

542
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,740
Anything.

543
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,470
Okay.

544
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,700
Brother

545
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,370
What happened to New Way?

546
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,240
Being targeted by business rivals is very common.

547
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,480
Don't think too much.

548
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,720
You can't tell Ling Yue what happened today.

549
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,630
I don't want to cause trouble for him.

550
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,380
Why would you...

551
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,460
be a bother?

552
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,200
<i> New Way </i>

553
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,280
Why is she here?

554
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,260
In times like this, Miss Gu dared to come to New Way.

555
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,410
I've heard that Cai Niao Station has taken a blow because of her.

556
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,970
This President Gu. In order to beat us, he's willing to do anything. That's too overboard!

557
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,000
Didn't she have an ambiguous relationship with President Ling?

558
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,820
It can't be that this time...

559
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,460
That's hard to say.

560
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,730
President Ling, can we talk alone?

561
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,870
Regarding New Way's current problem, I have a solution.

562
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,500
Why are you helping New Way?

563
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,080
Your surname is Gu, so shouldn't you be on the side of Gu Group?

564
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,200
Anxin's surname is Gu too.

565
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,940
Why don't you suspect her help at all?

566
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,040
Anxin is different.

567
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,150
My identity now is not part of the Gu family,

568
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,150
but an entrepreneur that you've helped before.

569
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,160
Things about Newbie Station is a mutual collaboration that doesn't talk about helping or not.

570
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,350
Other people don't understand you, but I do.

571
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,410
You won't invest in a company that you haven't researched at all.

572
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,940
Did you really not know Cai Niao Station is my company

573
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,730
before investing a lot of money in it?

574
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,460
What I saw was its business value.

575
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,040
No matter what, you've helped me before.

576
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,000
So this time, I won't just stand by and watch.

577
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,810
What is Gu Yuanchao's condition?

578
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,330
Marriage.

579
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,470
<i>Why will the marriage of our two families be useful for you guys?</i>

580
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,210
<i>Not only can it free New Way from the current stock situation.</i>

581
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,280
We can create an e-commerce platform in the future.

582
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,400
Why wouldn't I support this win-win situation.

583
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,680
Boss has been talking for a long time.

584
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,940
I don't even know what he's talking about.

585
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,290
A man and woman alone in an office, what can they talk about?

586
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,160
But it wouldn't be bad if the boss is with Ms. Gu.

587
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,500
Then we wouldn't have to worry about the danger of the company.

588
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,820
Ms. Gu...They couldn't be talking about Gu Xin'er right?

589
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,440
If you're worried about hurting Anxin,

590
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,970
I can tell her clearly that this a plan for the two wins of our companies.

591
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,240
That this is just a publicity engagement.

592
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,870
When this is over,

593
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,390
we will go back to before.

594
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,410
Brother Yue, your tie is crooked.

595
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,110
Ling Yue!
