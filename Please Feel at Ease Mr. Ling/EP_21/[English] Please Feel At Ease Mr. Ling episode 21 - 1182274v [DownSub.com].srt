00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,370
There are so many words that aren't clear.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,080
I'll help you read them.

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,120
I'm just finding out

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,170
that she tried to look happy

26
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,540
so she didn't affect me.

27
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,950
If she hadn't met my father,

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,770
would she have not had to suffer this much?

29
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,560
Would she have been happier?

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,970
At least, the heart-felt smile here can't be faked.

31
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,140
Auntie experienced happiness.

32
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,430
At least, you have some shared memories.

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,180
In the future, I'll do my very best not to bring work home and spend more time with you.

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,730
How can that be good. You need to do good work.

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,830
Isn't there a saying that says, 'A man who works earnestly

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,510
shines and touches others'?

37
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,810
If...if you can shine more warmly, that's even better.

38
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,090
How's this?

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,130
Not just towards me.

40
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,930
You should be that way towards everyone around you.

41
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,880
For example...Ai Li.

42
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,370
For example...Xiao Yishan.

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,300
- For example...
 - Xiao Yishan?

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,390
Forget about Xiao Yishan.

45
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,850
He's a dynamo.

46
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,160
Hello. Do you want to have dinner together with Xiao Ai?

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,840
Excuse me. Wait just a second.

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
It's not too convenient today; some other day.

49
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,320
Look how much genuine sincerity I'm showing in bringing all this.

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,690
You couldn't be so heartless as to leave all this outside your door.

51
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,960
I still have work to do today.

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,920
Hello, President Ling

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,770
Okay. I'll do that right now.

54
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,280
You can't disturb your employees after work hours.

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
<i> Are you with Xiao Yishan? </i>

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
- I'm sorry, President Ling. Actually... 
 <i> - I won't bother you two. </i>

57
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,480
Just look at this room.

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,760
It's really unique.

59
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,260
It's all Ling Yue's fault. He's worked you so hard

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,780
you don't even have time to keep your house in order.

61
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,590
You go ahead and go back to your room and work.

62
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,760
Leave this to me. In half an hour,

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,360
I'll change this into a new world.

64
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,040
What do you think? Am I amazing?

65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Last time I was at your house, I thought it was so empty.

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,990
So this time, I brought Xiao Ai's luxury house

67
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,450
and decompression toys.

68
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,520
At the same time, I've been able to display my cooking skills.

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,280
And I bought some cooking utensils for you.

70
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,970
I don't cook at home. I can't use these cooking tools.

71
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,420
Can't I just come often, then?

72
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,840
Don't move your hands and feet.

73
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm not that used to

74
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,000
- being too close and touching other people. 
 - Aiya.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,140
We're one family; why look at me like an outsider?

76
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,550
Don't be like that.

77
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,430
If you keep that up, I'll become a disabled person. Fortunately, I'm a doctor and I can save myself.

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,310
Eat.

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,110
Try it.

80
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,690
How is it?

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,400
Is it delicious?

82
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,570
I just don't like to waste food.

83
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,630
Last time, you said you didn't like boxing.

84
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,960
Then what do you like and not like?

85
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,790
I...like going to work.

86
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,720
I don't like getting off work.

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,750
That's all because of that unscrupulous Ling Yue. What ordinary person wants to go to work?

88
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,590
So what sort of private life, circle of friends do you have?

89
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,010
I'm not very good at socializing.

90
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,660
- What about your family? 
 - My family are all abroad.

91
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,290
And, I don't really have any close relatives now.

92
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,890
Since you lack family here, can I look after you?

93
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,990
Actually, after I twisted my back last time,

94
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,770
and you came to take care of me,

95
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,580
A lot of images were in my head.

96
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,830
I suddenly wondered

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,450
whether the life of two people together

98
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,040
would be much more lovely than a single person?

99
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,260
So, will you allow me to enter your life,

100
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,170
let me spend my time with you?

101
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,880
Could we...truly be together?

102
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,330
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,080
- I'm still not...
 Enough! Stop. I got it.

104
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,290
Don't tell me anything like, 'don't love me'.

105
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,440
We haven't reached that yet.

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,040
You haven't every done that; so how could you reject it?

107
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,670
It's fine. I'll wait for you.

108
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,380

The tears in this large pair of eyes

117
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,760
are all admiration of such narcissism.

118
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,200
Careful with your words. This isn't narcissism.

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,250
It's exceptional talent.

he says alot but never gets to the point

scold you? then hit him back

176
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,220
your fighting is really good you don't need to be scared of him

177
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,690
don't say it like that

178
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,490
If it wasn't for President Ling, I wouldn't be who I am today

179
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,250
actually I know you guys have a story just to embarrassed to ask

180
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,120
why don't you share with me today

181
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,260
Good! Go!

182
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes! Hit Him!

183
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,230
Great! Fight!

184
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,500
This is our most

185
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,120
promising fighter

186
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,950
He can for sure protect you

187
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,050
I'snt my recommendation good?

188
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,410
What did you do? What did you do?

189
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,420
Doing this on purpose? This pay check

190
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,250
and your doggy bonus is gone

191
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,860
I pick her

192
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,580
are you sure?

193
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,530
I have so many better than her

194
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,760
From now on you can work for me

195
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,510
Lucky, you got yourself a owner

196
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,900
Thats not her name

197
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,790
Her name is...

198
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
Aili

199
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,310
If president Ling didn't save me...

200
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,350
from that place

201
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,090
then I would not be here today

202
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,330
I understand how you feel

203
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,730
some scars don't heal

204
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,990
when you feel you have more happiness

205
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,180
then you will have more fear of losing it

206
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,090
you will want to avoid

207
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,260
keep a distance from them

208
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,240
but it's because you value them

209
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Aili when I met LingYue

210
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,350
I never thought I would be this happy

211
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,160
But accepting someone isn't this difficult

212
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,500
I can and you can

213
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,790
I'm driving President Ling to a dinner banquet.

214
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,490
I am with President Ling

215
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,550
I'm helping President Ling with official duties.

216
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,730
Did she hire a robot to reply you?

217
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,710
She's extremely cruel online and offline.

218
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,010
In fact, with the emotional stage you both are in now,

219
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,960
you don't need to sound each other out any further.

220
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,750
You just need to give her a clear answer.

221
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,540
to dispel the doubts and worries in her heart.

222
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,260
Give her a sense of ritual that belongs only to her.

223
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,460
In this way, she will know that she's being loved.

224
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,180
Alright.

225
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,540
Why it is you, what are you doing here?

226
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,480
This is the first place where we met Xiao Ai.

227
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,030
In a blink of an eye, a long time has passed.

228
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Yes, it is the same.

229
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,270
So...

230
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,440
our relationship,

231
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,110
is that more closer?

232
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,890
Maybe.

233
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,200
Ai Li,

234
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,330
I want to tell you.

235
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,160
First time I met you.

236
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,010
I like you.

237
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,610
I first thought we would just be a friend.

238
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,540
when I feel myself

239
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,050
expose all my shortcomings to you,

240
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,480
there will be no escape from fate.

241
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,120
Hence,

242
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,570
will you hand over your Achilles Heel to me

243
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,210
and stop being the invulnerable Ai Li?

244
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,320
Let me protect you.

245
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,090
The trajectory of the meteorite is, in fact, very light.

246
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,840
During that period of time,

247
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,370
it seems like it's going to fly out from the sky.

248
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,710
However, from the start till the end, it's attracted by the gravity of earth.

249
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,080
And will eventually approach earth.

250
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,400
Just like you and me.

251
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,460
I met you.

252
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,910
Idiot.

253
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,380
I just told you.

254
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,850
You really forgot what it's said.

255
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,730
<i>Promise me that</i>

256
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,690
<i>we will be together.</i>

257
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,850
<i>Yes, I promise you.</i>

258
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,320
Xiao Yishan,

259
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,180
I don't want you to protect me.

260
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,920
Because I am capable of protect myself.

261
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,900
But

262
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,380
I am willing to try to be with you.

263
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,790
Yay!

264
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,490
I'm sorry, were you waiting long?

265
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,280
No

266
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,740
I was just thinking about, the last time watching shooting stars

267
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,740
was back in high school

268
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,120
that time I was there, in front of the school fields

269
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,120
But I'm an adult. This is the first time I believe in this kind of wishes from meteorite.

270
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,990
why do I feel like you don't believe in wishes

271
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,930
after meeting you I believe now

272
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,790
what wish did you make?

273
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,030
Lingsheng

274
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,920
are you a simple or complex person?

275
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,430
why do you ask?

276
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,340
In front of you I am as I am

277
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,120
Then how did you know I was at Dongjiao Tower

278
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,980
Did you ask someone to spy on me?

279
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,170
I was worried something might happen to you

280
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,420
nothing happened

281
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,130
I was afraid you might get hurt

282
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,180
I hoped I could be there to protect you

283
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,650
just see it as just a caring act

284
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,160
but Xiner I did not have other intentions, please believe me

285
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,610
Okay, I believe you

286
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,450
Xiner I have a special present to give you

287
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,260

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,960
Oh Xiner, when did you come home last night?

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,890
Are you blind? you did this on purpose!

338
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,410
It was an accident

339
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,630
Accident?

340
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,040
Accidentally got the scholarship

341
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,190
Accidentally got the competition opportunity

343
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,970
I think you did on purpose, you have the most ulterior motives

344
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,790
I didn't do it on purpose...

345
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,800
I got your clothes dirty let me repay you

346
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,830
Okay, if it was on accident

347
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,290
then I accidentally bumped into you too

348
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,200
is that okay, I'll bump you right...

353
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,560

not for you to repay me

357
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,740
is for you to get revenge

358
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,630
one day you can fight for yourself

359
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,700
slowly don't rush

360
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,470
the person that harmed you will get what she deserves

361
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,230
What do I say to her?

362
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,120
I need to teach you what to say?

363
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,860
Hello

364
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,170
<i>Anxin, is that you? I'm Yu Guo.</i>

365
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,570
Yuguo?

366
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,140
Where are you? looked for you for so long

367
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,970
I left the country for a while

368
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,860
Yuguo, are you doing well?

369
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,560
I want to see you

370
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,200
Of course

371
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,830
I'm really worried about you

372
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,760
I want to see you alone for the last time

373
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,410
Yuguo, please don't

374
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,210
wait for me... hello?

375
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,330
Miss Anxin?

376
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,360
Let Yuguo find a secluded place and keep Anxin hidden

377
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,280
you must watch her carefully, don't let anyone know. especially Ansheng

378
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,490
and when Lingyue comes and you get what you need

379
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,960
let them meet properly

380
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
and don't make mistakes

381
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,300
'I'm at the bottom of the building, come alone'

382
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,350
"the number you have dialed...'

383
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,380
Presinent Ling? the chair meeting will start soon

384
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,860
the other members are here now

385
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,440
let them know meeting is canceled

386
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,650
Anxin

387
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,360
Anxin

388
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,040
Anxin

389
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,740
Anxin

390
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,780
Anxin

391
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,940
Anxin! Where are you?

392
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,980
Tell him to come here

393
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,320
Anxin!

394
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,850
Anxin

395
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,410
Anxin

396
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,020
Anxin? Where are you?

397
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,880
Mr. Ling, i'm over here

398
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,190
Lingyue don't come here

399
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,590
Go! don't come here

400
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,080
Leave

401
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,390
Leave!

402
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,230
don't hurt her

403
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,370
what ever conditions you want

404
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,240
Ling I prepared something for you

405
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,240
go take a look

406
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,030
for this?

407
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,530
sign it

408
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,380
don't sign it, Lingyue don't do it

409
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,220
stay where you are

410
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,050
stop wasting time! sign it now!

411
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,820
Okay, i'll sign it

412
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,380
Don't sign.

413
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,890
'Ling Yue'

414
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,220
Here

415
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,100
Are you alright?

416
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,910
Lingyue, watch out!

417
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,930
Hello?

418
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,050
Yes I know, sent me the location

419
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,600
Lingyue

420
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,500
are you alright?

421
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,450
please, tell me your fine

422
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,300
i'm fine

423
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,300
i'm sorry... i'm sorry

424
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,870
In a moment you won't be fine

425
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,120
Yuguo, this is against the law

426
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,450
Mind your own business

427
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,940
i'm alright

428
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,970
then good, I'm done here

429
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,590
whatever happens next

430
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,170
is up to you

431
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,910
what do I do with those two

432
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,540
with just a fire

433
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,810
it can look like an accident between a lovers quarrel

434
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,460
then everything can looks like a secret taken to the grave

435
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,610
don't you hate her

436
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,660
heres your chance, don't waste it

437
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,330
why did you become like this, Yuguo?

438
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,880
Its because of you

439
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,630
If you didn't push me

440
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,280
would I be like this?

441
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,150
It wasn't like that

442
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,010
You losing your ability

443
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,010
is because of abutilon poison

444
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,790
You mistakenly swallowed alprazolam. That's why you are in this condition.

445
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,240
I have the medical records, I can show you

446
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,560
Please believe me

447
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,550
No way, I don't believe it

448
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,050
this many years you didn't have any evidence

449
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,210
when you are pushed to your death, now you do?

450
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,870
This is a misunderstanding between us

451
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,310
please let him go

452
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,560
he is without blame, let him go

453
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,400
if he is blameless, then i'm not?

454
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,620
did you know how hard was it for me to recover

455
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,370
when i think you get to live

456
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,420
then I'll let you live in pain

457
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
what happened

458
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,560
now it's exposed we need to contact the police

459
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,020
if I have to die then let's die together
