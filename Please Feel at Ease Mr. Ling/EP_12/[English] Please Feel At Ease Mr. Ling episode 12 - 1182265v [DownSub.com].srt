21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,230
So you guys were together before?

22
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,040
We absolutely did not.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,090
<i>We're just simply classmates.</i>

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,020
That's all.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,250
- Also, regarding the photo— 
 - I know about the photo.

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,330
It's obvious that she was using you.

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,720
I have such a smart brain. Of course I can think of that.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,680
So is it the same with being afraid of water?

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,820
Being afraid of water was all thanks to my elder brother.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
As long as you're by my side, I'll be at ease.

31
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,950
<i>After Johnny and them changed jobs last time,</i>

32
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,240
they left with the SA system that we were developing.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,300
Feite Group is about to release the SA system.

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,790
If they succeed in releasing it, then ours

35
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,420
will be worthless.

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,720
Most of Ling Fang's money was invested in Fang Yu Group.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,290
Developing these kinds of things cannot be done that easily.

38
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,250
Where did he get so much funds?

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,410
The people between Feite Group are from the company. I really don't understand.

40
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,040
<i>Why must these shareholders invest in Feite Group?</i>

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,320
<i>Looks like they're determined to follow Ling Fang.</i>

42
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,730
Ling Fang definitely promised those people that they'll get more in return

43
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,720
and is also preparing to divide the dividends for New Way.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,730
Let's go to Fangyu Group.

45
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,320
Okay.

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,790
Uncles, don't worry. I won't disappoint you guys.

47
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,100
Then we'll all rely on you, President Ling Fang.

48
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,320
You scared me!

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
W-why did you stand behind me and not make noise?

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,320
If you didn't do anything guilty then what is there to be afraid of, elder brother?

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm happy today. I won't hold a grudge.

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,300
You're so merciless this time by using the two-pronged approach.

53
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,730
This gave New Way a heavy blow while taking many huge shareholders from us.

54
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,050
Using Li Group's money to block off New Way's survival.

56
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,110
This is really a good method.

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,220
What do you think will happen if dad finds out?

58
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,250
Then tell him.

59
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,080
You were always a tattle teller anyways.

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,010
Let me put it this way. It's fine even if he finds out.

61
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,540
Let him see how I, Ling Fang, casually

62
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,360
A small company can easily replace the company, New Way, that you put all your efforts in.

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,370
Didn't you always say that only e-commerce

64
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,170
and technology can represent the future of the Ling Group?

65
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,050
I'll let you see what the future will look at.

66
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,760
You always want to defeat me.

67
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,880
- What do you want to prove? 
 - To prove that I'm the only successor to Ling Group

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
and you're nothing.

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,900
Aren't you afraid that you'll get eaten up by your greediness?

70
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,610
All of this was originally mines!

71
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,840
You just had a share of it!

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,100
How dare you say I'm greedy? Ridiculous.

73
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,430
What consequences?

74
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,300
What consequences?

75
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,720
I think you are just being a sour grape.

76
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,210
Then I hope your wish comes true.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,640
How come this brat isn't anxious at all?

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,420
Making me not feel good.

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,980
Is everything prepared?

80
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't let him have a chance.

81
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,540
He's a gecko who pokes into every nooks and corners.

82
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,740
Don't worry, everything has been prepared.

83
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,400

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,280
Nana, Jiejie, Beibei, and Xiao Chi, tell the people from your department to have a meeting with me.

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,000
- Okay.
 - Okay.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,100
<i>The hacker caused the company to lose and leak many important documents.</i>

88
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,290
<i>The company is now making arrangements to get them back.</i>

89
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,980
Less than 35% was found.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,300
In terms of abilities, we have two groups who wanted to resign.

91
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,090
<i>We need to arrange people immediately to get into those position.</i>

92
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,160
Are you trying to murder me?

93
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,740
I w-was practicing.

94
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,720
Practicing?

95
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,000
Why did you come?

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Your delivery girl is here to send you shrimps.

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,310
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

98
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,480
Let's go.

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,690
Very fresh grilled shrimped

100
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,050
with RIO,

101
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,600
is amazing.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you smell it?

103
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,780
What's wrong?

104
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,900
Don't tell me that you never ate grilled shrimps before.

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,310
Give it a try. Give it a try and you'll know. It's really tasty.

106
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll demonstrate for you.

107
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,940
Remove the head then the tail.

108
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,480
Give it a try. Let me do it.

109
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,990
I don't think this shrimp isn't ready for someone to eat it yet.

110
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,940
How is it? Is it tasty?

111
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,400
Put on the gloves. Here.

112
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,710
Is it tasty?

113
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,060
Your delivery girl has accomplished her mission today.

114
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,250
I won't disturb you from working. I'll get going first.

115
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,310
- Let me send you. 
 - No need, I can go back myself.

116
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,170
No, wait for me here. Let me go wash my hands.

117
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,760
I'll come back soon. Wait for me.

118
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>Don't worry, I'm here.</i>

119
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,010
<i>I won't take up your time from working overtime.</i>

120
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>Hurry and finish so you can come look for me.</i>

121
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,160
Gu Xin'er, look time no see.

122
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,380
This is the rich daughter of the Gu family.

123
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,260
She goes on the trending list quite often.

124
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,760
Isn't she the rumored girlfriend with the president of New Way recently?

125
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,900
<i>Is that so, Xin'er?</i>

126
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,010
What's going on with the Second Young Master of the Ling family?

127
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,210
You guys are considered childhood sweethearts.

128
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,940
Why did he personally come out to deny this issue with you?

129
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,020
I heard you're getting married. Congrats.

130
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,310
Is it the Master Chen that we took back our investment from?

131
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,200
No way, I dumped him long ago.

132
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,900
My fiancé is Qin Hui's son.

133
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,790
So, it's the son of President Qin who manages golf for VIP customers.

134
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,880
Since you and Young Master Qin are getting married, then please advise him

135
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
to stop sending me flowers each day. It's already been 2 years.

136
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,580
I don't want our company's cleaning staff to do

137
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,750
useless cleaning everyday.

138
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,840
You're spouting nonsense! It must be you who seduced him.

139
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,060
Are you fine?

140
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,850
I'm fine.

141
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,340
Auntie, this fairy sister already said

142
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,090
it's your fiancé with wishful thinking who keeps pestering her.

143
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,050
so please go back and control your man.

144
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,470
Stop splashing others in public.

145
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,760
Make it clear, who's an auntie?

146
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,740
How did you know I was here?

147
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,530
Looks I need to be cautious in my postings in the future.

148
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,350
Your fans won't like it.

149
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,430
Thanks for today.

150
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,980
But at this point, the art exhibition should be closed.

151
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,760
It's fine, there's always next time.

152
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,250
However, there seems to be a performance venue near here

153
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,880
just about to start operation.

154
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,330
Wait for me. I'm going to purchase the tickets.

155
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,760
What is it?

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,770
Don't worry. Everything has been prepared.

157
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,210
There's still 3 hours left before Fei Te's ceremony starts.

158
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,110
Is there any movement from New Way?

159
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,570
Nothing much.

160
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,540
Seems like my younger brother is trapped in a warm and cosy place and doesn't want to come out.

161
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,740
President Ling, you are really brilliant in using the element of surprise to your advantage.

162
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,710
Let me ask you. Is Ling Yue,

163
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,890
will he fail to save the hopeless situation?

164
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,580
Yes. He's in a hopeless situation

165
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,120
Am I handsome?

166
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,630
Handsome.

167
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,510
Let's go.

168
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,920
Hello?

169
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,740
Now?

170
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,040
- Boss 
 - What is it? Speak.

171
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,230
Feite just received a legal notice.

172
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,390
What do you mean?

173
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,980
New Way filed a lawsuit with the Dispute Department to sue for theft of trade secrets.

174
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,950
So sudden.

175
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,670
Do a news blackout. Feite must be listed as per normal.

176
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,720
What's that expression? Say it!

177
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,560
I'm afraid there's no way. It happened too suddenly.

178
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,540
The shareholders of the company have received the news.

179
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,050
They are selling their Feite's stocks at a low price.

180
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,690
These impatient old fogeys.

181
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,840
Can't hold back just because of a lawyer's notice.

182
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,070
It seems that the shareholders received an email last night.

183
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,050
It contained the turnover sales of Feite.

184
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,860
They're saying we're giving everyone empty checks and

185
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,500
that the promised growth rate is very hard to achieve.

186
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,010
Immediately, go buy all those circulating shares back. Do you hear me?

187
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,750
Yes

188
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,690
Come in!

189
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,960
President Ling.

190
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,060
I'm afraid you can't buy your shares back.

191
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,730
What do you mean?

192
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,970
Do you think that Fangyu Construction can't afford it?

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,230
Let's not talk about whether you can afford it.

194
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,520
The more important thing is whether I'm willing to sell to you.

195
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,290
What does it have to do with him?

196
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,920
It was you.

197
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,920
Let go! Let go!

198
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,770
Call security!

199
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,800
Are you afraid of a woman?

200
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,310
Look, President Ling, even if the security comes, they wouldn't be able to beat her.

201
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,270
This isn't that simple.

202
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,940
Why do I feel like I got tricked?

203
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,740
Did you plan it a long time ago?

204
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,220
Big bro, do you think I didn't know you coveted New Way for a long time?

205
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,580
My car accident was also a part of your plan.

206
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,220
Stalling me, so that your Fei Te can rise easily.

207
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,490
You even have time to take away my team and stole New Way's core technology.

208
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,640
You already knew?

209
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,520
You did it on purpose!

210
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,150
In order to mess me up, you even dared to give me your own company's core technology. You're really cruel!

211
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,000
But you think you won?

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Let's see how long your company can last without the core technology.

213
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,250
I am still Fei Te's biggest shareholder!

214
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,760
Do you think that by taking away my team,

215
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,840
taking away the SA system,

216
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,260
New Way's will collapse?

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,750
Actually I need to thank you.

218
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,330
I always thought New Way's personals is redundant. All thanks to you,

219
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,930
you helped me do some staff reduction.

220
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,500
I've always invested within this country in outstanding freshman

221
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,810
to carry out fully automated technology research and development.

222
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,030
So far, it has been very effective and ready to enter the construction phase.

223
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,970
So that SA semi-automatic system,

224
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,720
it was an illusion created by you?

225
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,060
Originally, it wasn't.

226
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,300
It's only that big bro made me advance my plans. That's it.

227
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,780
If it weren't for your greediness,

228
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,560
maybe you wouldn't have lost so much today.

229
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,850
Also, if you keep being so greedy,

230
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,070
sooner or later, you will be swallowed by your ambition.

231
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,380
Either way, you won.

232
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,870
You get to have all the cool talk.

233
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,400
Damn.

234
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,870
Are you okay?

235
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,830
Hello, Director Liu.

236
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,320
No, it is definitely not like what the rumors say.

237
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,940
Our boss...

238
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,190
He isn't here. He left the country a few days ago.

239
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,120
Yes, yes.

240
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,010
Boss, what do we do?

241
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,050
Right now, all the shareholders are looking for you.

242
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,030
What do we do?

243
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,070
Let me think about it.

244
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,540
Everyone that's looking for me, tell them I'm not here.

245
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,270
Okay.

246
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,020
Hello...Director Zhou.

247
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,050
By the way, President Ling, the Dispute Department needs new evidence.

248
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
No need.

249
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,430
I understand.

250
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,590
<i>[Resume]</i>

251
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,610
All these resumes didn't get any response.

252
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,410
It's really hard for me to be a corporate slave.

253
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,220
Don't be anxious. I haven't found a job either.

254
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,310
If you really can't do it, just go back and be the CEO's wife.

255
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,080
Or inherit the CEO's family business. It's not bad too.

256
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,220
Look at you again. It's not like you don't know.

257
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,340
Look over there.

258
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,960
Let me tell you.

259
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,310
That person has been taking selfies ever since he sat down.

260
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,600
That's too narcissitic.

261
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,190
With his looks, opening dermabrasion and touch-ups,

262
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,460
-it's also not like this... 
- Manager Zhao.

263
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,250
Someone you know?

264
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,790
Stop pretending.

265
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,780
I know you guys have been observing me for a long time.

266
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,530
Waiter, give me a White Water.

267
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,750
Are you looking for a job?

268
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,860
- Yes 
 - Think about

269
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,610
- coming to my company. 
 - Your company?

270
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,410
Yes I've resigned and I'm going to start my own company.

271
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,220
I just met an author

272
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,300
but I think his price is rather high.

273
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,400
So I'm still thinking it over.

274
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,090
He just wants to jump bridges (switch jobs), but I can't find any jobs.

275
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,360
Your voice was quite loud earlier.

276
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,520
Great. Manager Zhao has great courage!

277
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,410
Just call me Zhao Lei.

278
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,190
Manager Zhao, why don't you consider Anxin as your business partner?

279
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,650
Our Anxin is a super Webtoon master.

280
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,900
Webtoon master?

281
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,470
No, she's speaking nonsense. I'm not some kind of Webtoon master.

282
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm someone that likes to draw mangas only.

283
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,950
What's your ID?

284
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,220
Northwest towards Chang'an.

285
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,350
Excuse me, I couldn't hold it.

286
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,690
I'll do it myself!

287
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,420
Your lipstick doesn't seem to be waterproof.

288
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,350
Apply Armani lipstick and l will smear it for you.

289
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,100
Don't. I don't have any intention of setting foot into the beauty circle lately.

290
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,820
Northwest towards Chang'an, I have always been your fan.

291
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,240
You've seen my work?

292
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,700
Of course!

293
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,800
Not long ago, I pursued this and accidently, picked up a prince.

294
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,030
However, not long after, it stopped uploading. I was even sad for a long time.

295
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,180
Why aren't you uploading anymore?

296
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,380
Y-y-you can come to my company.

297
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,970
You only need to invest in the copyrights.

298
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,200
So this job is

299
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,370
just the two of us?

300
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,640
Our office will expand very quick.

301
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,250
How about including my good friend You You too?

302
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,890
Her sketches are super fast and smooth.

303
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,910
Really?

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,600
So how?

305
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Not bad. You have talent.

306
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,500
But who is this?

307
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
Mike, an idol.

308
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,200
Most of his drawings are done by You You.

309
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I don't know him. But it's ok.

310
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,300
Then Miss You You, are you willing to join our company?

311
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
I'll think about it.

312
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't think.

313
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,600
You can't find a job anyway. Let's just do it together.

314
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
How do you know I can't find a job?

315
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Would people who can find a job be like you guys?

316
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,500
Just chatting in a cafe in the middle of the day?

317
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,200
How about it?

318
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,200
Fine. I'll join.

319
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,500
Then what's our company called?

320
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
Galaxy Cool Man!

321
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
All finished.

322
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
Isn't still crooked?

323
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
It's not crooked. The logo I designed is supposed to be tilted.

324
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
That's right, it's fine.

325
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,700
Let's go take a look inside.

326
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,700
Look, how is it?

327
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,400
The new renovation cost quite a big sum of money. It's not bad.

328
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
The photos are rather nice.

329
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
I was diligent, okay?

330
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Oh right, Anxin that's your spot.

331
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,400
This is the CEO's spot. You You just sit there.

332
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,600
Why am I here?

333
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,300
Because you're close to the door and can easily get the takeout.

334
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,000
Right, we can put a sofa there and put up a poster here.

335
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,500
I think it's rather spacious here.

336
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Look, look who's here.

337
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,010
Why are you here?

338
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,100
Boss, can I work here?

339
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,800
Don't block me.

340
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
This person is totally senseless. Come, help me to tidy up.

341
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
Don't stop me from looking at how lovey-dovey they are.

342
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes, food and housing is included, but no salary.

343
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,300
When do I sign the contract?

344
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Let's go get some food.

345
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Why did you bring an umbrella?

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
It's going to rain today.

347
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,200
It's going to rain? How can that be when it's so sunny.

348
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Don't you check the weather report?

349
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,000
The weather report is always inaccurate so I never look at it.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Then let's pretend today it's accurate.

351
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,590
I planned ahead. Is there a reward for me?

352
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,580
They're looking.

353
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Now it's okay.

354
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,000
♫ <i>The first time I met you, I have never thought there would come a day</i> ♫

355
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

356
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,400
♫ <i>You are full of coldness. No way to get close</i> ♫

357
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,900
♫ <i>Prepare for plan two at any time</i> ♫

358
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,200
Anxin, someone delivered warmth again.

359
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Look what it is.

360
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,300
Don't be so nosy. Come help me.

361
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,300
A ball?

362
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,910
<i>The weather is sunny today. Average temperature is 20°C.</i>

363
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,000
<i>The temperate at night is 18°C.</i>

364
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,500
<i>Please wear more clothes to prevent catching a cold.</i>

365
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,200
This is, unexpectedly, a smart globe.

366
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
<i>[I will name it Xiao Liu in the future.]
<i>[T/N : Little Six]</i></i>

367
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,400
<i>[You are Xiao Ba and it's Xiao Liu. Perfect match.]
<i>[T/N : Xiao Ba means Little Eight]</i></i>

368
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
<i>[You are my CP instead]
<i>[T/N : internet slang for Couple Pairing]</i></i>

369
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,400
<i>[Since you know we are CP, just study behind my back.]</i>

370
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
<i> I know much more than you think. </i>

371
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>[Bragging? Do you still remember that you short-circuited my microwave?]</i>

372
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,400
<i>[You are not a grounded person.]</i>

373
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
<i>Grounded? Just wait.</i>

374
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,800
<i>It's 12 noon now. Time for lunch.</i>

375
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,800
<i>Take your lunch on time so that you will have good health.</i>

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,000
Why are you so talkative just like Ling Yue?

377
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
What happens if I don't eat lunch? Can you see me?

378
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Not eating on time can cause gastritis, stomach ulcers, and indigestion.

379
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,400
<i>It will reduce cerebral function and affect cerebral development.</i>

380
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,800
- Even this?
- It will also lead to a decline in intelligence...
- I'm going. Stop talking.

381
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Eat!

382
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,800
Is no one going to help me change the water?

383
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,400
President Ling

384
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,900
It's done.

385
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,500
What's going on?

386
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Is the information prepared?

387
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
It's ready.

388
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,000
Can we still come back?

389
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
If this continues...

390
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,200
I will have nothing and no prospects in the future.

391
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,770
- It's a swift and violent collapse.
- That's right.

392
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,700
If this is the case, there won't be any future prospects.

393
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Alright, no more fighting.

394
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
Listen to me.

395
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
We are all aware of the situation now.

396
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Dear shareholders, please express your personal views.

397
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,300
Chairman, we and Director Ling Fang

398
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,200
We signed a clear contract.

399
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,000
He said that, in order to develop the the strength of the logistics industry, he fixed that whatever company.

400
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,760
Now, not only the promise was not fulfilled,

401
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
we have incurred losses too.

402
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,600
We are family. We don't want to take this to court too.

403
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,200
Chairman, please preside over this difficult situation for us.

404
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,300
Then what do you wish he do?

405
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,600
We just want back our original shares.

406
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,100
Since there's no money,

407
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,000
cash out Fang Yu Construction's stocks

408
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
to compensate everyone.

409
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,000
Are you trying to kill me?

410
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Shut up!

411
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,200
Such a big problem happened,

412
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,800
and you want to wash your hands of this?!

413
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,300
Do according to what they said.

414
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,600
Everyone, I have a better plan.

415
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,200
Currently, Fang Yu Construction has been badly hit.

416
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,000
Even if you cash out the stocks, it won't be able to make up for everyone.

417
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,900
At most it will only make everyone feel a bit better.

418
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,200
If everyone is willing, I can sell 5% of my New Way's shares

419
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,400
to you at a lower price.

420
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,600
Take it as my older brother's apology.

421
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
I believe everyone knows that New Way is going to be listed in the market.

422
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,900
This 5% profit

423
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,600
will be very promising in the future.

424
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,600
That's right. This is not a bad idea.

425
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,800
with the current situation.

426
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Fine.

427
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
It's a solution too.

428
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,100
Yes, it can make up for it.

429
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,600
Look, the report is rather positive. Lao Shen.

430
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,200
Fang Yu Construction is now just an entity without any content.

431
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Instead of being obsessed with it, why not choose choose one with a promising future?

432
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,600
It still requires us to spend money on stocks.

433
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,300
It doesn't look like a great plan.

434
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,200
Since it's like this, you all should just take my brother's shares.

435
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Taking into account our relationship with the Chairman,

436
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
I don't want to hesitate any further and go with the decision.

437
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,600
Chairman, we will pass this now. We don't want to delay the handling of your family's matters.

438
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Thank you all for making it out.

439
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,060
Eldest son.

440
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,670
I can't care how you harassed others with unreasonable demands in the past

441
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,570
but your approach has

442
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,570
threatened the interests within the group.

443
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,670
Fortunately, my second son has reaped some profits for you.

444
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,300
Otherwise, I won't be able to protect you.

445
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,880
Dad, I know my mistake.

446
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,900
You know your mistake? Which aspect?

447
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,400
I shouldn't be arrogant and switched from real estate to e-commerce.

448
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,140
My mistake was not predicting the risks and difficulties across the industries.

449
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,130
Let me tell you what your mistake is.

450
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,200
Your biggest mistake was to act recklessly.

451
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,280
Do you think this was due to lack of experience? It's not.

452
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,150
What you lack, is vision and insight.

453
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,830
One day, if you really sit in the Chairman's seat of this group,

454
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,540
how can you convince everyone in the company to

455
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,120
have faith in you that you can lead the company and move forward?!

456
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,350
Dad, have some water.

457
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,270
Cool down. Eldest Brother already know his mistake.

458
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,420
Have a good rest for this period.

459
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,720
Don't bother about the company for the time being.

460
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,400
- Dad...
- Let me tell you.

461
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,580
You should really be thankful to your younger brother for this.

462
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,300
Not only did he help you, he also redeemed huge losses for the Ling family.

463
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,600
Do you know this?

464
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,530
What's wrong? Can't sit still?

465
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,750
Not happy?

466
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,260
Dad, there are still company matters to attend to.

467
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,020
I'm leaving.

468
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,200
Look at how your younger brother handles matters.

469
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,580
You should really learn from him.

470
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,320
Same for you too.

471
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,600
How old are you?

472
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,760
You are twenty two years old and already an adult.

473
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,500
You are pursing a woman every day.

474
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,200
What are you pursuing?

475
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,730
Be more mature and promising, okay?

476
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,510
Hold on.

477
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,210
Why are you raising your guard?

478
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,320
He just helped me. What will I do to him?

479
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,460
Speak. Why did you help me?

480
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,300
You have clearly won.

481
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,620
Once I fall off the stage, everything in the Ling family will be yours.

482
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,540
But you insisted on pulling back at this moment.

483
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,330
I really don't understand your reason for doing this.

484
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,290
Winning or losing is not important to me.

485
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,520
I have never thought of fighting with you.

486
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,260
So, your motive for doing this, is for me to thank you?

487
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,260
I don't care about what you think.

488
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,490
Eldest Brother.

489
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,580
Since this has already happened, just let it pass.

490
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,400
You are overthinking.

491
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,990
I suddenly feel it's not interesting anymore.

492
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,850
What do you mean?

493
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:53,000
I just experienced a roller coaster.

494
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,710
This is good too. I'm suddenly relaxed.

495
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,400
Eldest Brother, where are you going?

496
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,980
Didn't Dad tell me to go on leave?

497
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm obeying him.

498
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,630
<i>[New Way]</i>

499
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,310
Go back to the company first. I'm heading out.

500
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,770
Okay.

501
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,820
Xin'er.

502
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,830
Why are you here?

503
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,520
I know you're working in the area today.

504
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,370
So I wanted to invite you to elope. Are you interested?

505
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,590
Eloping doesn't sound like something adults do.

506
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,360
I'm just joking.

507
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,720
I've come to ask about the date you've promised me.

508
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Where do you want to go?

509
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,180
For a spring outing.

510
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,440
I know there's a huge themed music festival in the suburbs.

511
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,940
I think you'll definitely like it.

512
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,550
But I still have some work I have to do.

513
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,420
It's fine. I knew you would reject me anyway.

514
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,600
Since you have to work overtime, eat more.

515
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,990
Replenish your energy and take good care of yourself.

516
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,390
Thank you.

517
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,130
So, I have awareness now?

518
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,020
But I really have work.

519
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,500
I know you're a big busy person. Go do your work.

520
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,200
Bye bye.

521
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,830
Excuse me, can I give this to you?

522
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,520
I just remembered, my company matters aren't that urgent.

523
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,320
Let's go out first.

524
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,570
Really? Then get in the car.

525
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,320
What's that?

526
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,590
I don't know.

527
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,900
Can I have some?

528
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,350
Here.

529
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,360
What is it? It's so sweet and doesn't taste good.

530
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,110
Let's go.

531
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,920
Great! My comic has already exceeded 100,000 clicks.

532
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,230
Look, the fans in the comments

533
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,680
Thousands of fans are asking for updates for Book of Blood.

534
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,580
Anxin, why do I suddenly feel that this Xiao Yin looks actually like me?

535
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,220
I drew it based on you.

536
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,850
Wouldn't it be wasteful if I don't make use of this beautiful face?

537
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,440
I'm embarrassed.

538
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,520
You should be.

539
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,260
No way. How can you girls keep flattering yourselves?

540
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,040
She has a pancake face. Compared to an oval face, se can't hang anything on it.

541
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,060
Zhao Lei, it's none of your business.

542
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,660
Sometimes, I realize you don't need to have a mouth.

543
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,970
I think it's perfect.

544
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,740
You guys talk.

545
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,560
I wanted to scare you. What's up? Why are you spying on me?

546
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Get in the car.

547
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,120
What's wrong?

548
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,480
Celebrating you guys getting over 100,000 views.

549
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,340
But I still have a lot to do.

550
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,120
You've been working continuously for a couple weeks.

551
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,880
You don't even have the right to a break?

552
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,260
I see other bosses torturing their employees.

553
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,890
But why are you doing it to yourself?

554
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,300
I don't have any employees to torture. The boss is me and the employee is me.

555
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,780
The cleaning lady is me too. Everything is me.

556
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,700
Who else can I torture but myself?

557
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Then where do you want to take me to?

558
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,910
Camping. Didn't you say I'm not grounded?

559
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,490
Camping?

560
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,010
You even know how to correct your mistake?

561
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,460
Okay then. I'm going back to get my drawing board.

562
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,380
My girlfriend is really a workaholic.

563
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,120
Well...

564
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,880
It's a long journey and you lack this super cute girl as companion.

565
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,620
And this beautiful man here can reluctantly accompany you too.

566
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,430
We...

567
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,830
No.

568
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:26,060
Anxin, we need a break too to prepare for the exceeding of one million clicks.

569
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,980
Right, let's pretend we're going together

570
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,920
to celebrate!

571
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,520
Let's go.

572
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,450
I won't be disturbing you, right?

573
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,800
Get ready.

574
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,050
♫ <i>We encountered in the street tonight</i> ♫

575
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,620
♫ <i>In her heart, her feet decided not to listen and went home with her</i> ♫

576
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,770
♫ <i>She used her faint eyes to quickly tell me</i> ♫

577
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,720
♫ <i>The slender and floating figure silently turned around</i> ♫

578
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,690
♫ <i>and told me, romantic lover, I love you</i> ♫

579
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,980
I already said so. Insisted on drinking two big bottles of water.

580
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,250
Wouldn't we be like this? I'm going to burst soon.

581
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:25,960
By the way, You You. We are going camping today. Can we really see that galaxy of stars in the sky?

582
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,090
- Yes. 
- Really?

583
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,720
I searched it up a few times online.

584
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,410
It said there are many enthusiastic campers at the observatory point here. We will definitely see them.

585
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,520
Then since we can see it, we won't be disappointed.

586
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,600
Can we eat this?

587
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,920
What do you want to eat and drink?

588
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,870
- Are you thirsty? 
 - I want to eat this but I'll get fat.

589
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,560
- You mean this? 
 - Xiao Sheng?

590
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,050
What a coincidence.

591
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,260
Second brother, sister-in-law you're also here.

592
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,930
What a coincidence. Where are you guys going?

593
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,500
We're going camping. What about you?

594
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,590
We were also finding a camping spot.

595
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,750
How about we go together?

596
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,630
Anxin, what a coincidence that you're here too.

597
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,360
What a coincidence.

598
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,270
Right, we were planning on camping too.

599
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,990
Since it's such a coincidence, let's go together.

600
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,650
Okay.

601
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,730
Then let's go together.

602
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,170
Im good

603
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,560
Yeah.

604
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,450
I'm so amazing.

605
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,300
It's so successful for the first time setting up a tent.

606
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,050
Help me take a picture.

607
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,560
Okay.

608
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,140
- Okay. 
 - Done? Let me take a look.

609
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,720
Am I cute?

610
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,990
Zhao Lei, I haven't seen such a narcissist like you.

611
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,340
You saw one today.

612
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,600
- Don't! 
 - You haven't taken the photo.

613
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,090
<i>Stop messing around.</i>

614
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:38,360
Are you upset that I called everyone over for camping?

615
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,810
I thought that rather than going to a music festival where we don't know anyone,

616
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,100
we would've been more happy to come camping together with everyone.

617
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,620
Its not because of my second brother?

618
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,910
Anxin is here too.

619
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,760
Look, everyone is here.

620
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,820
I won't be mad at you.

621
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,330
I just thought that it wasn't easy to finally get a chance to date you alone,

622
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,510
but who would've expected that everyone is here.

623
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,330
This isn't considered us dating alone.

624
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,980
Really?

625
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,070
Then what you mean is there's a next time?

626
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,040
Why are you so cute?

627
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,870
Look, your hair is a mess.

628
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,360
What's wrong? Are you mad?

629
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,180
Nothing

630
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,520
Are you mad because my younger brother brought Xin'er along?

631
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,870
You You and Zhao Lei are also here.

632
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,200
Then why do you look upset?

633
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,020
Are you on your period?

634
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,080
Anxin, the nail hasn't been nailed in.

635
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,680
You nail it then.

636
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,510
Moreover, nothing will happen if a nail is missing.

637
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,450
It's so strong. What's wrong?

638
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,220
I'll lay down for you to see.

639
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,950
- I'll try it out for you. Nothing at all. 
 - Come out.

640
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,310
- It's not strong enough. Come out. 
 - It's very strong.

641
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,750
- It's very strong. 
 - Hurry.

642
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,930
If you want to play, then lets try it together.

643
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,700
I don't want to try it with you.

644
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,090
I already told you that its not strong enough and not safe.

645
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,310
Safer than you.

646
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,560
My goodness.

647
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,870
Brother Yue, are you fine?

648
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,510
He's fine.

649
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,400
As long as you're fine. Be careful in the future.

650
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,680
He's so big and not made of paper. Of course he's fine, right, Ling Yue?

651
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,090
That's right. I'm fine.

652
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,810
He's fine.

653
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,600
Fan over here, You You. The oil is dripping.

654
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,480
Smells good. He already took them away.

655
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,200
Xin'er, I just grilled these. Give them a try.

656
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,540
Xiao Sheng, let's go take a walk.

657
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,900
Are you trying to go look for my second brother?

658
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,160
So, can I reject?

659
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,520
The meat is quite tender.

660
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:39,820
Smells good. Where's Anxin and President Ling?

661
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,660
Of course they're in their own world.

662
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,100
<i>Give it a try. I cooked them just for you.</i>

663
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,890
<i>Anxin, are you home?</i>

664
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,930
<i>I'll come look for you.</i>

665
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,800
<i>Brother, don't worry. I'm having fun with my friends.</i>

666
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,350
<i>Oh, don't stay up too late. Stay safe.</i>

667
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,090
Are we going down?

668
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,950
Be careful. Slowly.

669
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,310
Why is there a tent here?

670
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,860
Didn't you say you want to star gaze?

671
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,280
I set up a tent here so we can star gaze together.

672
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,790
You even remembered this? So thoughtful.

673
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,310
It seems like we can't see stars tonight.

674
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,740
But it took me so long to find this place.

675
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,370
Then let's look at them next time, okay?

676
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,200
I'm sorry that you couldn't see the stars.

677
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,780
There's nothing to be sorry about, silly.

678
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,500

♫ <i>Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you</i> ♫

697
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,280
♫ <i>Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more</i> ♫

698
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:42,180
♫ <i>Abandoning the token of happiness, for it has always been you</i> ♫
