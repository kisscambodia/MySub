00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,400
Hi, we meet again.

176
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,770
Hi.

177
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,000
Is this what they call

178
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,970
"If two are destined, they will meet across a thousand li."

179
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,640
Where do you live?

180
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,080
I live here.

181
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,230
I also am in the 28th building!

182
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,880
What a coincidence.

183
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,780
-Do you need any help? 
-Yeah!

184
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,970
Wait, would it be a hassle?

185
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,110
No, it wouldn't be.

186
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,910
 I was just waiting for you to say that, future husband. 

187
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,400
Let's go.

188
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,870
 With a face like that, it can kill anyone. 

189
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,970
 But he is very humble and warm. 

190
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,910
 He is sure my ideal type

191
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,610
Am I dreaming? 

192
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,400
Miss Youyou

193
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,730
You didn't select a floor, which floor do you live on?

194
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,960
I live on the 18th floor.

195
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
What a coincidence!

196
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,270
Do you also live on that floor?

197
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,610
I live in 1808.

198
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,030
Can you be-

199
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,490
You are the guest for today?

200
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,450
You are Anxin's brother?

201
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,720
I am Anxin's brother, Ansheng.

202
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,570
This is retribution, you know.

203
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,140
What kind of design is this?

204
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,550
There are dangers everywhere.

205
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,780
Who puts the spoon that high? What happens if you forget to close the cabinet, and it hurts you in the end?

206
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,780
It's you who's incompatible with this place. I have no issues.

207
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,900
It's all Gu Ansheng's fault.

208
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,520
Apologies.

209
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,070
Is this my house?

210
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,690
You are...

211
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,920
Miss Ai Li?

212
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,000
You are Xiao Ba's lover, Ai Li?

213
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,570
Who is Xiao Ba?

214
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,180
The cripple who lived in Anxin's house.

215
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,750
-There must be some misunderstanding- 
-See!

216
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,150
I knew it, the mistress main line!

217
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,310
I've seen it too many times in all the dramas I have watched.

218
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,170
I will repeat myself one more time.

219
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,350
If you continue to do this, then I will call the police.

220
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,810
The Ling Group's people like to go to other's home,

221
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,990
If that kind of news spreads, it wouldn't look too good on you guys.

222
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,640
You were the one who wasn't careful, why are you blaming my brother.

223
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Your button.

224
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,220
-I'll help you button it up. 
-I can do it myself.

225
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,100
-I'll help you. 
-I don't need you to help me.

226
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,480
-Anxin- 
-I don't need you to.

227
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,400
What are you doing-

228
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,940
Anxin, those types of things you need to go to the room.

229
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,240
No, brother, we were just-

230
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,390
Anxin, wait here for a second.

231
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,680
President Ling!

232
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,660
Let him hit me!

233
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,200
Brother!

234
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,530
Ling Yue!

235
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,080
Why didn't you block it?

236
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,070
Your rejection is worse than his punch.

237
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,140
President Ling.

238
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,350
Let's go.

239
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,830
Ansheng, your hand is injured!

240
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,180
Does it hurt?

241
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,470
It doesn't hurt.

242
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,480
I just hate that I didn't punch him harder.

243
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,410
FFFFFFFFFF

244
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,570
I saw everything, and you are still standing up for him.

245
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,760
-No, I- 
-Wait Anxin.

246
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,070
Isn't Xiao Ba's leg crippled?

247
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,530
How, what is this situation between you two?

248
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,820
I'm getting confused.

249
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,960
I will explain it to you later on.

250
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,690
Let me do it, I learned first aid.

251
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,480
Brother no matter what hitting someone is wrong.

252
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,120
He bullied you so do you want me to stand there and watch?

253
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,770
Okay, don't let me see him ever again.

254
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,120
I am against you two being together.

255
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,250
I already explained to you that it was a misunderstanding.

256
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,450
- It was because my collar... 
 - Actually, I don't think this can be called bullying.

257
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,070
They both mutually like each other.

258
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,680
It's just a couple's flirty banter.

259
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,960
-We aren't a couple! 
-They aren't a couple!

260
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,730
Be careful.

261
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,880
Who told you two not to listen to me.

262
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,220
You had to go find her.

263
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,480
What a good place we're in now. Not only did she not appreciate your kindness,

264
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,520
And you came back injured.

265
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,020
It wasn't completely without gain.

266
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,970
At least it's a good start.

267
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,240
See, his brain is broken.

268
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,560
President Ling, this time Miss Anxin

269
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,760
should have forgiven you.

270
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,410
What are you two whispering behind my back? Are you having a secret meeting?

271
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,130
It-t hurts!

272
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,150
If I have a fracture, no one will put on medicine for President Ling.

273
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,150
I can put on medicine myself.

274
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,760
At a time like this, if you're not going to help me, at least don't support her.

275
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,610
It' hurts!

276
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,010
But I need you to help me somewhere else.

277
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,840
I can't get up, help me.

278
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,460
The hands of someone who practices martial arts are quite soft.

279
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,160
If you do this again next time, you are dead!

280
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't dare to!

281
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,770
No way! That is too exciting!

282
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,500
I announce from today on,

283
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,380
I am not a supporter of you two.

284
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,880
I am a hater of Xiao Ba.

285
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,930
Isn't he deceiving your feelings? He's a total jerk.

286
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,360
He is actually not a jerk.

287
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,280
Forget it, let's not talk about him.

288
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,790
But don't be too upset.

289
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,920
There's no man that my pretty little sister Gu Anxin can't get.

290
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,280
You're just letting go of a little sapling

291
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,090
in order to win a big forest.

292
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,650
Don't worry. You can choose any good man you want.

293
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,560
You're indulging me for no reason.

294
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,170
I feel like you have something you want me to help you in.

295
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,560
It's nothing.

296
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,800
Can you help me see

297
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,590
if your brother

298
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,030
Wow! Xu Youyou.

299
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,770
You want to be my sister-in-law?

300
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,820
I'm shy!

301
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,120
Don't worry, leave it to me.

302
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,340
Don't let your own fertile water flow into someone else's field, understand?

303
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,410
Thank you for your great kindness.

304
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,560
Don't! I'm going to throw up!

305
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,450
I'm going to hang up!

306
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,390
[Are you already sleeping?]

307
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,110
[What's up?]

308
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,170
[How can I help you?]

309
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,890
[I'm sleeping.]

310
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,660
Is there no signal?

311
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,080
Are you sleeping?

312
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,490
What is it, Brother?

313
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,990
If you haven't slept yet, then drink some milk.

314
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,780
Come on in.

315
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,730
Thank you, Brother.

316
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,270
Brother,

317
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,640
are you dating?

318
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
Why are you asking me this suddenly?

319
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,040
Have you dated?

320
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm so...stiff

321
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,090
there probably aren't any girls who want to date me.

322
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,500
That's not right. I remember when you started university

323
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,590
every time you came home your backpack was filled with love letters.

324
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,540
What do you think of You You?

325
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,450
She's quite energetic.

326
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,830
But don't you think about doing anything.

327
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,350
- You're shy.
- No I'm not.

328
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,910
Ah you're shy! Look at you.

329
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,090
You're embarrassed, look!

330
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,730
Don't joke around.

331
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,960
I'm hungry...

332
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,720
Work didn't wake me up this morning,

333
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,020
it was breakfast.

334
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,700
You're up.

335
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,590
Why did you wear so little coming out aren't you cold?

336
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,280
It's hot today.

337
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,700
That's not good. What if you catch a cold.

338
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,840
Go wear some pants.

339
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,910
Go, listen to me.

340
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,290
Thanks for yor help.

341
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,850
Wait a moment.

342
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,790
Help me pass along a message. It's cooled down lately

343
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,270
Also Wear more clothing. Don't catch a cold.

344
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,160
And also, this breakfast is just for her,

345
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,780
not for the person named Gu Ansheng.

346
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,180
Remember, Gu Ansheng.

347
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,600
Gu Ansheng. Got it.

348
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,940
Hey, move over.

349
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,980
You don't even know how to flirt.

350
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,950
Let me tell you. Say this later.

351
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,090
Coming!

352
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,650
- Xiao Wang!
- Sister Anxin!

353
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,040
You moved so quickly.

354
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,730
This is the breakfast that Mr. Ling sent you.

355
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,250
Umm...just tell him that I already ate breakfast today.

356
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,800
Go ahead and give it back to him.

357
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Ah, Sister Anxin, if you do this I'll be fired.

358
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,200
Lingyue, you dare blackmail me.

359
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,210
Ah then give it to me.

360
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,210
Why don't you stay and eat breakfast before you go?

361
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,150
No no no no.

362
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,580
My client has a message to give too.

363
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,220
Anxin, the weather outside is cold.

364
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,910
Remember to wear a coat when you go out.

365
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,230
Also, I know you're still mad at me.

366
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,110
That's why I have been good to keep away.

367
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,760
But please receive the heart I've put into

368
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,570
the breakfast I made for you.

369
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,650
Remember, you must eat all of it.

370
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,380
Don't give any to unimportant people. Good morning.

371
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,820
I love you more today than I did yesterday.

372
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,500
This is what Ling Yue said?

373
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,340
Yes.

374
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,870
I got it. I'll see you at work.

375
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,840
Love you.

376
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,020
You scared me.

377
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,000
Brother!

378
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,900
That's too...wasteful.

379
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,440
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

380
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,130
Don't worry about him.

Hi sisters! What kind of small meeting are you in?

383
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,510
Come quick. I'll tell you a huge secret.

384
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,440
- Ai Li and President Ling are together! 
 - Ai Li and President Ling are together?!

385
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,840
Talk softly.

386
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,380
They're keeping a low profile relationship.

387
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,940
If you leak the news that'll be bad.

388
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,200
When did this happen?

389
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Why so suddenly?

390
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,740
How is that sudden?

391
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,020
This morning when I went to report on my work,

392
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,430
President Ling suddenly stopped Ai Li.

393
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,930
Wait a moment.

394
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,100
Was the breakfast eaten?

395
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,520
Yes.

396
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,000
That's all.

397
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,030
You may go first. I have some business with Ai Li.

398
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,750
Alright.

399
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,320
Such a shame.

400
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,480
I didn't even get a chance.

401
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,690
Stop your mouth!

402
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,880
President Ling, I'll wait for you outside.

403
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,340
Okay.

404
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,830
It's good that you came.

405
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,040
I have to go on a business trip for a few days—

406
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,180
When I go to my business trip help me with

407
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,330
the plan we discussed to make Anxin happy.

408
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

409
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,570
You-you going on the business trip,

410
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,360
Is it with Ai Li?

411
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,820
Yes.

412
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,100
Then everything is true?

413
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,880
Otherwise it's fake?

414
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,520
Then you tell me,

415
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,970
it's fake that you like Anxin, isn't it?

416
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,490
Of course it's real.

417
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,430
What are you trying to say?

418
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,040
Honestly tell me,

419
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,460
you...haven't thought about...with Ai Li...

420
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,170
do something...since she is quite pretty after all.

421
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,210
Don't you like her?

422
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,950
How did you know? Does Ai Li know?

423
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,770
I don't have time to fool around with you.

424
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm going. Don't forget our plans.

425
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,610

426
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,790

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,970
Look!

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,430
Anxin! You're finally here.

430
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,390
We've been jealous all morning.

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,310
Come quickly, look!

First Batman, right?

434
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,450
We're meeting so quickly.

435
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,870
What a coincidence.

436
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,130
Alright, come on in first.

437
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,140
I just need to get this package to you here. I'm leaving.

438
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,150
This is the service attitude from your company?

439
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,750
Isn't it no bad reviews?

440
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,380
Is it time for me to add some bad reviews?

441
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,430
Client, is there something you need?

442
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,180
Yes.

Here, come on in.

444
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,100
How is it? Surprised?

445
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,120
That was quite scary. You—

446
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,810
Don't be worried.

447
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,900

449
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,040
This wine is too expensive, I don't want to drink it.

450
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,980
Expensive, then have some cake.

451
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,720
Can I not eat?

452
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,300
What do you think?

453
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,720
What... what does this mean?

454
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,290
It's a gift for you.

455
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,800
It's a gift for me? You shoved it into the cake?

456
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,120
What if I broke my teeth on it? I don't have the money to get fake teeth.

457
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,100
Director Ling, what exactly is it that you want?

458
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,680
I just want to sit and have a nice conversation with you.

00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,330
Is that okay?

460
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,750
Did you receive what I sent? Do you like it?

461
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,710
You sent me those bags?

462
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,340
I like giving pretty girls like you

463
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,860
little things like that.

464
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,720
That's true. Only you would like that yellow color

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
which looks like poo.

466
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,820

- which looks like poo. 
 - Hey!

00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,910
Fine. It looks like you still don't know what you want.

- So I only have to sign. 
 - Yeah.

 - Exactly.

 - Right.

You're sending me bags, a car, and a house.

What are you trying to do?

483
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,250
Then what do you like? Whatever you like, I can...

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,220
I just like money.

485
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,850

I couldn't tell from looking at you.

- Fine, then I'll— 
 - One good review.

Anxin, why do you keep rejecting me?

495
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,110
- I'm sincere— 
 - You're sincerely trying to make things difficult for me.

496
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,800
Since you're so unwilling to give me a good review,

497
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,080
then you can do whatever you want.

498
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,870
Didn't you say you wanted me to be satisfied?

499
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,590
Yes.

500
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,050
You've already sent me so many gifts.

501
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,050
It's only right that I give you a gift.

502
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,710
- What gift? 
 - Perfume.

503
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,960
What perfume?

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,730
What did you spray?

00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,300
How is Six God? 
 (a mosquito repellent)

506
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,150
I also took a suggestion to add some Sichuan hot pepper. Is it refreshing?

507
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,100
I won't go blind, will I?

508
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,390
It won't go so far as to make you blind.

509
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,420
Instead of wailing here, you'd be better off going to wash your eyes.

I still haven't managed to get a good review. I've held everyone back.

523
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,600
How about this? You can deduct my pay.

524
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,950
That way I can feel more at ease.

525
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,660
Anxin, you have already achieved a perfect five-star review.

The customer specially made a phone call thanking you for sending his things to him just in time.

527
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,770
That guy seems pretty perverted, but his heart isn't bad.

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,350
- Anxin? 
 - Please, go on.

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,150
Everyone, come over!

530
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,510
Here, this is for you.

531
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,540
Anxin, even though you will soon leave Express Delivery Service,

532
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,180
I ask that you remember

533
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,960
we will always be your colleagues!

534
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,730
- That's right! 
 - Yes!

535
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,760
How has Anxin been recently?

536
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Miss Anxin has already quit her job at Express Delivery Service.

537
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,280
Oh right, President Ling, recently Director Ling Fang has been rather active.

538
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,770
Don't worry about him. Let him do as he pleases.

539
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,680
It's not work-related. Recently, he keeps hanging around Miss Anxin.

540
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,330
- Make a U-turn. 
 - Okay.

541
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,030
Anxin.

542
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,510
We're really brought together by fate.

543
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,870
- Do you need something? 
 - I was in the wrong that day. I'm here to apologize.

544
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,670
This is a gift I prepared for you as a token of my regard.

545
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,180
Director Ling, we aren't friends just because you left a good review. Do you understand that?

546
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,990
We may not be friends today, but that doesn't mean we won't be tomorrow.

547
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,370
Plus, there's the day after tomorrow, and the day after that.

548
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,170
The bags and other strange things you gave me,

549
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,330
I sent them all back to you. You should have received them.

550
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,640
Don't do these things in the future. It's really childish.

551
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,790
How come I just can't seem to do it?

552
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,130
- You can't do it? 
 - Hey, hey.

553
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,970
I'm just giving you a gift to express my apology.

554
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,440
If you don't want it, throw it away.

555
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,670
Sorry about that, I didn't—

556
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,190
My heart is beating so fast it'll explode.

557
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,910
I'm going to throw up, you're disgusting.

558
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,880
Let her go!

559
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,090
Couldn't you see that Anxin and I were being intimate? Why are you running over to be a third wheel?

560
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,770
Who's being intimate with you?

561
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,550
Did you forget Six God?

562
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,310
Look, she's even concerned for me.

563
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,430
Elder Brother, is it here that hurts?

564
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,310
Or here?

565
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,980
No, no, wait.

566
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,330
It doesn't hurt.

567
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,250
- It doesn't hurt, does it? 
 - No, it doesn't hurt.

568
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,520
That's good then. I'll go now.

569
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,890
What about you?

570
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,800
Second Brother, your leg just got healed. Take care of yourself.

571
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,670
Are you hurt?

572
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,860
Let's go.

573
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,430
Are you okay?

574
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,590
You can first go to the briefing by yourself.

575
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,170
Alright.

576
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,780
When did she get so close to Ling Fang?

577
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,800
Could it be that something happened in the two days I was on my business trip?

578
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,880
My wrist hurts and he doesn't even show any concern.

579
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,660
- If you don't drive, I'll get off the car. 
 - Wait.

580
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,830
Q-Qiuhong Garden, thank you.

581
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,470
Then I'll go now.

582
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,660
What's wrong?

583
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:20,680
