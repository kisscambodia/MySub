33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,810
What's wrong? It's so late and you're still not asleep.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,590
I can't fall asleep.

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,760
Would you like to drink a glass together?

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,010
Okay.

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,530
Someone gave me 10 bottles of wine.

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,510
Every year

39
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,630
and each flavor

40
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,350
are different.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,750
Are you talking about Ling Sheng?

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,260
Brother,

43
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,280
what kind of person do think Ling Sheng is?

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,770
Ling Sheng seems to have always been well protected by his family.

45
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,660
He's an outgoing person.

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,250
Even though I don't like the people from the Ling family,

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,120
but Ling Sheng is indeed different from the others in the Ling family.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,830
What's more important is that he's been serious about you all these years.

49
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
I know,

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,160
but I'm very confused right now.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,310
I have no way

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,770
to completely let go of Ling Yue.

53
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,660
Xin'er,

54
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,610
ever relationship has its overdraft.

55
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,820
If the overdraft is empty,

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,160
then there's no need to continue.

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,790
If its weren't for other people appearing,

58
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,680
my relationship with him wouldn't be like what it is now.

59
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,260
I want to test it one more time

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
and for the last time.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,660
It's Ling Yue.

62
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,300
Hello.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,860
Okay, let's meet after the celebration then.

64
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,600
Ling Yue wants to meet you?

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
For what?

66
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,200
I don't know. Who knows what he's up to.

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,980
Brother, can you help me go to the wine rack to get me another bottle?

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,670
Okay, I'll drink with you until you're satisfied tonight.

69
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,440
Wait for me.

70
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,650
<i>Let's arrive before 11 o' clock tomorrow.</i>

71
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,520
<i>Let's meet at the small auditorium near the east corner of the school.</i>

72
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,950
I didn't expect this place to be abandoned.

73
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,040
Is it just like our memories?

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,520
They're being all thrown away by you.

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,450
Why is it you? Where's Gu Ansheng?

76
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,300
My brother didn't come.

77
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,210
You kept avoiding me and not seeing me.

78
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,280
I can only use this method to invite you over.

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,300
I came to find Gu Ansheng regarding the collaboration. If there's nothing else, then I'll get going.

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,890
Why do you always avoid me each time you see me?

81
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,680
Do I look that scary?

82
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,430
Our time is very precious.

83
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,000
- Stop doing things that are meaningless. 
 - I know,

84
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,150
but this is the last time.

85
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,660
Let me finish what I want to say, what I couldn't say, and what I didn't have time to say.

86
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,020
Can I?

87
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,530
I locked all the doors.

88
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,220
I also blocked all the signals.

89
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,720
- What on earth do you want to do? 
 - I want to make you stay.

90
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,520
I want you to reconsider and think it through.

91
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Who on earth is your right decision?

92
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,440
You're wasting time.

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,560
Compared to the future,

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,820
this time that is wasted is considered nothing.

95
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,800
When revisiting here,

96
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,030
is there a different feeling?

97
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,800
I know your relationship is sweet now,

98
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,030
but I'm really not willing to believe it and give up

99
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,010
that the person you chose at the end is her.

100
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,200
What decision I made

101
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,430
is my business.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,870
Brother Yue, we grew up together.

103
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,210
We didn't need to waste 20 years to understand and know each other.

104
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,330
How can you confirm that within such short period of time,

105
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,980
your decision won't be wrong?

106
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,840
As long as its Anxin, then it won't be wrong.

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
If you want to keep talking about this to me,

108
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,190
then it's unnecessary to continue.

109
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,680
Since I was young,

110
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,570
even once or even a moment,

111
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,470
were you not moved?

112
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,410
We knew each other for so long.

113
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,680
<i>You were always someone worth respecting</i>

114
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,780
and a friend that I was close with.

115
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,610
That's it.

116
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,600
It's been 10 years.

117
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,910
I liked you for 10 years.

118
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,020
Our relationship for so many years

119
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,900
cannot be compared to a few months with her.

120
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,910
Since I chose Anxin,

121
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,190
then I won't like anyone else.

122
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,020
Stop being entangled with something that won't have a result.

123
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,180
President Ling is not back yet?

124
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,700
President Ling did not come to work yet. Theres already few important phone calls for him

125
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
but we could not contact him

126
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,470
Hello?

127
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,870
Miss Anxin, do you know where President Ling is?

128
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,110
How would I know where he is?

129
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,090
We can't find President Ling at the company

130
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,470
everyone is extremely worried

131
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,250
when I woke up this morning he had already left

132
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,540
So he didn't tell you where he was going?

133
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,590
No

134
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,730
He told us he needed to clear something about you

135
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,710
About me?

136
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,860
let me see if I can reach him

137
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,730
Wait a moment.

138
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,290
<i>[Ling Yue]</i>

139
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,790

<i>Please try again later.</i>

141
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,500
The opening event Invitation...

142
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,220
I know where he is!

143
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,720
'man stalking'

144
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,520

Lingyue

146
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,440
Anxinou

147
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,000
You're okay! You scared me

148
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,730
You're not angry at me anymore?

149
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,910
You did this on purpose

150
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,580
I'm sorry I made you worry

151
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,840
It was you using my brothers name to meet Lingyue

152
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,000
your brother?

153
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,870
He's my brother!

154
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,590
Gu Anxin.

155
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,950
You really like what's mine

156
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,030
I have no interest at all in what's yours.

157
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,590
what do you want?

158
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
What I want?

159
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,830
what Ling Yue has done to me in the past?

160
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,920
I don't want to know.

161
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,630
We...

162
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,920
have a past

163
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,500
that no one can replace.

164
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,270
do you want to know?

165
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,110
I don't want to hear it

166
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,880
Fine

167
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,440
Then you can see it

168
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,480
What can it prove?

169
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,770
Your relationship is great but...

170
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,130
Gu Anxin did you ever think about

171
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,450
what right do you have to love him? you already ruined Yuguo's life

172
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,800
Now you want to ruin mine? 10 years.

173
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,290
I waited for him for 10 years! What did you do for him?

174
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,320
All you are just average standing

175
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,580
Couldn't even finish college

176
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,370
I finally realized my patience and holding back

177
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,310
only makes you more eager.

178
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,740
Gu Xiner, let me just say. I did nothing wrong

179
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,030
from now on...

180
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,590
I am no longer going to get bullied

181
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,890
and hold my patience

182
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,760
I will live properly

183
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,250
to love Lingyue properly

184
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,590
So please live your own life properly

185
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,100
Let's go

186
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,800
10 years!

187
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,000
My 10 years is nothing compared to her few months?

188
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
Somethings are not how you see them.

189
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,980
It isn't just a sudden love?

190
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,450
No, we are not.

191
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,200
As with you...

192
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
it is only like that picture

193
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,990
a misunderstanding

194
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,460
Lingyue and Anxin has left

195
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,800
I knew you would find me

196
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,070
Then that picture...

197
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,660
that was just a prank by Lingfang

198
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,070
then if I see another picture like that

199
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,060
you're dead to me

200
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,130
I promise there won't be a next time

201
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,170
how can you smile?  you were almost kidnapped

202
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,820
I was just smiling at you claiming me

203
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,390
That's right. I've already made a vow of sovereingty.

204
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,440
then this life you are mine

205
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,250
then you can't be shared with anyone else

206
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,290
and in your heart you can only hold me

207
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,410
that so?

208
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,820
Ok! Got it

209
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,820
Xiner...

210
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,580
you don't look so well, are you alright

211
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,450
Why are you here?

212
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,470
Didn't you say you don't care anymore?

213
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,930
I wasn't''t honest

214
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,730
When I heard about you I started to worry again

215
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,320
So I came without a second thought

216
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,550
That night...

217
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,330
That night nothing happened. I asked a female worker at the hotel to change your clothes.

218
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,650
That night you were drunk

219
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,190
How could I?

220
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,280
I know you don't love me.

221
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,250
Then why did you leave?

222
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,190
I was just frustrated at the way you hurt yourself

223
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,310
just like now

224
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,810
you already know he doesn't have feelings for you

225
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,790
yet you won't give up and continue to struggle

226
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,620
you already waited 10 years, will you continue to wait?

227
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,150
how many 10 years would you have?

228
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,980
is it worth it?

229
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,940
actually, before you came

230
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,060
I was still hateful

231
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,220
and blaming

232
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,660
and did not want to quit

233
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,480
but when you showed up

234
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,310
I suddenly don't feel that way anymore

235
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,810
I said it inside my heart.

236
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,710
Thank you, Ling Sheng.

237
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,900
No matter what state I'm in, you're willing to keep me company.

238
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,360
I promise you. This time

239
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,610
I will definitely let go.

240
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,450
Let's go.

241
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,070
Okay.

242
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,990
Come on. I'll carry you.

243
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,110
That is what happened.

244
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,490
Regarding Yu Guo's issue, Yang Hong is the most suspicious.

245
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh right. Why did you look for my brother?

246
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,300
For a collaboration.

247
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,460
It was always my uneasiness that got me.

248
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,790
I always feel like he was our barrier

249
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,870
so I wanted to kick him away,

250
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,530
but it won't bring me anything even if I do.

251
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,250
It happens to be the opposite.

252
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,580
When he was destroying the people and things I loved,

253
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,370
no matter if it was you or Ling Group

254
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,410
I always thought I should use another method to protect the people and things I love.

255
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,680
Regarding your uneasiness,

256
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,860
I can understand.

257
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,190
You're still the Ling Yue that I love.

258
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,430
So you mean

259
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,740
you don't love me when we argue?

260
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,800
But I don't like you less when we argue.

261
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,500
I don't know who it was

262
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
that didn't say anything and kept it inside.

263
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,370
What's wrong?

264
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,250
<i>I finally contacted you. Are you fine?</i>

265
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,680
I'm fine. I'm with Anxin.

266
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,790
Your dad suddenly had a stroke and was rushed to the hospital. Hurry and come over.

267
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,550
- Great Auntie. 
 - Auntie.

268
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,340
- What's that situation now? 
 - The surgery is in progress and the doctor didn't say anything.

269
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,260
Dad was fine. How come he suddenly fainted?

270
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,120
<i>How is he fine?</i>

271
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
Your dad is so busy with work.

272
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,350
He haven't taken a break for half a year.

273
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,860
Who was by his side when his illness acted up?

274
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,110
I was by dad's side.

275
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,620
Dad was in the studyroom. He was fine,

276
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,330
but then he suddenly said he was dizzy. I thought something was wrong

277
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,200
so I immediately called emergency.

278
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,810
When the ambulance arrived, he already fainted.

279
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,700
How long was the time period from when he fainted until he reached the hospital?

280
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,720
Doctor! Doctor!

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,040
He patient's condition stable right now, but he still needs to be observed.

282
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,890
When we ask, everyone says stable. He's not awake. What do you mean by stable?

283
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,020
It indicates that he's stable. It requires time for him to gain consciousness.

284
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,130
Doctor, there's so many documents waiting for President Ling to sign.

285
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,960
<i>Can you use better medicine</i>

286
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,310
<i>so that President Ling can gain consciousness earlier?</i>

287
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,980
Is the patient's health more important or signing the documents?

288
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,250
All the brothers are here.

289
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,120
Is there no one else in the Ling family?

290
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,850
Find us if there's anything.

291
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,270
I'll get going.

292
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,600
You've worked hard.

293
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,820
Regarding work,

294
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,770
let's talk after your dad wakes up.

295
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,110
I think before President Ling wakes up,

296
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,240
letting Ling Fang handle it

297
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,910
is more suitable since he's the oldest one.

298
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,790
This isn't suitable.

299
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,310
<i>How is it not?</i>

300
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,970
The company has to have someone in charge.

301
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,980
No, after hearing President Ling was unconscious,

302
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,750
the shareholders discussed and decided to call a lawyer over.

303
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,290
Why did you guys notify a lawyer for?

304
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,410
Everyone this is Mr. Ling's signature

305
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,510
for his emergency letter and his will.

306
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,280
President Ling is unconscious right now so its considered an emergency.

307
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,640
According to this document,

308
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,410
Mr. Ling Yue will be temporarily in charge of Ling Group.

309
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,620
President Ling, since this is Old President Ling's meaning,

310
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,340
then I'll have to trouble you to go back to the company with us.

311
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,870
There are a lot of things that you need to go back and handle.

312
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,280
President Ling Yue, if its not taken care in time and the information gets leaked,

313
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,870
it will affect the company and the stocks.

314
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,620
President Ling Yue.

315
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,280
Go ahead, I'm here. Don't worry.

316
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,860
Okay, I'll leave him to you guys.

317
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,040
Tell me immediately when dad wakes up and I'll come over.

318
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,970
Take care.

319
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,680
Why are you looking for me?

320
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,600
I want to remind my old friend.

321
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,250
I already know what you want to say

322
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,420
so you don't have to look for me in the future.

323
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,740
What about what happened in the past?

324
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,030
Don't worry.

325
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,490
This is already buried deeply.

326
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,220
Ling Yue.

327
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,750
Ling Yue.

328
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,830
Ling Yue.

329
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,480
What's wrong?

330
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,890
Why are you sweating so much?

331
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,050
Did you have a nightmare?

332
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,090
I'll bring you out for a walk, okay?

333
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,940
Here.

334
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,890
How is it? Are they cute?

335
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,100
There are more downstairs. Let's go take a look.

336
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,790
Let's go.

337
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,870
There are sharks downstairs.

338
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,380
What are you guys doing? Can't you guys see that this area is on maintenance?

339
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,100
We already brought tickets.

340
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,340
You still can't go in even if you guys brought tickets. Come next month.

341
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,870
You guys can't go in.

342
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,410
Let's go.

343
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,920
What are you doing?

344
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,990
Hug. Hug me.

345
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,250
Come in.

346
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,890
Welcome to the world of bad kids. Let's go!

347
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,620
<i>Who is it?</i>

348
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,260
That's odd.

349
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,300
Do you know why I brought you here today?

350
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,360
Your feud with my brother reminded me

351
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,770
that we are kids that were once hurt.

352
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,390
Even though wounds will heal,

353
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,830
but scars won't come off.

354
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,840
But

355
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
as long as we don't let our fears get at us,

356
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,690
then memories cannot swallow us.

357
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,250
Just like today. We neglected the risks

358
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,400
so you can appreciate what's happening now, right?

359
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,010
I always wanted to get rid of the dangers that the environment brings me,

360
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,660
but I neglected the biggest uneasiness in my heart.

361
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,650
Anxin, thank you

362
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,960
for letting me experience

363
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,920
how each situation comes from one's decision.

364
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,580
What I need isn't a fence,

365
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,750
but to walk out of the safe area.

366
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,310
Don't worry, you can do it.

367
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,570
I will always keep you company.

368
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,240
I'll have trouble you then.

369
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,450
Stingrays! Hurry, its string rays!

370
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,480
Wishes will come true if you make a wish in front of stringrays.

371
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,580
- Is there really such a thing? 
 - Yes, I just came up with it.

372
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,170
President Gu, President Ling is here.

373
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,630
What's up? Are you hear to declare war

374
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,400
or to take account of past affairs?

375
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,080
None.

376
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,070
I'm here to talk about a collaboration.

377
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,550
President Ling,

378
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,060
why are you suddenly collaborating with your enemy?

379
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,250
If its because of Anxin,

380
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,950
then I don't think its necessary.

381
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,890
<i>I don't want her to get involved with our issues.</i>

382
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,110
I won't make her be in a hard position.

383
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,810
It's Anxin who let me understand the meaning acceptance.

384
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,670
Fighting alone for temporarily benefits

385
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,350
won't last long.

386
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,700
I hope you can understand this.

387
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,360
Are you still the

388
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,680
Ling Yue who is decisive and stops at nothing?

389
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,990
Because I have yearning

390
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,170
so I became more frank.

391
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,620
Then why are you so confident that I'll definitely collaborate with you?

392
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,960
This is your best choice now.

393
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,130
Also, I trust Anxin and to be relatives with you to work together.

394
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Shaking hands in the past

395
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,990
tells the other party that they don't have any weapons in their hands.

396
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,650
Expanding your hand out now

397
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,550
means

398
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,680
we don't want to harm anyone.

399
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,160
I valued the prospects when I wanted to add in 5G.

400
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,420
I didn't want to compete with you on purpose.

401
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,430
It's just that after doing it..

402
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,330
deviated.

403
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,410
What you mean is you didn't know beforehand?

404
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,760
President Liu didn't tell us that he was collaborating with you guys.

405
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,800
Can you still contact President Liu now?

406
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,410
I can't. After something happened to the Gu Group, we couldn't contact him.

407
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,990
Ling Sheng,

408
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,660
didn't we say that you'll arrive in front of me at 10 o' clock sharp?

409
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,250
It's almost time. Where are you?

410
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,030
I already arrived.

411
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,000
Where are you then?

412
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,740
Walk towards the balcony and take a look.

413
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,690
Walk towards the balcony?

414
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,210
What are you up to? So mysterious.

415
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,940
Where are you?

416
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,570
Open it and take a look.

417
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,460
Where are you?

418
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,090
<i>Behind you.</i>

419
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,750
This is...

420
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,670
Xin'er,

421
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,050
do you still remember this?

422
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,720
This is the first gift that you gave me.

423
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,070
Even though I know this was originally for my second brother,

424
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,130
but was reluctant to even wear it once.

425
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm sorry. Regarding this, I actually...

426
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,650
There's no need to explain. I understand,

427
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,820
but there's something that you probably never knew.

428
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,650
When you went abroad to look for my second brother,

429
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,160
I would secretly go look for you quite often.

430
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,670
Even though you never noticed me each time

431
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,340
and we would brush pass each other,

432
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,350
but as long as I can see you each time,

433
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,800
I always feel really satisfied.

434
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,350
I went to all the cities that you went to.

435
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,750
I started to slowly collect these tickets and postcards.

436
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,520
I already collected so many without realizing.

437
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,450
How come you never told me this before?

438
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,750
You never told my second brother everything you did for him.

439
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,660
Xin'er, we're the same people.

440
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,810
We were too silly when we loved others.

441
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,390
I'm telling you this now just to let you know

442
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,970
when you secretly look at my second brother, there's also another person

443
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,220
secretly protecting you.

444
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,210
You don't have to love others so tiredly.

445
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,360
<i>You deserve to be loved and cherished too.</i>

446
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,070
Ling Sheng.

447
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,790
Xin'er,

448
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,310
when second brother would look for you in the past

449
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,750
and when you step in

450
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,810
without hesitation,

451
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,750
you'll run the rest of the path for him.

452
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,880
<i>But do you know?</i>

453
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,700
As long as you nod,

454
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,230
without hesitation, I can also

455
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,370
run crazily for you

456
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,850
so are you willing to accept

457
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,250
the me, who is willing to run crazily for you?

458
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,620
Thank you.

459
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,960
I love you.

460
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,230
<i>The patient has a nose contusion. Routine blood test for blood clotting,</i>

461
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,910
<i>STD screening, kidney function, electroylytes, etc.</i>

462
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,270
<i>Gu Anxin?</i>

463
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,370
<i>I seem to have no impression of her.</i>

464
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,990
<i>I can guarantee that no one will know.</i>

465
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,220
<i>Don't let there be a next time.</i>

466
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,930
<i>Teacher Shen.</i>

467
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,560
Teacher Shen?

468
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,380
I already looked at the report. It's quite well written.

469
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,490
Near the end, regarding the patient being discharged and their basic medication needs,

470
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,710
there needs to be some specific and reasonable

471
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,390
physiological

472
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,600
and daily life recommendations for the patient.

473
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,590
I know now, Teacher Shen.

474
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,350
Thank you for instructing me during this time.

475
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,290
Let me ask you a question.

476
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,050
Why are you being a doctor?

477
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,720
I never had any ambitions since I was young,

478
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,450
but I feel like being able to relieve pain and save lives

479
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,090
is great thing to do.

480
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,370
If this can become my career,

481
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,890
then I think

482
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,530
my life would be more meaningful.

483
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,320
President Ling, Jack and them should be at the airport now.

484
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,630
They will reach the meeting location in about 30 minutes.

485
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,870
<i>Bro, I feel so bad.</i>

486
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,100
What's wrong?

487
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,520
<i>I don't want to continue staying here. I want to resign!</i>

488
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,940
Can you be more rational? Where are you now?

489
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,680
<i>I'm not good. I cannot be rational!</i>

490
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,110
Shen Yishan?

491
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,570
Hello?

492
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,240
Turn around and go to Shen Yishan's house.

493
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,100
Bro, you're here.

494
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,000
Drink with me.

495
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,710
Ai Li? I was must dreaming.

496
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,200
Dreams are wonderful. Even Ai Li is here.

497
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,200
Then, why did you come in my dreams?

498
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,300
You value your lover more than your friends. Looks like you're not drunk.

499
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,200
You don't know how bad I feel.

500
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
I won't ever go to the hospital again.

501
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,550
Starting tomorrow, I will accompany Ai Li

502
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,000
to wonderland.

503
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,200
I rarely see him like this. Just let him open up for once.

504
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,460
Hello?

505
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,580
President Ling, Jack already arrived.

506
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,000
We must depart now.

507
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,800
I'll go over there. Keep him company.

508
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
- But— 
 - He needs you right now.

509
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,600
Moreover, you've worked hard recently. Treat it like a break for yourself.

510
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,000
Old Jiang, oh Old Jiang. Teacher Jiang.

511
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,200
Why did you do such a thing?

512
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,800
Why?

513
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,200
Is it because of Jiang Tao? Is it necessary?

514
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,500
You don't know how important he is to me.

515
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,540
He's my mentor.

516
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Since you feel so bad and he's so close to you,

517
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,400
why aren't you reminded him to take responsibility?

518
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Do you know how many people he saved?

519
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,800
Do you know he's the hope of many people?

520
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,400
If it was me who sent him to jail,

521
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,800
then how should I face him?

522
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,000
But you'll only hurt Anxin and them by avoiding the problem.

523
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,400
Moreover, you and your mentor will suffer just as much.

524
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,400
Aren't closest people all like this?

525
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,600
It's hard to say it and face it.

526
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,400
Just like you. You always avoiding my pursuing.

527
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,100
Look! Why?

528
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,400
Why?

529
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,800
Stop being like this. You can't solve the problem by acting like this.

530
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,700
But at least I can relieve the pain.

531
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,200
Ai Li,

532
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,100
you're a robot.

533
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,800
Only I, Xiao Yi Shan,

534
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,600
understand why you're single.

535
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,600
♪ The gust of wind blows pass my heart ♪

536
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,000
Stop singing and go to sleep.

537
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,200
♪ It won't ever cry for me ♪

538
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Stop singing and go to sleep.

539
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,000
L-let go, Xiao Yi Shan.

540
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,600
I'm not letting go.

541
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,400
I want to keep hugging you until forever.

542
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
- Let go first. 
 - I'm not letting go.

543
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
You'll fly away once I let go.

544
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,400
I know you probably don't like me that much,

545
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,600
but can you give me a chance to like you?

546
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,200
L-let go first.

547
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm not letting go unless you promise me.

548
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,000
Promise you what?

549
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,400
Promise...

550
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,230
to let us be together.

551
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,800
Say it.

552
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,900
Okay, I promise you.

553
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
President Ling said you had no food at home so he told me to bring breakfast for you.

554
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,170
It's all my favorites. Thank you.

555
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Thank you, Ling Yue too.

556
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Hurry and eat, then go to work.

557
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,000
Go to work? I'm not going.

558
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,800
I'm going to turn in my resign letter today.

559
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,600
I'm not working anymore. I'm resigning.

560
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,000
President Ling said he's not allowing you to resign.

561
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,600
Based on what?

562
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,800
He's not my superior. I can do whatever I want.

563
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,300
Then, what if I don't want you to resign?

564
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,400
What?

565
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,200
Y-you're also not my superior.

566
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,600
What am I to you then?

567
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,500
Good friend.

568
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,800
That's right, good friend.

569
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,700
You don't know that I have people that I don't want to see at the hospital.

570
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,700
<i>I feel bad if I see him.</i>

571
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,400
I know.

572
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
You know? How did you know?

573
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,000
You said it yesterday.

574
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,700
Yesterday?

575
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,800
Yesterday, you were the one who took care of me?

576
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,600
Who else then?

577
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,800
I didn't say anything I wasn't supposed to, right?

578
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to do, right?

579
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,000
I also dreamed that I hugged you.

580
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Yes, in your dreams.

581
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's good that its my dreams.

582
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,700
Xiao Ai is getting her vaccine today. Let's go together.

583
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,200
How come women change their faces so quickly? Why is she angry?
