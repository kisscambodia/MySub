22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,290
I thought about it a lot these past few days.

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,880
I shouldn't have interfered with your issues. I forgot to think about how you felt

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,140
These are all actions of not respecting you.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,510
I thought that doing these was for your own good, but I never asked what you needed.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,950
Are you willing to give me more time to learn?

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,920
I'll try my best to understand you in the future.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,540
We have to communicate when anything happens

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,380
and be honest with each other, okay?

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,940
Okay.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,220
You said that you wouldn't do anything.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,610
If I don't hug my entire world, then how can I sleep?

33
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,760
Good morning.

34
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,290
If your clothes are in the blanket and your not wearing it, do you need me to help you?

35
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,670
No need, I can do it myself.

36
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,840
You really don't need me to.

37
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,280
Really.

38
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,720
You really don't?

39
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,290
See, it's all your fault.

40
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,360
Then I apologize.

41
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,840
Your trying to murder your husband?

42
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,960
I will blow it for you.

43
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,190
Perfect timing. Just as I was about to go find you, you came.

44
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,250
That man is looking for you.

45
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,810
Where is Anxin?

46
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,590
She is changing her clothes.

47
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,830
Do you not understand?

48
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,100
I have to tell you one last time.

49
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,130
If you do anything to Anxin, I will make you suffer.

50
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,350
I am also warning you, know your position.

51
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,640
Anxin is my women, I will be responsible for her.

52
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,370
Your women? Anxin is my sister.

53
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,510
That's not up to you.

54
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,350
Brother?

55
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,300
Why are you here?

56
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,260
Are you okay?

57
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,250
I'm fine.

58
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,350
Why do you look this like?

59
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,720
Yesterday, I kept calling you all night. You scared me to death.

60
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,020
Sorry! My phone didn't have any service.

61
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,200
Did he do anything to you?

62
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,020
He didn't do anything.

63
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,210
Let's go home.

64
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,540
I can walk myself.

65
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,330
-Ai Li. 
-Give that to me.

66
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,070
Thank you.

67
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,580
President Ling.

68
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,210
Brother.

69
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,990
Gu Ansheng, do you not have a car?

70
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,650
My car broke, you won't mind right?

71
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,100
Anxin, let's go.

72
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm leaving.

73
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,990
Your just going to leave like that?

74
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,810
Goodbye. I'm leaving now. Get some rest.

75
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,520
What's wrong?

76
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,370
You're my person. Don't get too close to other men.

77
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,510
When did I become your person.

78
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,490
Last night-

79
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,450
Anxin.

80
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,340
You two? Last night?

81
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,310
Even though I don't like you.

82
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,520
But you are an important person to Anxin.

83
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,930
Don't worry, I will treat her well.

84
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,630
I don't agree.

85
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,140
President Ling, do you think Gu Ansheng will continue to block you and Miss Anxin?

86
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,210
I trust Anxin.

87
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,080
Brother, it's been dry recently. You should drink more water.

88
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,450
What's going on?

89
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,170
Yesterday, you didn't really... with him...

90
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,060
Brother, do you really want to talk about these 18+ things?

91
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,090
- It's so awk— 
 - Anxin.

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,330
Sorry.

93
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,000
Did he take advantage of you?

94
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,590
It's not what you think.

95
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,180
So it was of your own free will?

96
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,060
Brother, in truth,

97
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,160
in truth you should try to get to know Ling Yue.

98
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,460
I'm telling you, I can't.

99
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,020
Why not? Don't be so biased against him.

100
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,200
Just try to get to know him. Besides,

101
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,880
it's not like it's either him or you.

102
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:37,210
If I tell you that it is either him or me,

103
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,430
who would you choose?

104
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,340
- No, Brother— 
 - It's fine.

105
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,270
I'm sure you didn't rest well yesterday. Go and rest a little more.

106
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,620
I'll leave now.

107
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,280
Come, come.

108
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,790
- Sit. 
 - There's this too.

109
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

110
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,140
- Xixi, look. Pour it to here, got it? 
 - Oh, okay.

111
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,160
Look at this line.

112
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,310
It's easy to get drunk if you drink alone. If you get drunk, who will send you home?

113
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,700
Anxin?

114
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,130
You're so good-looking, how could I feel at ease? 
 <i>(Anxin literally means "feel at ease")</i>

115
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,930
Anxin.

116
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,090
I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.

117
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,360
These things, you have to learn yourself, okay?

118
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I remember now.

119
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,490
Excuse me, can I have a glass of water?

120
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,280
Hello?

121
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,930
What's wrong?

122
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,010
Right now?

123
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,910
Okay, okay. Then I'll come over now.

124
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,960
Thank you! Let's go.

125
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,950
You told me to come just so I could pay for you?

126
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,190
M-my bank card was locked a couple days ago.

127
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,820
I didn't have any money in my WeChat either, so I could only...

128
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,670
If you'd told me earlier, I could've just transferred some money to you over WeChat.

129
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,590
How come you're both good-looking and smart?

130
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,910
It was such a simple problem, how come I didn't think of that?

131
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,980
God is really too unfair to me.

132
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,180
Is there anything else you need?

133
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
Why do you smell so heavily of alcohol?

134
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,750
My friend took me out for drinks.

135
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,880
I hadn't seen him in a long time, so I drank a little too much.

136
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,840
And you still came as soon as I called? You're too kind.

137
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,090
After you sent me home last time, I didn't even have a chance to thank you.

138
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,230
Now I've bothered you again. I'm really sorry.

139
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,300
How about this, as repayment,

140
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,420
I'll take you to see a movie.

141
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,600
Don't you not have money?

142
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,810
I don't have money.

143
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,100
But I have a movie card.

144
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,360
The kind where if I report my name, I can see the movie.

145
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,710
You're Anxin's friend, so you're my friend.

146
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,960
- You don't have to bother about this. 
 - That won't do.

147
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,320
I, Xu Youyou, am very particular about fairness.

148
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,290
You buy me snacks, I pay for your movie. That way, it's fair.

149
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,020
I love this movie!

150
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,400
Thank you.

151
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,560
Oh right, what kind of movie does your brother like?

152
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,610
<i>My brother likes</i>

153
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,740
<i>The Notebook.</i>

154
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,880
These two have been separated for so long, but the male lead is still looking for the female lead.

155
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,690
Can't this female lead take a little more initiative?

156
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,220
This is too painful.

157
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,550
Perhaps when waiting becomes a habit,

158
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,840
it's not so painful anymore.

159
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,050
How do you know?

160
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,100
Perhaps I'm waiting for someone too.

161
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,520
<i>What do I do? Is he giving me a hint?</i>

162
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,280
<i>What do I do? How should I respond?</i>

163
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,040
<i>"Me too." No, that's too direct.</i>

164
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,060
<i>"I can."</i>

165
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,010
<i>That doesn't work either.</i>

166
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,960
Do you like someone?

167
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,890
For a long time.

168
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,290
<i>What is this? Didn't we just meet?</i>

169
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,430
<i>Or is it that even though we've just met, it's like we've known each other for a long time?</i>

170
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,740
<i>My God! It's so romantic!</i>

171
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,950
Then why don't you tell her?

172
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,680
I thought it would be enough for me to always watch over her quietly.

173
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,230
I never thought one day someone would take her away.

174
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,150
What do you mean? Of course you have to tell her.

175
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,770
God has already put true love right in front of you.

176
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,900
If you don't say anything, and I don't say anything, when will sweet love

177
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,670
come to us?

178
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,500
You're right.

179

180
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,010
I'll think carefully about it.

181
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,310
Thanks, Youyou.

182
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,260
Of course.

183
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,110
<i>This is a new beginning.</i>

184
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,870
<i>You've got this, Gu Anxin.</i>

185
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,850
President Ling, Miss Anxin has already begun to send out her resume.

186
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,740
The first round usually looks at educational background.

187
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm afraid her job applications won't go so smoothly.

188
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,480
That's true. Do you need me to make arrangements?

189
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,070
No need. I promised Anxin to respect her choice.

190
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,730
- Hello? 
 - Have you eatetn?

191
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,250
Yes. I just ate

192
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,290
a really big hamburger. I'm so full right now.

193
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,400
Then... is the job search going smoothly?

194
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,530
Yes, of course it's going smoothly.

195
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,790
You don't need to worry about me.

196
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,160
Be at ease.

197
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,020
I have to go to an interview. Bye!

198
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,680

<i>Good night~</i>

214
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,500
The project everyone sees here comes from the Cai Niao Inn.

215
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
According to Cai Niao Inn's logo designer,

216
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,000
his inspiration actually came from himself.

217
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,870
Because sometimes he gets off work late, and once there are many deposits,

218
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,180
there is no place to save and record them.

219
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,910
-Later, once we-
-You always have to go so far to pick up deliveries?

220
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,080
Because I get off work too late, so I can only leave the deliveries with the property manager.

221
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,310
But I can only leave it for a little while, and can't leave it for too long.

222
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,640
If picking up deliveries were like the bank

223
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,260
with unscheduled pickups, wouldn't that be great?

224
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,730
So they created this idea of an "inn".

225
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,270
In every neighborhood, they would-

226
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,490
President Ling, this company was just established.

227
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,960
It primarily focuses on neighborhood deliveries.

228
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,220
Although it looks small, but it's progression is rapid.

229
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,900
A company like this must have someone powerful behind it.

230
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,050
Since they've come to the venture capital conference,

231
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,150
-then they are looking for another path.
-Understood.

232
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,250
Alright. Next, let us welcome Ms.Gu Xin'er!

233
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,570
Can we speak alone?

234
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,940
Brother Yue, thank you so much.

235
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,160
Who knew you would support our company so much?

236
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,230
It's collaboration. This is the result of your abilities.

237
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,170
I'm really curious. What part of Cai Niao Inn attracted you?

238
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,210
After all, there are actually many small startups like ours on the market.

239
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,700
Although the Ling Group is financially capable,

240
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,150
however according to my knowledge, you aren't someone who wastes money randomly.

241
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,070
I've obviously taken a liking to the project's value and potential.

242
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,210
Your Cai Niao Inn took care of worker's inconvenience in delivery pick ups.

243
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,070
You've matched the life style of young people, and met the market's needs.

244
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,220
Most importantly, you've utilized the newest technology.

245
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,730
You've gathered middle class workers, alongside laundromats, group shopping,

246
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,970
and recycling agencies.

247
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,850
The neighborhood service inn is the center of everyday life.

248
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,640
This matches with New Way's business direction quite well.

249
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,940
So collaboration is only expected.

250
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,320
Brother Yue really understands me, so...

251
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,250
glad to be working with you?

252
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,090
Glad to work with you.

253
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,480
Oh, right. You have something on your hair.

254
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,230
Let me help you.

255
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,270
Alright.

256
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,330
Thank you.

257
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,210
There's no need to be so polite between you and I.

258
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,020
It's best to separate work and life.

259
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,920
But work and life

260
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,400
will definitely have connections.

261
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,430
I look forward to seeing you next time.

262
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,490
Don't be in a hurry. You'll find a job suitable for you sooner or later.

263
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,850
It's too hard, brother.

264
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,720
But thank you for finding time today to come job search with me.

265
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,020
Why so polite with me?

planning on having a marriage?

322
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,100
This news has greater positive impact compared to a negative impact for the company.

323
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,400
Since it is fake news, of course, we have to refute it.

324
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,500
President Ling, but Miss Gu's image has always been good.

325
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,000
She is also a daughter of the Gu family, and we also have a partnership with her family.

We can use this chance to build more publicity.

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,200
If you are willing to wait for me to finish these documents, then-

347
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,300
Of course I am!

348
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,800
But... do you need me to take care of the reporters?

349
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,600
You can ignore the rumors, it's fine.

350
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
Rumors?

351
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Then that means my chance is still here.

352
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
You brat. What are you thinking?

353
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Xin'er, I am at the age of getting married.

354
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,200
Sorry, I don't want to go today.

355
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
You don't want to go?

356
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,230
That's fine. We can go next time.

357
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,400
When you were younger, you always said you wanted to see the ocean.

358
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,100
I didn't have time to spend with you.

359
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,800
Since you were young, you were excelling in morals and studies.

360
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,000
You would always go to violin lessons once you were on break.

361
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,200
They wouldn't bring me along so I would stay at home alone and wait for you.

362
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Is it okay if I make it up to you now?

363
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,400
It's okay, Brother.

364
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
You don't need to say these things to me.

365
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,000
From now on, I won't ever let you get hurt again.

366
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,200
Actually it's okay Brother.

367
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,800
When I calm down

368
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,800
I will go find him to talk to him.

369
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
Let's not talk about others today.

370
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,300
It's just us two, with a calm quiet day.

371
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,400
Okay!

372
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
Anxin!

373
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,800
Anxin!

374
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,300
Why are you here?

375
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Aren't you scared of the water? Go back, don't come here.

376
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,000
I have to explain it to you.

377
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What do you want to explain?

378
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
Are you going to explain how you're wavering non-stop between my younger sisters?

379
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
-Brother!
-Let's go.

380
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,900
Don't-

381
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,600
Ling Yue!

382
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,000
-President Ling! 
-Ling Yue!

383
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,800
-President Ling! 
-Ling Yue!

384
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
-President Ling! 
-Ling Yue!

385
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,100
You're awake?

386
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,190
Slow down.

387
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,100
How do you feel?

388
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm fine. Why am I at the hospital?

389
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,600
Ai Li and my brother brought you here.

390
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,600
Why do you have to act so strong?

391
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,200
You scared me to death.

392
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,000
Are you worried about me?

393
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm not.

394
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,810
Anxin, Gu Xin'er, and I aren't like what the news has reported.

395
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,800
Then why did you give me the same perfume as her?

396
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,100
The perfume was my mistake.

397
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,800
That day I was talking to Ai Li about it, and she was right next to us and suggested it.

398
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,600
I didn't think she was that scheming.

399
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,600
So, you two were together?

400
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Absolutely not!

401
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,000
We are just classmates, nothing more.

402
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,200
-Also about the picture- 
-I know about the picture.

403
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,500
I am so smart, how can I not tell.

404
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,900
Oh yeah,

405
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,400
have you always been taking that medication?

406
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,500
This is a medicine that lowers the heart rate. I've been eating it for many years.

407
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,100
Every time I think I am in danger, my heart rate will increase

408
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,000
I can only use this medication to control it.

409
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,100
So...

410
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,500
is it the same with your fear of water?

411
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,600
It's all thanks to my brother that I have a fear of water.

412
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,600
<i>Why did you tell dad?</i>

413
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,800

414
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800

00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,100
I didn't know this.

418
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,200
I also said before that you were coward.

419
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,800
After being with you, I stopped taking those medications.

420
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,700
As long as I have you by my side, I will feel at calm.
