177
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,250
You might not be able to catch me.

178
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,730
Then, let's try it.

179
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,930
Mister, if you like this then I can ring it up for you. All you have to do is sign it.

180
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,070
Just pick the style you like; I already finished measuring the sizes.

181
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,890
This one is very comfortable, you and your wife will definitely love it.

182
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,520
Please send it using the fastest method.

183
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,570
Got it, there won't be delays.

184
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
Let's start.

185
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,510
You're haphazardly placing them and not being sincere.

186
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,140
You have to make the paws move.

187
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,880
If it doesn't move how will it attract fortune?

188
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,250
Over there.

189
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,140
Okay.

190
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,990
You can pray now.

191
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,230
You're actually going to pray?

192
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,750
Yes.

193
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,530
We are finally done.

194
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,090
Seeing all this, it feels like I'm going back to the beginning.

195
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,330
Just without a limp and big cockroaches.

196
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,680
But you have a good boyfriend who you can trust.

197
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,100
- What is this drawing of? 
 -Qiu Yu.

198
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,230
I mean this guy.

199
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,440
Is it not obvious, it's you.

200
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,290
Me!

201
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,520
Do I look that bad?

202
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,400
Please, the way it's tuck on the couch looks so similar to you.

203
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,210
Qiu Yu is so cute, just like you.

204
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,370
It tucks itself into a little ball whenever there's danger.

205
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,430
Let me use your phone for a little bit.

206
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,090
Sure.

207
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,440
Why you don't have a password for your phone?

208
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
Why would I need a password?

209
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,990
If I lose my phone someday and a stranger picks it up, they'll know who to call.

210
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,560
No password is risky.

211
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,800
What if your credit card number or other information gets leaked?

212
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,690
Then, you set one for me.

213
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,900
And you...

214
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,320
...do you have a lucky number or a date you like?

215
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,150
Let's use 0411.

216
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,220
Okay.

217
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,530
<i>[Password 0411]</i>

218
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,240
Senior Iron Wall Man.

219
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,720
Anti-finger hearts? I like it.

220
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,150
April 11th...Gu Xin'er's birthday is...

221
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,340
<i>[Good luck in your work]</i>

222
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,320
Thank you.

223
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,560
To celebrate your return,

224
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,320
Zhao Lei did what has never been done before and used company funds to buy this cake.

225
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,130
In your opinion, if a man uses a woman's birthday

226
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,240
as his password, what does this mean?

227
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,890
Then he must like her a lot.

228
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,280
- No... 
 - Why are you acting weird?

229
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,900
If he has dating history that I don't know about,

230
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,520
then am I waiting for the day his ex comes back

231
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,900
and obediently give up my position to her?

232
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,510
True.

233
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,130
Exes are the most troubling people on earth.

234
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,990
Actually, I'm not sure whether or not it's true,

235
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,830
but... I rarely see him using that tone when he's calling

236
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,820
so gentle and with a smile.

237
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,890
Pressure him. You have to ask him!

238
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,320
But what if I get an answer that disappoints me, what do I do?

239
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,020
I'd rather keep it to myself. Everyone has a past, right?

240
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,100
Since you have doubts, you should be more determined and protect your love.

241
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,730
Really.

242
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,310
Am I being too persistent about his past?

243
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,030
Indeed I am so afraid.

244
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,910
What if he thinks that we are unfit after we officially start dating.

245
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,790
Everyone knows that you two are together, who would try to sabotage?

246
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,020
Even if they try, we will fend them off.

247
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,090
No matter who tries to sabotage, I will never back down.

248
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,650
<i>[GB.Boxing]</i>

249
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,560
Hello.

250
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,370
Why you are here?

251
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,690
I came here for you.

252
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,660
Don't I look oddly handsome without my white robe?

253
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,720
Then I hope after the team practice,

254
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,820
you can maintain this unique handsomeness

255
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,530
We will now talk about footwork in boxing.

256
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,050
Maintain your balance, slide your feet out to strike.

257
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,670
Only when you are well acquainted with your footwork,

258
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,350
can you move your energy to your waist area.

259
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,530
- To us, the waist area is very... 
 - Hey, coach

260
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,730
You say the waist can exert power,

261
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,560
but why can I never feel it?

262
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,330
- Is it here? 
 - Yes, this area.

263
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,680
Yes.

264
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,360
Why can't I feel it?

265
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,060
Is it in the front or the back? Is it here?

266
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,660
Here? Why can't I feel it then?

267
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,750
What are you doing?

268
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,460
Who are you, you little punk? Who do you think you are? You have to guts to push me?

269
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,720
Why do you care about who I am, you creep?

270
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,390
Don't you dare touch Ai Li again.

271
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,620
I touched her, what are you going to do about it?

272
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,290
Coach, I ask for a practice round.

273
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,430
Okay.

274
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,020

Get up.

279
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,740
Sorry, I still didn't win him.

280
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,560
Winning or losing is not important. Why do you have to fight with him?

281
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,910
Do you know that you only trained twice?

282
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,270
There's a great chance that you could've gotten hurt badly.

283
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,920
I wanted to win him. I had to win him.

284
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,080
- Why are you so persistent?
- I did it for—

285
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,760
I did it for you.

286
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,610
For me?

287
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,160
I am just an amateur. But you are over-the-top.

288
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,870
If I don't do boxing, how do we find thing in common.

289
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,370
And you only like to box.

290
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,570
Like. Who told you that I like boxing?

291
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,560
You... you don't like boxing.

292
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,490
This is the job.

293
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,350
Expertise and liking something is totally different.

294
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,170
Why didn't you tell me—

295
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,840
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

296
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,030
Do you despise me?

297
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,750
Today, you are the most awesome fighter

298
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,790
on the six-meter square boxing ring.

299
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,640
No matter what,

300
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,320
I must apologize to you. Apologize in front of everyone.

301
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,090
Otherwise, I will not give up.

302
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,030
Thanks.

303
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,170
You're suddenly so gentle that

304
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,410
I'm not quite used to it.

305
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,940
What are you thinking about?

306
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,880
I'm thinking,

307
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,710
your reckless behavior today, comparable to smashing a rock with an egg,

308
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,760
might be true bravery.

309
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
Even though what you're saying is the truth,

310
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,030
but you can slightly—

311
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,790
Slightly be more euphemistic.

312
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,650
You should stop moving.

313
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,400
Isn't that the loser?

314
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,740
Coach Xiao Ai, why are you rubbing him?

315
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,980
Help rub me too.

316
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,370
You're right.

317
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,880
Right that those who show no respect

318
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,260
should be taught a lesson.

319
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,790
Why are you hitting people, Coach?

320
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,140
Now, I'm neither in the arena or in the training center.

321
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,550
So, I'm not your coach.

322
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,110
I'm just a normal person harassed by you.

323
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,480
That was so handsome.

324
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,490
Wasn't that super satisfying?

325
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,780
You should be like that in the future, do whatever you want.

326
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,670
If anything makes you unhappy, lash it out.

327
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,530
If you really don't want to talk about it, there's still me.

328
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,200
I'm willing to be your trash can 24/7.

329
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,060
It is so satisfying. Just a little regretful.

330
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,210
I should've beat him harder.

331
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,530
Don't worry. I'll do it next time.

332
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,870
Help me.

333
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,450
Here.

334
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,020
- Boss Gu.
- No.

335
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,890
I didn't even say anything yet.

336
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,220
- Usually things that start with a title have no good purpose.
- No.

337
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,020
Listen to me. I've signed a big deal for our studio.

338
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,480
A big company is secretly recruiting company image designers.

339
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,760
Boss, I have a pile of work unfinished here.

340
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,020
You must be trying to hollow me out.

341
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,010
Listen to me. If this order is fulfilled,

342
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,890
Not only will there not be a person earning the difference in prices,

343
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,830
it will allow our studio to achieve at least half a year of milk tea freedom.

344
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,790
Will do. Go for it.

345
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,590
- Working makes me happy. Overtime makes me prettier. 
- Nice.

346
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,420
You both can make earning money sound so refreshing.

347
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,400
Don't drink the milk tea.

348
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,110
- Boss Gu, in a moment—
- I can't.

349
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,460
No, listen to me.

350
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,640
What I mean is when you meet Party A,

351
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,600
don't let the surprise make you dizzy with success.

352
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,660
It's just a human. Perhaps, he has three heads.

353
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,430
The big company you're talking about...

354
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,730
It's New Way.

355
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,970
The big boss you mentioned?

356
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,280
- Young President Ling
- Then why didn't you say that earlier?
- No.

357
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,400
- I was afraid that you'd avoid it.
- I—

358
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,210
In the case that you run from it, then our sales performance this month will be a zero.

359
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,360
Even if it's said that avoiding rousing suspicion will create troubles

360
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,070
but let me tell you, this is too big.

361
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,510
No, let's leave now.

362
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,580
Boss Gu, Boss Gu.

363
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,640
We're already here. And I did some research for you.

364
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,510
For this company, those who know your relationship with young President Ling

365
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,760
isn't even enough to count.

366
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,580
- Really?
- For real.

367
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,010
So, just think of the milk tea.

368
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,140
And the money.

369
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,250
- For the money. 
- For the money.

370
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,270
- For the milk tea. 
- For the milk tea.

371
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,670
How cold, how ruthless, how charming.

372
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,360
He rarely likes to smile too.

373
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,130
Forget it that there are no bevy of young women.

374
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,210
Even if he's so gorgeously dressed, he doesn't have any rivals.

375
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,440
Mr Doom doesn't just distance himself from women.

376
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,570
He's even more decisive towards men.

377
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,820
Which mysterious person can make our Iceberg Prince surrender?

378
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,130
Who is he waiting for?

379
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,830
No, it's the strange woman.

380
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,710
It's her. Give advance warning about a dangerous person.

381
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,210
President Ling, please take good care of me in the future.

382
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,900
If there are opportunities, we must collaborate more.

383
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,750
She's just a vendor.

384
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,030
Look at her. From top till bottom, nothing seems right about her.

385
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,310
Her make-up and dressing are full of flaws. The probability as a rival is zero.

386
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,660
That's right.

387
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,570
Zhao Lei tricked me into coming here.

388
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,980
I didn't know this work is related to your company.

389
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,380
I wasn't aware of this too. This collaboration is purely coincidental.

390
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,430
That's right. President Ling didn't arrange this.

391
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,630
Anyway, I don't want anyone know I am your girlfriend.

392
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,310
I don't want others to say that I used connections to be here.

393
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,490
I don't want you to be partial to me too. Understand?

394
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,450
Thank you, President Ling.

395
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,990
This way, please.

396
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,360
President Ling.

397
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,350
Control yourself.

398
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,690
What if I can't control myself?

399
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,760
Work hard to control yourself then.

400
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,470
Stop it.

401
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,960
The unique feature of our company is comics. However, in the current market,

402
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,790
internet companies and comics can have collisions of ideas and create sparks. This is rarely seen.

403
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,550
We have done many investigations in this case study.

404
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,940
If there's a need, I can do some analogies for your reference.

405
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,800
President Ling.

406
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,350
President Ling.

407
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,650
Frankly, you don't need to participate in this kind of small project sign-ups.

408
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,660
I'm here to spot-check on the work of the Marketing department.

409
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,340
What's wrong, any problem of this?

410
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,770
No problem, no problem.

411
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,170
Miss Gu, if there's no problem with the contract,

412
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,440
we will follow up with the proposal after the advance payment is made. This is normal procedure.

413
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,460
Okay, fine. We look forward to our collaboration.

414
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,050
Thank you.

415
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,590
Wait.

416
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,840
Are you Director Gu?

417
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,550
Yes.

418
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,240
You come to my office.

419
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,860
I have some ideas to convey to you privately.

420
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,120
We have never seen President Ling being so serious in our work.

421
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,500
You must do a good job.

422
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,890
Otherwise, we will die because of him.

423
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,650
Don't worry. We don't die.

424
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,050
What are you doing by calling a woman into your office?

425
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,830
You didn't even call Zhao Lei.

426
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,790
Director Gu, close the door.

427
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,380
What are you doing?

428
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,940
Miss Gu, how's my performance?

429
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,170
You...you performed well but if you do this,

430
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,730
it's easy to be discovered.

431
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,630
Don't scream.

432
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,310
If you scream, all previous efforts will be wasted.

433
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,370
What are you doing?

434
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,030
I can't control myself.

435
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,120
What do you mean? Don't scare me.

436
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,470
I can't control myself anymore.

437
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,260
♫ <i>You are cold and unapproachable</i> ♫

438
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,450
Okay. If there's no one around, you don't need to control yourself.

439
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,040
♫ <i>Carelessly picked up love</i> ♫

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000
<i>[Cai Niao Station]</i>

445
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,000
Did you return this

446
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,500
or did Anxin return this?

447
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,800
Xin'er.

448
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
What's up?

449
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,000
Do the boss of an entertainment company need to come personally to discuss the endorsement?

450
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,770
You are Party A for this.

451
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,400
Looks like we don't need to discuss the collaboration.

452
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,000
Don't we already have the spokesperson?

453
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Who is it?

454
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,900
Do you think there's someone more suitable than you?

455
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,600
Endorsing Cai Niao Station? Mr Sheng, you must be joking.

456
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,700
Xin'er, do you know?

457
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,000
The florist told about the language and name of these flowers.

458
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,400
It's White Rose, I'm good enough for you. I hope we can have a good collaboration.

459
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,200
As for me, I finally have the chance to spend the nights and days with you.

460
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
Seems like you are going to take full responsibility

461
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,600
for this endorsement activity.

462
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,200
For now,

463
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I can only return the invitation to you for next month's anniversary celebration.

464
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,440
If you didn't mention this,  I would have forgotten about this.

465
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,600
What is this?

466
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,200
Is he worth it?

467
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,300
You won't understand.

468
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,400
Why won't I understand?

469
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,200
Haven't I always been waiting for someone?

470
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,800
I hope that, one day, she can turn back and look at me.

471
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,800
If she doesn't know how to turn back?

472
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
I will keep standing behind her to protect her.

473
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,000
I will keep waiting.

474
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,000
By the way,

475
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,600
what should we have for dinner?

476
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,600
Xin'er,

477
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,400
I just want to tell you, I will love you all along.

478
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
I can keep repeating this confirmation to you.

479
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,490
I'm hungry. Let's go for dinner.

480
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,600
Let's go.

481
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
You are still here?

482
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,700
You are here alone. Why did you switch on all the lights?

483
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
My water bills, electricity bills...

484
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,800
Mike found a girlfriend.

485
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,100
Well...

486
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,000
you still haven't gotten over him?

487
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,400
I'm performing the exit ceremony.

488
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,400
I liked him for 7,421 days.

489
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
How could I simply forget this?

490
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,600
Everything fine. You can use my stuff anytime.

491
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,300
Stop crying.

492
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,200
What are you talking about? Whether it's online or in person,

493
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,000
no matter how much I invest in it, there's no result at all.

494
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,400
This is...

495
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
No.

496
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,400
I think you are great.

497
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,800
It's true.

498
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,400
There may be some small errors in the way you worked for it

499
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,300
but in fact,

500
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,600
you are worth being loved by someone.

501
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,300
Really?

502
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,400
Definitely so. It's my real sentiments.

503
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,400
BBC today produced a documentary on Rebuilding Notre Dame de Paris.

504
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,800
This is a collaboration with France, United States, Australia

505
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,400
and completed by many agencies.

506
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,700
The video has a strong sense of reality.

507
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,200
Please enjoy the short excerpts.

508
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,940
Older Brother, what brings you here?

509
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,500
I got your address from Youyou.

510
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,000
I have these daily necessities for your temporary stay here.

511
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
I didn't managed to deliver these to you.

512
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,800
In fact, you didn't need to trouble yourself.

513
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,100
When did you start to be so formal with me?

514
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,340
About what happened in the past.

515
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,200
I'm sorry.

516
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,800
When it comes to feelings,

517
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,200
there's no right or wrong. Let bygones be bygones.

518
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,600
Let's be just like in the past.

519
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,800
<i>The Rose Window in Notre-Dame was burned. The raging fire lasted for twenty fours.</i>

520
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
<i>The monument stood for 850 years.</i>

521
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,000
There are nothing that always stays the same.

522
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,200
Did you hear that?

523
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,200
Notre-Dame de Paris was badly damaged too.

524
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,190
If...

525
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,800
Quasimodo didn't hide his feelings,

526
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,000
the story could have been different.

527
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,100
Would Esmeralda be touched?

528
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
I don't know.

529
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,000
But, there is not many 'if' in this world.

530
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,200
Everything must go forward, Older Brother.

531
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,800
My Anxin has really grown up.

532
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,000
Don't be burdened by what happened in the past.

533
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,800
Let's go back to the way we were.

534
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,200
I have something to do, I leave now.

535
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,000
Bye.

536
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,600
You are back. I will heat up the food I cooked for you today.

537
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,850
Who was here before?

538
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,260
Noone.

539
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,200
Gu Ansheng, right?

540
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
How do you...

541
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,800
You knew it and why you still asked.

542
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,000
I didn't tell you because I worry you are upset.

543
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
How would I be unhappy?

544
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,400
What's wrong? Your older brother is worried about you?

545
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,000
No. He delivered the stuff I left at his home.

546
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,200
Isn't there a courier?

547
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,600
I knew you would be like that.

548
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:27,380
Ansheng is just my older brother and nothing more.

549
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I am really tired today.

550
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,000
I have so many work to do and prepared the meal for you.

551
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Not only you didn't praise me, you threw tantrum at me too.

552
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,200
You delivered this cake that fast as an apology?

553
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,800
I'm not like some little monster without any conscience.

554
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,100
I'm the one without any conscience?

555
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,000
What's wrong? Ran into some problems?

556
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,300
It's common to hit a plateau for creativity.

557
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,200
Hence, this cake came in time.

558
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,000
Take it slow. You will find the solution.

559
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,920
In future, you meet your brother, don't hide from me.

560
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,600
Not right, you don't meet him at all.

561
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,300
Then, I should see him or not see him?

562
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,190
Anyway, you cannot hide from me.

563
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,150
Fine.

564
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Now that we are talking about this,

565
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,000
I will make a confession.

566
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,200
There are certain things I wonder whether I should ask.

567
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,200
Please talk.

568
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,600
Who has been calling you every evening?

569
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,400
<i>[Xiao Yishan]</i>

570
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,600
Xiao Yishan?

571
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,400
Why is he calling you?

572
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,000
He wants me to help  him to pursue Ai Li.

573
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,800
<i>- Hello. 
- Help me, help me. I'm hanging up.</i>

574
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

575
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,600
<i>I hurt my back. I even pulled off the handle of the door in the toilet.</i>

576
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,000
<i>I'm being locked up in the toilet now.</i>

577
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,200
<i>I'm going to grow old with the toilet.</i>

578
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,800
<i>Shouldn't you call 120110 for the retirement center? Why call me instead?</i>

579
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,000
<i>Why are you so heartless?</i>

580
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,600
<i>Didn't I leave a spare key with you?</i>

581
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,300
<i>Insert the handle in the doorknob again and try if you can open it.</i>

582
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,300
<i>I'm going to try.</i>

583
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,200
<i>It's opened. My brain has short-circuited.</i>

584
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,400
<i>Isn't this normal?</i>

585
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,000
<i>This is the first time in my life that</i>

586
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,600
<i>I feel so miserable. Really miserable.</i>

587
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,200
<i>You shouldn't give me your spare key. You should give it to your girlfriend.</i>

588
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,830
<i>It's not like I didn't try leaving it with Ai Li.</i>

589
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,700
<i>But what can I do now?</i>

590
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,400
<i>Go and find your Ai Li.</i>

591
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,600
<i>Well...</i>

592
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,000
<i>Okay then. It's rare to come up with such a good solution, buddy.</i>

593
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,440
<i>By the way, when you go to work tomorrow,</i>

594
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,700
<i>check your back and then, do a brain scan too.</i>

595
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,800
<i>Get your brain checked.</i>

596
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,000
So, you are saying that,

597
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,700
you happily call every night because

598
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,400
you want to continue to laugh at him?

599
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes.

600
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,180
Xiao Yishan likes Ai Li

601
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,400
but he's abnormal. Why would he find you for this kind of stuff?

602
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,000
There are normal people who falls in love.

603
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,400
Who are you scolding?

604
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,700
You.

605
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,500
Don't change the topic.

606
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,600
Also,

607
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,700
let me tell you first. I'm not prying on your privacy.

608
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,000
I merely helped you to get your courier package.

609
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,400
When I took the package, I accidentally

610
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,100
took a glance and saw that it was from Gu Xin'er.

611
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,400
I returned it.

612
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,100
What's in there? So secretive.

613
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,200
I have no idea too. I didn't care.

614
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,000
Should have told me earlier.

615
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
If you told me earlier, I could have opened it to take a look.

616
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,800
What if it's something expensive? What a waste. It's not cost-effective.

617
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:12,790
Since I'm with you, I must draw the line with other women.

618
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,300
One last question.

619
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,200
Why is the password 0411?

620
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,800
You really don't remember?

621
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,700
What?

622
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,200
0411 is our first anniversary.

623
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,400
<i>[April 11, 2011]</i>

624
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,800
<i>Little Green Bean.</i>

625
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,000
<i>I will come back to find you.</i>

626
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,000
<i>0411 is our first anniversary.</i>
