good for me?

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,900
are you doing this for me or for you?

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,670
you hid this from me for so many years

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,940
until today do I find out I was the abuser

34
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,480
give us an explanation

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,260
what was that recording?

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,440
did you really transfer Lingyue's shares?

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
was it all for Miss Gu

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,140
Quiet! the recording is fake

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,610
it was all nonsense

40
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,700
till now do you still lie?

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,640
whats the situation?

42
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,070
I think everyone is really curious why I am here

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,840
this is my engagement. you irrelevant person just had to show up at the perfect time

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,130
irrelevent? I'm afraid not.

45
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,260
I'm just here to reveal the truth

46
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,430
just casually asking all the shareholders

47
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,630
a person promoted from despicable means

48
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,170
can you all really entrust the company to

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,310
despicable? whats more jaw dropping is that you brother would fake our own death

50
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,630
a person who wish to kill to keep a secret...

51
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,130
kill? accuse me of such a big crime. where's the evidence? rumors need evidence

52
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,640
things have developed to this point

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,580
you still want to cover up?

54
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,400
Lingyue, this recording, even I could forge

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,960
father is in a critical state

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,930
he has already said he wished that I would control the company shares

57
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,090
everyone here is wise

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,130
and know my father's regards

59
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,180
all support me as the company heir

60
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,380
as you? what do you have

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,720
what will you use to contend against me

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,970
'President Ling'

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,190
father

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,490
'hurry quick! let's go over there'

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,610
Dad? you are awake?

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,060
if i'm not awake, my most treasured and spoiled baby son, would have ruined the rest of his life

67
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,250
with the burden of destroying my hard earned business

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,810
most treasured?

69
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,490
you mean the most despised and most useless

70
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,240
Dad, it's been 20 years, for what? and for what?

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,290
you trust Lingyue to take care of your business

72
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,780
me, Lingsheng would be the one to ruin your house and home

73
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,560
why you trust Lingyue has right to inherit the company and me, Lingsheng

74
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,700
is only like a pet dog has to rely on you all to survive

75
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,780
you unfilial child

76
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,730
if you keep speaking badly then I won't polite

77
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,100
alright

78
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,030
you can all treat me badly but you must get this straight...

79
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,060
in this company I have the most shares

80
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,990
this company is mine no one can remove me from this spot

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,710
Lingsheng,

82
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,990
you are the youngest in our family

83
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,560
so everyone spoils you

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,780
but I wouldn't think it spoiled you like this

85
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,800
cause you to not know right from wrong and for selfishness

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,070
hurt your siblings

87
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,230
how can you do this, child?

88
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,040
everyone...

89
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,660
I, Lingtian today will announce

90
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,890
the current 20% in my hands

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,130
without conditions transfer to Lingyue

92
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,440
although it's not as much as the shares in the hands of this unfilial child

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,200
but through the heart

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,710
we don't value the quantity but the quality

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,050
I also have 10% transfer it all to Lingyue

96
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,180
now Lingyue has 30%

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,620
brother, are you crazy?

98
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,940
you going to give your money to a adoptee

99
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,310
Lingsheng! he is like you, both my younger brothers

100
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,660
let's go back

101
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,310
let me tell you, from the start I was not going to let this go

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,570
fine, now we have equal amount of shares

103
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,210
dad, you are already getting older

104
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,850
and have a weak body. you can entrust the company to me

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,960
you who is so ambitious

106
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,720
I would never entrust you with the company

107
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,780
fine

108
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,690
then all the shareholders here today will vote

109
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,430
who goes and who stays

110
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,380
as naturally goes

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,960
no need

112
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,130
Gu Anxin, you are not apart of this you don't get to speak

113
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,140
I have company shares, I also count as a shareholder

114
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,700
I have 5% that Uncle Ling gave my mother

115
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,060
plus my 5% we have more right to speak

116
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,330
a measly 5%

117
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,800
all shareholders combined is equal to 20%

118
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,940
not to mention we already reached a consensus

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,890
for Lingshi we have made better of plans

120
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,680
you don't need to feel remorse

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,450
Lingshi under you would only be slowly ruined

122
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,080
leaving it to me is the best option

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,780
Lingyue, help me up

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,490
to all shareholders

125
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,860
I, Lingtian have a few things to say

126
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,120
everyone here has been with me through thick and thin

127
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,780
from startup and coworkers

128
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,260
to friends

129
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,360
I pulled you all into this mess

130
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,910
I deeply apologize

131
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,120
today, Linshi Company

132
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,750
was not build be just me

133
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,960
was from everyone's participation

134
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,250
and built together

135
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,410
I believe every shareholder here

136
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,970
passion towards Lingshi

137
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,260
can even go past my own

138
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,650
so everyone knows at this climax

139
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,550
Lingshi most needs...

140
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,440
what?

141
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,530
hope everyone will be able to make the most wise decision

142
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,310
for everyone's collaborative effort

143
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,370

You prepared this long ago, didn't you?

170
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,220
You had to bring ruin upon me to be content?

171

173
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,080
Child, turn back.

174

Xiao Sheng, we already reported your previous actions

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,220
to the police. If you admit your crime, there's still time.

Brother! How is he?

178
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,890
Dad's CT scan showed a brain tumor.

179
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,730
They're now giving emergency treatment inside.

180
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,330
Brain tumor? How can that be?

181
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,030
It's all my fault. I was always worrying about Xin'er and Mom.

182
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,530
I didn't even notice that Dad...

183
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,510
It's all my fault.

184
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,220
Brother, don't blame yourself.

185
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,120
No one wants something like this to happen.

186
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,580
Then what about Xin'er?

187
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,180
Xin'er is currently being investigated by the police.

188
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,800
My mom... she couldn't take all this news at once. She is also being hospitalized now.

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,560
The police said that once she is more stable, they will continue the investigation.

190
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,620
Doctor, how is he?

191
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,550
Mr. Gu's surgery was very successful. However, he will experience after-effects.

192
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,290
It's because this brain tumor was pressing against his cranial nerve for a long time.

193
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,690
Mr. Gu's hippocampus and sebum

194
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,300
have atrophied. To be precise, Mr. Gu has developed Alzheimer's.

195
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,320
It's what we commonly call senile dementia.

196
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - Of course.

197
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,380
Don't worry. It's okay.

198
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,920
We'll find a way together, okay?

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,190
I never even got to tell him the truth.

200
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,230
Now he won't have me in his memories anymore.

201
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,770
Then we'll spend time with him so that his present memories are all good ones.

202
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,550
Mom, I came to see you.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,240
I talked with the doctor. Dad has recovered very well.

204
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,620
He'll be able to leave the hospital at the end of the month.

205
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,250
Mom, the police will come soon.

206
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,920
They hope that we will cooperate in their investigation.

207
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,460
Mom.

208
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,350
I don't know where you started to go wrong.

209
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,260
But from now on, let's return to the right path,

210
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,960
okay?

211
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,320
Okay?

212
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,890
The food has gotten cold.

213
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,120
I'll go heat it for you.

214
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,920
<i>I've heard that in life, there are two kinds of people that you must never forget.</i>

215
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,770
One kind is those who have helped me.

216
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,730
The other is those who have pushed me into dire straits.

217
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,290
But I don't know why I met these two kinds of people

218
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,120
in the same person.

219
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,160
How much I hate you is how quickly I hope you get better.

220
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,460
I want to hear you explain to me why you treated me like this.

221
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,920
If it's so hard to think of a reason to hurt someone,

222
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,600
then why did you make the decision so quickly back then?

223
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,230
I shouldn't have to tell you

224
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,860
where to go next, right?

225
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,800
Why don't you just punish me directly?

226
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,100
The police and the law will punish you.

227
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,720
But it's a waste of your talent.

228
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,290
Are you not afraid I'll run?

229
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,920
Up to now, my Brother Wu has never misjudged anyone.

230
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,130
<i>[Long Wu]</i>

231
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,120
When you come out, call me.

232
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,030
Barring unforeseen circumstances, I'll still be here in 80 years.

233
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,270
I just hope that your skills will be used on the right path.

234
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,860
<i>[Long Wu]</i>

235
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,330
Dad's memories are all from his youth.

236
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,730
Oh right, I've already put in the request to defer my studies.

237
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,190
In a few days, the approval will be issued.

238
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,110
Right now, my family needs me, and the Gu Group needs me.

239
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,460
I can't have both my career and my education after all.

240
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,630
Actually, I can take care of Dad.

241
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,960
Right now, I only care that Dad's lifelong effort and career will be carried on.

242
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,360
My mom's situation isn't too optimistic either.

243
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,660
I want to spend more time with her.

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,360
To be honest, if you asked me to forgive her now,

245
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,230
I don't think I could.

246
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,590
But it's all passed now.

247
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,530
I hope she can start over.

248
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,560
Oh right. Your room has already been rearranged to how you liked it when you lived there.

249
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,960
You will always have a home here.

250
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,170
I will fulfill my duties as your brother to the end.

251
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,930
Xin'er.

252
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,930
Sister.

253
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,640
<i>I'll go get you both something to drink.</i>

254
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,600
How are you?

255
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,130
Pretty good.

256
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,300
I've explained everything.

257
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,600
What happened with Yu Guo was my fault. I will take responsibility.

258
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm sorry.

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,430
In truth, I should have said that long ago.

260
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,270
It's just that I always relied on my parents spoiling me.

261
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,360
I took it for granted.

262
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,500
My sense of infallibility

263
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,030
and narrow-minded selfishness

264
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,460
hurt you and Yu Guo

265
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,700
in ways that can never be remedied,

266
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,400
no matter how much I apologize or how remorseful I feel.

267
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,350
From now on, each time you call me 'sister',

268
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,280
it will cancel out 10 apologies. That takes immediate effect.

269
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,220
I hope that we can live as we each would like to live.

270
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,620
Okay.

271
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,840
Sister.

272
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,510
Dad.

273
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,790
You're back.

274
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,430
Dad, how's your health?

275
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,640
Why don't we go to the hospital and check it out?

276
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,560
My body...

277
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,280
I know my body well.

278
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,020
It's fine.

279
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm sorry, Dad.

280
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,140
Since he was young, Ling Sheng

281
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,980
has been pampered by everyone in the family.

282
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,560
He surely was spoiled rotten.

283
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,170
If he had  only succeeded in getting the family estate,

284
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,510
I wouldn't begrudge that.

285
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,560
But, these outrageous acts [Ch: offense against Heaven and reason],

286
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,050
like this plot to murder members of the family,

287
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,200
I can't forgive him for that.

288
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,760
Dad, I think my little brother is still young.

289
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,620
As long as he is truly remorseful,

290
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,660
there's still time for everything.

291
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,740
I always thought

292
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,820
that the men in the Ling family could be raised like wolves teach their young.

293
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,460
Raise them with an awareness of how to compete and think of danger in times of safety.

294
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,630
But the result? The opposite of what I wanted.

295
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:15,300
To him, I really wasn't fair and square when it came to children education.

296
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,690
All of this

297
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,500
is the result of my incompetence as a father.

298
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,390
Dad.

299
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,180
In my heart,

300
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,470
you're a great father.

301
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,030
You've always been that.

302
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,100
Do you see? All these things are arranged in style.

303
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,560
I designed it. The old man's office should take on an entirely new look.

304
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,250
Look here. I chose these photographs.

305
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,850
Aren't they interesting?

306
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,960
I don't think they'll do.

307
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,690
No. You haven't even assumed your position formally yet,

308
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,590
and you're putting on airs.

309
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,220
What I mean is that this doesn't belong to me.

310
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,720
What are you saying?

311
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
Brother, I'll give this to you.

312
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,180
Dad already said that the Group is yours to manage.

313
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,730
Again, the tickets for touring the world are already reserved.

314
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,600
This is just disturbing my natural rhythms.

315
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,920
The person that Ling Shi Group needs most is you.

316
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,350
Dad just gave this to me to handle. But I'm the one who can decide how to handle it.

317
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,720
So, I'll leave Ling Shi Group to you.

318
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,710
What about you?

319
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,970
Establish a 5G logistics business. Realize Ling Xiao's plan.

320
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,840
Create a New Way that can change people's lives for the better.

321
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,350
That's my thinking and my objective.

322
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,360
- I regret this.  - Regret what?

323
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,490
You should have said this earlier; I changed the style in here to what you like.

324
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,840
Look at those photographs behind you. I'll be facing them every day as I work.

325
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,640
Where will I get my inspiration?

326
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,280
From my style.

327
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,740
What beauty is there to appreciate there?

328
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,520
Welcome to our Milky Way cartoon office.

329
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,400
There are a few requirements I need to make clear to you at the beginning.

330
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,540
This is a very fashionable company.

331
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,050
And it's a very strict company.

332
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,600
- A culture of overtime work. 
 - A wolf-character philosophy.

333
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,460
- No days off. 
 - On call 24 hours a day.

334
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,000
- No procrastination on drawings. 
 - Unlimited revisions.

335
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,100
A soulless punch card machine.

336
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,840
Anything like lax discipline is not allowed.

337
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
Did we scare you?

338
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,450
All that was just in fun.

339
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,850
We actually have a relaxed atmosphere in our work.

340
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,080
Our mission is to work and create joyfully.

341
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,860
Okay, you're off work for today.

342
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,830
When you come to work tomorrow, you'll understand the feeling.

343
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,510
<i> [Ling Yue] </i>

344
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,710
<i> [Gu Ansheng] </i>

345
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,780
I will very quickly  develop the

346
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,980
purpose and plans for this collaboration.

347
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,450
I'm actually quite curious about the plans you and Anxin have.

348
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,890
Is this your concern as my brother?

349
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,140
As a brother who once loved her and will continue to love her.

350
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,580
That makes me feel quite threatened.

351
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,410
A little sense of danger isn't a bad thing.

352
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,380
Don't worry. Anxin is the person I love.

353
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,300
And she's my family.

354
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,070
What are you doing?

355
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,460
Acting so respectable and polite is so exhausting. And I can't do it.

356
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,570
Besides the family already has a boss. Isn't good enough that l just draw my cartoons?

357
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,750
You'll get used to it over time: being the artist, Anxin.

358
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,440
My ancient style comic, I Accidentally Picked Up a Prince,

359
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
the separate edition is already in process.

360
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,580
But you have to change the name. The market already has illegal copies with that name.

361
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,670
Disgusting.

362
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,550
Okay. Boss. Ms. Boss.

363
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,110
Let this hard-worker think about it, okay?

364
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,880
Good luck.

365
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Young Miss Boss, time to go home?

366
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
Although I'm one of the bosses here,

367
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,860
based on reason, you should be the young Miss Boss.

368
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,510
We're dating, not doing some business to accomplish a mission.

369
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,330
I'm used to this profession.

370
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,150
Actually,

371
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,420
you could call this an intense date.

372
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,680
But I think it makes up for the previous time we've lost.

373
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,040
There are still a lot of things that we haven't said;

374
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,170
a lot of things we haven't done.

375
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,460
Since it's like that, let's take it slowly.

376
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,370
After all, we still have a lot of time ahead.

377
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,250
In my current state,

378
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,060
you must be very disappointed in me.

379
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,790
Very disappointed.

380
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,620
But I'm also very worried

381
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,110
and wondering.

382
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,790
Everything has fallen apart.

383
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,860
It's peaceful.

384
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,110
For all of this I have only myself to blame.

385
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,470
You can begin a new life for yourself.

386
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,060
I won't let you be tangled up and dragged down by this.

387
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,550
These days...

388
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,170
I keep thinking back

389
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,080
to things that happened when we were young.

390
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,980
Those things

391
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,890
were all for completing homework

392
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,410
and worries over exams.

393
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,310
pure and wonderful

394
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,800
I would also think

395
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,800
if we could restart

396
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,100
to the first time I met you

397
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,200
would everything be different

398
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,500
i'm sorry

399
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000
i can finally understand you

400
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,000
how you felt at that time

401
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
you won't understand

402
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,800
how would I not know

403
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,700
haven't I also been waiting for someone

404
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,800
waking up every morning

405
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
I have things to do

406
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
and places to go

407
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,200
and have someone who needs me waiting for me

408
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,800
how is it you show up when I was feeling down

409
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,500
I want to know if he is well

410
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,200
and help him heal

411
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
and hope he doesn't worry

412
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
or be afraid

413
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and hope everyday he

414
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,800
is simply happy

415
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,500
and can smile genuinely

416
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,010
do you know?

417
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,000
these things now

418
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,380
is my happiness

419
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,840
I don't deserve you

420
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,250
and I don't want

421
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,100
you to see my ugly past

422
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,400
and still willing to stand with me

423
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,800
well...

424
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
our time together

425
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
i'm already really happy

426
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
Linghseng

427
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
look

428
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,850
i am prepared

429
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
all those days you waited alone...

430
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,200
i will spend the rest of my life to repay you

431
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,000
i hope one day you would look back at me

432
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,000
as long you nod

433
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,400
i can without reason run to you

434
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,600
Xiner is like the moon in the sky

435
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,600
beautiful and bright

436
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
to get closer to her

437
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,800
i prepared for so many years

438
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,100
now I can finally stand next to her

439
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,400
and hold her hand

440
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
to accompany her with laughter

441
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,500
and tears and growing old

442
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,800
when I think about this

443
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,600
I am the happiest man in the world

444
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,400
and I will also make the the happiest

445
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,300

the iron law I told you yesterday do you remember?

449
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
yeah I memorized...

00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,700

Ling Yue!

522
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,600
Ling Yue!

523
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,880
Gu Anxin.

524
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,360
Where did you run off to?

525
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,170
I was so worried.

526
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,660
I have something I want to tell you.

527
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,400
What is it?

528
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:18,590
I want to tell you that I'm not someone who likes unforeseen circumstances.

529
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,190
So I always take every precaution when doing anything.

530
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,200
Just like you said, I'm like an armadillo.

531
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,240
All of a sudden,

532
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,740
the first person in my life who made me feel

533
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,940
so unprepared,

534
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,460
is you.

535
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,670
When we were little, we brushed past each other because of an unforeseen circumstance.

536
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,000
<i>Go!</i>

537
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,600
<i>Little Bean, I will come back to find you.</i>

538
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,120
When we grew up, we met again because of an unforeseen circumstance.

539
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,720
<i>Wake up!</i>

540
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,750
But I really treasure these unforeseen circumstances.

541
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,240
I think that perhaps all of my preparations

542
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,470
were so that I could meet you again.

543
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,700
After I got together with you,

544
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,510
I did some things that I've never done before.

545
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,670
<i>In the future, can you research some more food?</i>

546
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,130
<i>Then in the future, I'll cook for you everyday.</i>

547
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,880
<i>Your so-called dignity</i>

548
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,220
<i>neglected all of my efforts.</i>

549
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,570
<i>Everything I did was for your sake. Do you have to get so mad at me?</i>

550
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,980
<i>I shouldn't have interfered with your affairs. I failed to respect your actions.</i>

551
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,820
<i>I thought I was doing it all for your sake.</i>

552
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,460
<i>But I never asked you what you needed.</i>

553
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,970
<i>I won't interfere with your affairs in the future.</i>

554
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,130
<i>I will love you in the way you want me to.</i>

555
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,310
<i>Are you willing to give me some more time to learn how?</i>

556
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,490
No matter what difficulties I face,

557
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,640
as long as it's to protect you, I am filled with courage.

558
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,500
If it's okay, I'm willing to use all of my life

559
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,280
<i>to protect you.</i>

560
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,760
<i>Are you okay? Don't worry.</i>

561
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,740
<i>Ling Yue, be careful!</i>

562
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,710
You, the you who says "No problem!" in any circumstance, gave me this courage.

563
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,710
Because as long as I have you by my side, I feel at ease.

564
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,580
<i>Then again, after a while, this angry chicken look of yours</i>

565
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,530
<i>seems pretty cute.</i>

566
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,250
<i>Shut up.</i>

567
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,130
So,

568
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,750
Miss Gu Anxin,
