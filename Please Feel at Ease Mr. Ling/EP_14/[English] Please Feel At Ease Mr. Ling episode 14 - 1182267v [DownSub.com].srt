00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,150
Brother Yue, your tie is crooked.

22
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,690
Ling Yue!

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,280
Anxin, why are you here?

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,970
If I hadn't come, I would definitely have been cheated on.

25
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,790
Right, Xin'er?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,980
It's not what you think.

27
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,920
Then what?

28
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,280
Anxin, don't wrongly blame him.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,450
I'm not talking to you.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,080
If you want someone to blame, blame me.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,650
Enough.

32
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,900
Ai Li, escort Miss Gu out.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,450
Miss Gu, please.

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,280
Wait.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,220
This is yours, right?

36
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,660
You like it? If you like it I'll give it to you.

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,170
You can give away a phone, but you can't give a boyfriend away.

38
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,510
You understand that, right?

39
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,250
Of course.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,950
Take it back. My phone is perfectly fine.

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,780
We should each mind our own things. Do you understand?

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,420
Then I'll take my leave. Goodbye.

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,930
It really was a misunderstanding. It's not what you think.  Oh, really?

44
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh, really?

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,380
She was about to leave, but tripped which is what you just saw.

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,840
Then this Miss Gu can really fall.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,700
You know that I-

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,570
Ew, don't put my hand on that lipstick print.

49
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,540
It's burning.

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,420
What are you doing?

51
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm changing my clothes so you won't be upset.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you absolutely silly?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,110
You're taking off your clothes in the office. If anyone sees, they'll think-

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,410
Then I'll change later.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,320
This is nice.

56
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,400
It must've been hard lately, right?

57
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,460
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,360
I don't have any way to help you.

59
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,970
Please feel at ease, Mr. Ling.

60
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,320
Brother, why haven't you left yet?

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,870
I'm not so much at ease after what happened so I came to pick you up.

62
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,030
Don't worry, I've talked to the security.

63
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,160
They will be making more rounds.

64
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,490
Don't worry, it's really not a big deal.

65
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,320
Why wouldn't it be a big deal?

66
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,130
Do you remember you had a bad dream when you were younger?

67
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,040
Even though you were scared to death,

68
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,670
you still refused to make any noise so you wouldn't bother anyone.

69
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,660
Do you remember?

70
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,610
Brother, don't worry.

71
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,930
I'm not a kid anymore. And that was when I was eight.

72
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,370
I can protect myself.

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,630
Did you go on a date with You You?

74
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,610
Did you forget? You forgot?!

75
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,670
Why don't you go already? She'll kill me!

76
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,070
- Hurry, go. 
 - Then you go up.

77
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm sorry, I'm late.

78
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,980
Ansheng, no problem! Since you're so handsome, whatever you do is right.

79
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,070
Let me tell you, something big happened!

80
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,380
It says that Gu Xin'er and New Way's President are engaged!

81
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,720
Really?

82
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,620
That Ling Yue...

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,580
I'm sorry, You You. I can't watch the movie with you.

84
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,730
- I have to find Ling Yue and ask for an explanation. 
 - I will go with you!

85
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,680
That bastard.

86
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,840
Ling Yue, you...

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,880
Come out!

88
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,550
You two leave first.

89
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,200
Okay, President Ling.

90
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,530
Ling Yue, what's with you and Xin'er?

91
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,070
Right.

92
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,410
-You're making a fuss over nothing. 
-Am I making a fuss over nothing, or are you trying to hide something?

93
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,700
There's no walls that wind can't pass. 
 <i>(T/N: Secrets are bound to be discovered one day)</i>

94
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,420
Besides if there's truly nothing, what about the news?

95
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,010
Where's the news?

96
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,830
Actually it's not news, it's gossip.

97
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,140
Now is when you need us Gu family the most.

98
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,780
How could you use Anxin

99
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,460
and then use Xin'er?

100
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,170
Gu Ansheng, I'm very curious.

101
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,300
Why do you keep targeting me?

102
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,410
Why I keep targeting you?

103
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,870
You, President Ling, act decisively and there's nothing you can't do.

104
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm afraid everyone in this business is aware of that.

105
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,510
You're right.

106
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,930
I am certainly decisive, but I am not willing to use any method possible.

107
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,820
If we're talking about using any means to get his way,

108
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,330
your old man Gu is more fitting.

109
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,090
I don't need to rely on other people.

110
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,210
And I don't need your worry.

111
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,900
Ansheng, after hearing what he said are we misunderstanding him?

112
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,350
Listen up.

113
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,670
Your relationship with Xin'er will always be ambiguous in the eyes of an outsider.

114
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,620
That's why any move will cause something like this to happen.

115
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,170
To you, it may be nothing.

116
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,060
But think about Anxin. It will hurt her.

117
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,770
If you don't protect her,

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,650
I will.

119
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,220
Gu Ansheng,

120
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,240
you are just her brother.

121
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
What right do you have to protect my girlfriend in my place?

122
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,140
If you hurt her again,

123
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,730
I will take her back.

124
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,850
Then try and see if you can.

125
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,530
What are you two doing?

126
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,170
You're all family, whatever it is just talk it out.

127
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,820
Ansheng, he's explained already. Let's go.

128
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,470
Ansheng.

129
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,490
What is it?

130
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,470
Earlier when you said there was someone you like,

131
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,580
did you confess?

132
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,360
Not yet.

133
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,610
Do I know the person you like?

134
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,550
Why are you asking this?

135
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,470
Is the person you like Anxin?

136
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,280
I...

137
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,240
No matter who you like,

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,860
the person I like is you.

139
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,020
You You

140
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm sorry, I always thought

141
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,860
Why are you apologizing?

142
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,080
If you like it, then you do. And if you don't, you don't.

143
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,380
After saying it, I feel much more light-hearted.

144
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,350
Then, why don't you get in the car?

145
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,150
- I'll drive you back. 
 - No, I can get back on my own.

146
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,320
It's not safe to go back on your own. I'll drive you.

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,000
No, if you're so nice to a single girl, I'll misunderstand.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,740
Hurry and go back.

149
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,550
I don't know how Anxin will react after she sees the news.

150
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,820
You should go keep her company.

151
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,530
Then I'll go back first.

152
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,220
Let me know when you get home.

153
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,760
So embarrassing! So embarrassing!

154
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,500
My entire reputation is ruined!

155
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,410

156
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,720

157

What?

158
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,920
You're phone's out of battery-

159
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,500
What does your phone running out of battery have to do with me? I'm upset!

160
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,380
What?

161
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,960
What meeting?

162
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,830
Where's my idol?

163
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,030
Where's my charger?

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,010
You have quite the setup.

165
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,620

Everyone has been waiting a long time, right?

168
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,450
Then let's give a warm welcome to Asia's prince of music,

169
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,320
Mike!

170
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,450
Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!

171
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,990
Hello!

172
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,950
I love you guys.

173
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,300
I love you too!

174
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,660
Ok, our meet & greet officially starts now! Please take a seat, Mike!

175
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,780
We will be ending the fanmeeting here.

176
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,360
Let us bid farewell to Mike.

177
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,490
Are you okay?

178
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,910
Why are you-

179
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,910
I thought you'd be too busy fangirling and wouldn't have a chance to eat.

180
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,780
So I got you some food.

181
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,490
Have you been waiting for me?

182
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,650
Right, and this.

183
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,830
I'll carry it for you first.

184
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,700
Is there something on my face?

185
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,830
Yes

186
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,100
What?

187
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,300
A bit of cuteness.

188
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,060
Am I being flirted with?

189
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,020
<i> Are you still busy? Remember to eat. </i>

190
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,080
Why are you here?

191
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,170
I can't come?

192
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,000
Is there something wrong?

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Nothing, I just wanted to see.

194
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,840
What power does this place have?

195
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,890
To make Brother Yue return repeatedly?

196
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,720
Looks like I thought too much.

197
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,220
Aside from reeking of poverty,

198
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,350
there's nothing special here.

199
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,410
Maybe he thinks that all of this is fresh momentarily.

200
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,320
Your words are so disgusting, are you still that well mannered Miss Gu?

201
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,140
But you've always been a jealous and helpless person.

202
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,120
Jealous?

203
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,700
What would I be jealous of?

204
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,580
Should I be jealous that you have a lowly identity?

205
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,780
Please get out.

206
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,290
What right do you have to tell me to go?

207
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,600
What right?

208
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,680
The right that I am the owner of this house so I can tell you to leave.

209
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,000
Owner? Who the owner is is still up to debate.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,350
I remember that this house is rented to you by Ling Yue.

211
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,610
But that's right,

212
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,340
You really like turning the tables that much?

213
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,290
I'm telling you,

214
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,620
this is owned by Ling Yue.

215
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,790
But I pay rent every month so this is mine.

216
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,490
I have the right to tell you to leave.

217
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,730
How could such a model citizen

218
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,070
be expelled from school for purposefully hurting others?

219
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,820
It has nothing to do with you.

220
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,270
You're so savage. Does Brother Yue know?

221
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,890
Your Brother Yue

222
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,650
likes someone as savage as me.

223
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,860
Unlike you, two-faced,

224
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,020
you're pretty hypocritical.

225
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,540
So what if he likes you?

226
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,220
What worth are you feelings to him?

227
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,740
Now that he's in trouble, can you help him with your feelings?

228
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,830
Your feelings to him,

229
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,620
are a burden.

230
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,880
Ling Group's CEO position is also because of you

231
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,490
that he lost it.

232
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,390
-What do you mean? 
 -Ling Group's CEO position belonged to Brother Yue.

233
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,340
How come after his accident, he suddenly isn't?

234
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,930
Haven't you thought about the reason?

235
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,420
What exactly do you want to say?

236
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,380
You still don't know?

237
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,220
Did you think he stayed with you in this lovely haven

238
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,310
without any sort of sacrifice?

239
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,190
It's because he was tripped up over your trivial problems

240
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,040
and angered Uncle Ling.

241
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,840
That's how he lost everything that should've belonged to him.

242
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,920
The rumors on the Internet about me and Ling Yue,

243
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,170
you've seen it, right?

244
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,580
That's fake.

245
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,040
I believe in him.

246
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,430
Whether it's true or false,

247
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,500
is it that important?

248
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,390
What's important is

249
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,080
I am the only person who can help Ling Yue.

250
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,740
This point, you know it very well in your heart, isn't it?

251
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,330
You're right!

252
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,990
He only has you in his heart.

253
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,810
That's why he always refused my help.

254
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,230
But did you know?

255
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,450
Ling Yue shed lots of blood and sweat to build the New Way you see now.

256
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,080
The more strong New Way is,

257
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,710
the more Ling Yue's position is high.

258
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,810
If he ever falls down, everyone will mock at him.

259
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,400
He will fall from his peak into a pit.

260
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,430
Everyone will say he is an adopted son that only relies on his father!

261
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,580
Are you capable of watching someone as proud as him

262
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,150
give up on everything for you?

263
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,740
Even if I leave him,

264
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,250
would Ling Yue choose you?

265
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,390
It's not important whether he chooses me or not.

266
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,130
-What's important is for you to leave. 
 -Xin'er.

267
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,620
Xin'er.

268
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,190
Stop talking.

269
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,930
What's wrong, brother?

270
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,380
You want to meddle in this again?

271
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,930
If there's any problems, let's talk once we get home.

272
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,150
Go home?

273
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,990
Do you still know which one is your home?

274
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,450
Stop arguing.

275
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,860
Brother.

276
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,990
I am your biological sister.

277
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,540
The dessert shop that Anxin likes to go,

278
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,610
I also like that place. Did you know?

279
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,040
But Brother, you've never thought

280
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,580
of buying a portion for me too.

281
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,790
In your heart,

282
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,080
there's only this adopted sister.

283
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,010
Xin'er, you and Anxin are both equally important.

284
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,920
Same thing as from other, I don't want it.

285
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,960
Anxin.

286
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,450
Are you still okay?

287
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm okay, Brother. You can go back.

288
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,890
You're obviously sad. Since when did you have to stay strong in front of me?

289
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,020
Leave him.

290
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,360
I won't allow you to suffer alone.

291
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,700
Why do you always want me to leave the person I love?

292
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,090
I...

293
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,350
can't give you happiness?

294
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,150
I'm just worried about you.

295
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,620
I'm fine, Brother. You don't need to worry.

296
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,530
The news on the Internet is fake. I won't believe these things.

297
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,240
Go home and go to rest early.

298
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,690
I'm getting tired, good night.

299
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,710
Good night.

300
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,920
Even if you don't need me,

301
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,070
I will always be here for you.

302
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,160
<i>I'll eat it later. I'll come see you after I'm done.</i>

303
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,890
<i>Be good, wait for me.</i>

304
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,350
<i>[Xin'er]</i>

305
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,500
<i>[Xin'er]</i>

306
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,280
Hello, I need a designated driver.

307
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,160
The address is the entrance of Soho Bar.

308
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,330
Xin'er.

309
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,670
Why you know I am here?

310
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,110
Sorry for being late.

311
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,570
Yes, you come too late.

312
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,430
However, I have already called for a designated driver.

313
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,040
Fast Bird Designated Driver?

314
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,500
How did you know?

315
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,850
I just called to pay the designated driver.

316
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,660
Xin'er, can I get in the car?

317
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,140
Get in.

318
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,170
Why do you seem troubled?

319
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,800
When did you start to care of me?

320
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,480
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

321
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,910
Xin'er,

322
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,070
are you really preparing to enter into a marriage alliance with my second brother?

323
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,690
Since you know, why are you still here?

324
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,710
So it is true, isn't it?

325
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,560
There's indeed a preparation.

326
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,740
You are not even willing to lie to me.

327
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,210
But I declined it.

328
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,180
I planned to use this

329
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,590
to make my father spare New Way for the time being

330
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,500
But, no matter what, Older Brother Ling Yue refused.

331
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,380
It's very embarrassing to keep being declined by him.

332
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,490
Xiao Sheng.

333
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,220
Sorry. I just feel it's not worth for you to do this.

334
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,620
Doesn't matter.

335
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,610
Enough. Let's not think of this kind of problems.

336
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,250
You owe me a date. Make it up to me now.

337
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,070
I always think.

338
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,320
I have always wondered when the day would come

339
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,550
when I can be with the one I love,

340
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,650
to watch an on-air movie.

341
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,690
I don't know if I have this honor.

342
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,900
to be the one you wished for.

343
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,680
I am sorry.

344
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,990
Why need to say sorry of this.

345
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,390
Xin'er, whenever you look back,

346
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,550
I will always be behind.

347
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,330
Dad, why is someone standing at the entrance?

348
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,130
Why are you so free and staying home today?

349
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm fine.

350
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,820
Dad, did you read the news on your cellphone recently?

351
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,450
I don't do that.

352
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,300
It's bad for the eyesight to read too much news on the cellphone. Cut down on this too.

353
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,570
Dad,  I will stop doing this.

354
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,540
Dad, read it if you have the time

355
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,850
and understand how to solve the situation.

356
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,420
No need. Be direct if you have anything to say.

357
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,960
Dad, Second Brother's company is in trouble.

358
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,580
It's regarding this?

359
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,890
You already know? I thought you don't go online.

360
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,810
I don't. Can't I read the newspaper?

361
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,620
Dad, you are not bothered about him?

362
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,870
Why should I? He's doing well with his company.

363
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,400
Why should I be bothered?

364
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,830
You are not aware. Second Brother has been badly battered.

365
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,480
His resources have been cut off.

366
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,170
Your information is rather up-to-date.

367
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,440
In any case...

368
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,070
let's not talk about him.

369
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,940
Why are you tearing my head off again?

370
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,260
You keep talking about your second brother.

371
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,380
Do you want to see him in trouble

372
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,350
or are you really concerned about him?

373
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,240
How can I be concerned about...

374
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,370
I'm concerned about Ling Group.

375
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,680
Think about this.

376
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Although we granted autonomy rights to New Way

377
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,660
but we are, after all, Ling Group.

378
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,150
We have mutual interests. Right?

379
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,330
Besides, no matter what, Ling Yue is our family too.

380
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,160
He's your son.

381
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,330
If they beat him, they are slapping your face too. Isn't that so?

382
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,670
Why are you laughing?

383
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,830
I'm laughing at you.

384
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,930
You have finally grown up.

385
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,940
You know how to stand on Ling Group's perspective and think about the problems.

386
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,670
I'm just looking ahead.

387
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,480
In my memories of you as an adult,

388
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
this is the first time I heard you

389
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,990
being so concerned about your younger brother.

390
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,600
I'm not concerned about him.

391
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,090
I'm concerned about Ling Group.

392
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,550
Fine. Regardless of who you are concerned about,

393
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,240
I will pay attention to your younger brother.

394
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,380
<i>[New Way]</i>

395
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,980
President Ling, we didn't receive any positive feedback from the public after we issued the our statement.

396
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,720
What about France?

397
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,280
They probably heard about this sign of trouble.

398
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,460
They are not willing to collaborate with us for the time being.

399
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,100
Gu Yuanchao is willing to go all out for this.

400
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,320
President Ling, Gu Yuanchao knew about our bargaining chip.

401
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,230
That's how he could discuss terms with the other party.

402
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,510
However, our collaboration party signed the confidential clause.

403
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,560
Moreover, we didn't publicly announce these brands.

404
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,980
How did he get the information?

405
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,990
I'm worried about this too.

406
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,340
Are you saying that we have a spy in our company?

407
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,390
Does anyone wants go eat steamed rice with dried duck?

408
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,560
You are here.

409
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,260
- I kept a portion for you too. 
- Thank you.

410
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,050
I'm leaving.

411
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,110
I personally cooked this.

412
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,160
It took a long time.

413
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,230
You only succeeded 20 percent of mine.

414
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,810
Don't eat it then.

415
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,210
I have been too tired lately.

416
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,400
I don't have energy to eat.

417
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,280
I will feed you.

418
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,860
Okay then.

419
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,320
Fine.

420
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,940
I will feed you.

421
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,790
Open your mouth bigger.

422
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,900
What a fool.

423
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,670
I suspect you did it on purpose.

424
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,800
You wanted to choke me to death and inherit my Huabei account.

425
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,800
Do you want some? This is your favorite flavor.

426
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,200
Later.

427
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,160
I actually have something to tell you.

428
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,800
There will be a lot of nonsense online recently

429
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,600
- regarding me and— 
 - I know.

430
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,800
Don't worry.

431
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,000
I have been on the discussion forum for a long time.

432
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,200
Why could I not be sharp and see through the rumors?

433
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,200
These kind of discussion traffic, trivial nonsensical explosive news.

434
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
How could it trick me?

435
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,700
I was afraid that you'll feel wronged.

436
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,600
I won't feel wronged when I spend every moment I'm with you.

437
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
On the other hand, you're

438
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,300
so tired recently and keep overworking.

439
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,400
How can it not be tiring working without proper rest?

440
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,000
Do you want to ditch work

441
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
and let's go out to relax?

442
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Go where?

443
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,000
You'll know once we go.

That's right. I'm not afraid of heights.

It's good that you're not afraid of heights then.
