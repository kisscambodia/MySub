00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,910
Chairman.

21
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,130
I told you many times

22
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,200
to just call me dad when we're alone privately.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,490
Dad, what brought you here?

24
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,370
If I hadn't come, did you plan on waiting until New Way

25
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,290
declares bankruptcy before telling me?

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,050
That's not what I meant.

27
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,020
I will take care of it.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,710
You will take care of it?

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,600
So many years have passed in the blink of an eye, yet why do you still

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,480
act as if you are eight years old?

<i>What are you hiding?</i>

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,940
<i>-Nothing! 
 -Let me see.</i>

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,650
<i>Isn't it just a stupid spinner? What are you hiding it for?</i>

36
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,260
<i>Acting all suspicious.</i>

37
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,850
<i>I warn you, never tell mom and dad.</i>

38
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,990
<i>Or else, you'll see what I can do.</i>

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,550

Every time you encounter any difficulties,

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,940
you never asked anyone for help.

43
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,500
You didn't want your dad's help.

44
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,590
Ling Yue,

45
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,400
I owe you a lot.

46
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,410
But you need to need give me a chance to make it up to you.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,380
Dad, I am no longer the 8-years-old me.

48
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,980
I can now solve my own problems whenever I face any.

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,990
Okay.

50
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,240
We are one family after all.

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,400
Family is used to care and rely on one another.

52
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,880
After you think this through, you can come find me then.

53
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,330
All done.

54
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,290
The last dish, perfect.

55
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,960
Is the sun coming from the west now?

56
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,990
I've always made food for you all these years.

57
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,220
Today, you've invited me to a home-cooked meal.

58
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,230
I'm helping you experience

59
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,420
the cooking of a genius chef.

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,420
Amazing.

61
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,190

Scrap paper!

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,780
I knew it. My sister's still my sister.

65
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,920
She didn't suddenly turn into some genius housekeeper.

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,420
I invested so much preparing all these dishes for you.

67
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,240
I wanted you to eat some nutrients.

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,150
Eat this. I made this one.

69
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,160
This one's so good! You only made this one tiny dish?

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,740
So stingy. Don't fight for it and eat the pig trotters.

71
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,410
Ok.

72
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,940
Do you...have something you want to talk to me about?

73
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,980
No.

74
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,700
What would I have to talk about?

75
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,750
Mr.Lin, our situation...

76
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,680
please allow the company to consider it.

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,480
I understand. Thank you.

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,540
President Ling, Japan's requirements this time are too strict.

79
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,680
If you adhere to their restrictions,

80
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,460
we'll make no profit and there's no benefit to speak of.

81
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,980
What better time to take advantage of us?

82
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,580
Then...what do you plan to do?

83
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,330
I haven't decided yet.

84
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,570
It's the first time I've heard you say something like that.

85
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,840
Anxin always says, if there's really no solution,

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
then don't stress yourself out too much.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,340
Clear all the thoughts from your mind,

88
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,880
and new surprises might appear.

89
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,940
I'm going to walk around.

90
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,850
Ok. Then I will wait for your orders inside the company.

91
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,700
-Hello.
-Hello.

92
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,420
One hot Americano please.

93
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,990
Americano, right? One second, please.

94
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,980
Young man! Sheng Ju Lan's holding an event right now! Why don't you bring a set back for your girlfriend?

95
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,200
No need.

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,480
It's really very easy to use!

97
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,260
The only reason my facial skin is so smooth is all because I used Sheng Ju Lan's product.

98
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,770
You can use 300 Yuan to purchase the effect of a 2000 Yuan product.

99
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,270
It's very worth it.

100
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,430
You're welcome to come again.

101
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,780
<i>Wait! Don't move!</i>

102
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,390
<i>Why are you touching my things?</i>

103
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,960
<i>It's empty. Aren't you throwing it away?</i>

104
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,750
<i>Empty? Didn't you see there's still this much inside?</i>

105
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,220
<i>That fingernail amount is enough for you to worry over?</i>

106
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,590
<i>You really don't understand how expensive everyday life is.</i>

107
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,450
<i>This is very easy to use and also super hard to obtain.</i>

108
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,330
<i>Of course I have to use it slowly. This tiny bit can last a long time.</i>

109
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,860
<i>What's the brand? I've never seen it before.</i>

110
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,750
<i>You know PKII right?</i>
-<i>Doesn't it say KAI?</i>

111
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,000
<i>This is a small English brand called KAI.</i>

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,950
<i>It can replace PKII.</i>

113
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,440
<i>Those are all business advertising techniques. Do you really believe 300 Yuan is enough to purchase something worth 2000 Yuan?</i>

114
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,020
<i>Of course I believe it! This was something I strategized and dug up!</i>

115
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,060
<i>It's the fighter amongst all the evaluations.</i>

116
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,970
<i>Dig?</i>

117
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,740
<i>For us poor balding girls, </i>

118
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,860
<i>how could I afford to buy PKII?</i>

119
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,990
<i>I can only search for makeup products with similar evaluations to replace PKII.</i>

120
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,930
<i>They're...all similar anyways.</i>

121
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,870
Contact the business implementation department. We're holding a meeting immediately.

122
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,590
President Ling, according to your orders

123
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,980
we've collected a list of brands that are competitive against large brands in the market with their replacement products.

124
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,560
-Greetings, President Ling.
-Let's begin.

125
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,530
I need to establish collaborative relationships with all brands within an hour.

126
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,350
-The advertising department must be prepared to update the products list.
-Understood.

127
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,950
Ok. Connect them.

128
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,150
Hello, Mr.Ling. It's my pleasure to cooperate with New Way.

129
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,980
Chairman Gu, is your Shopping Carnival Celebration Event targeted towards New Way?

130
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,530
We've planned this Carnival Celebration for a long time.

131
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,560
We've just never publicized this.

132
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,530
Our Gu Group's primary focus for expansion is in the e-commerce field.

133
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,880
And New Way is an up and rising business within e-commerce.

134
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,860
So both company's events have similarities. It's absolutely normal.

135
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,960
There's no such thing as targeting.

136
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,350
But the rumors say the brands on your website

137
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,090
are all businesses originally cooperating with New Way and were intercepted by you.

138
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,040
What response do you have to this?

139
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
Didn't you say so yourself? They're all rumors.

140
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,570
As everyone knows, our Gu Group's

141
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,750
market impact and overall ability

142
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,530
is not something New Way can compete with.

143
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,990
This. Is clear to anyone with sense.

144
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,920
Also, when brands choose their collaboration partners,

145
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,440
it's hard to avoid situations with many different businesses.

146
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,330
And only the best wins.

147
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,330
This is the rule of business.

148
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,080
How can that count as intercepting?

149
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,970
In the future, don't let this reporter inside.

150
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,530
I understand, Dad.

151
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,510
Chairman Gu, what's your opinion on New Way's loophole problem?

152
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,390
This matter does not have enough evidence to prove

153
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,780
that New Way's technology has erred. Please write about this in a practical manner, reporters.

154
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,170
Stop talking! It's this situation,

155
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,870
-yet you're still helping him recover?
-Dad.

156
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,960
Of course. Young people

157
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,130
will make some lowly mistakes due to their efforts.

158
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,170
It's hard to avoid. As for this,

159
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,770
we cannot make anymore judgments.

160
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,430
But right now people on the internet claim the loophole incident is a result of Gu Group's ill-intentioned sensationalization.

161
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,800
Do you have anything to say to this?

162
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
Nonsense!

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,550
I, Gu Yuanchao, have been active in the market for many decades.

164
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,350
I've always been honest and trustworthy.

165
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,170
Would I do something like that?

166
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,530
New Way has already revealed a video.

167
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,550
Apparently, this matter was due to your Gu Group.

168
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,520
Let's go! New Way's accepting interviews!

169
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,470
What's going on? You still didn't deal with it completely!

170
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,460
Chairman, that's impossible.

171
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,080
Dad.

172
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,990
I'm sorry, Chairman.

173
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,630
We're being controlled by him.

174
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,240
Next I-

175
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,820
don't know what he'll do.

176
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,080
What's wrong?

177
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,450
-Dad, what's wrong?
-Are you ok?

178
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,150
-Go pour me a glass of water.
-Ok.

179
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,530
This is the business I wanted to speak with you about.

180
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,960
But also changing the world's business concept opportunity.

181
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,870
But you have to remember.

182
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,020
Why I want to invest

183
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,960
you are my son.

184
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,690
Thank you, Dad.

185
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Good job.

186
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,840
Thank you.

187
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,340
Since everyone has asked.

188
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,460
Do you have any other news at hands? Please answer.

189
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,380
-Excuse us. 
 -Please answer.

190
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,740
Please answer!

191
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,510
Please answer!

192
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,650
Please answer!

193
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,600
Yes, it has been prepared.

194
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,110
Why are you looking for me?

195
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm not some kind of harmful weapon.

196
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,280
Why do you have to avoid me every time you see me?

197
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,380
I just want to avoid unnecessary trouble.

198
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,360
The problem about you and my dad, I apologize.

199
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,410
The one that should be apologizing isn't you.

200
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,550
The one that should be apologizing is the person behind giving all these evil orders.

201
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,010
About this situation, I know it's my dad that did wrong.

202
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,740
Can you give him another chance?

203
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,390
Sorry, according to the time now,

204
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,310
the court's letter should have reached Chairman Gu's hands.

205
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,930
Letter?

206
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,970
Brother Yue, do you really have to do this step?

207
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,050
You should be the one going to ask Chairman Gu about this.

208
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,890
I am sorry to interrupt you today.

209
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,490
Have the legal department ready to counteract.

210
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,010
Okay.

211
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,610
Ever since the situation got exposed, Miss Gu has been staying at home.

212
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,090
I heard that Miss Gu went to beg for forgiveness to Ling Yue.

213
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,110
However, President Yue has not changed his mind.

214
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,180
I bet that Miss Gu's isn't feeling so well now.

215
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,770
How can Brother be like that?

216
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,690
President Ling, where are you going? Right now, the Gu Family is being surrounded by reporters everywhere.

217
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,620
Which media are you from?

218
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,630
First come, first serve, you know that? Go line up at the back.

219
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,380
Okay.

220
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,250
What?

221
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,520
Big bro, why are there so many people here?

222
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,770
This must be huge news.

223
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,080
No way.

224
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,380
Don't tell me you didn't even know about this?

225
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,840
Let me tell you, if you work in this field, you need to be very alert.

226
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,300
You need to follow these small gossips very closely.

227
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,500
Alright, you go play aside. If you want to learn, go find your master.

228
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,160
Who was it?

229
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,010
Xin'er?

230
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,640
Why you are here?

231
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,250
I am coming to take you.

232
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,250
Come here and be careful.

233
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,980
Sorry, you had to see this side of me.

234
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,770
Relax, I definitely would...

235
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,050
But when we were little, you would only climb a wall to skip class.

236
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,620
What is it, you still dress up so nicely.

237
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,640
When did I...?

238
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,660
<i>Sister Xin'er!</i>

239
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,020
<i>Lower your voice. People will hear your voice.</i>

240
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,850
<i>Just pretend you didn't see what happened today. Understood?</i>

241
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,580
<i>Or else I will...</i>

242
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,080
<i>-Why are you here?
-I'm waiting for my brother to finish class.</i>

243
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,330
<i>Fine, then you wait. I'll be going first.</i>

244
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,200
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

245
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,870
Such a trivial thing, you still remember!

246
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,470
To me, what situation of yours is a trivial thing?

247
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,380
I just want to find a place.

248
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,360
I could take a quiet moment.

249
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,440
But at this time right now, isn't staying at home to avoid better?

250
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
You turn me down.  Then, I leave now.

251
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,110
My princess, this way.

252
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,070
I know. Her dad is really mean.

253
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,430
The main point is that New Way's president is also mean. He actually asked for ten thousand dollars of compensation.

254
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,320
<i>Quick, let me see your shopping cart.</i>

255
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,540
What are you looking at? You've been ignoring me.

256
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,950
Don't distract me. I'm busy adding things to my shopping cart.

257
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,310
So awesome! Just within 3 minutes,

258
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,900
sales has reached over one million!

259
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,130
Where's President Ling? I have to tell him this good news!

260
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,530
President Ling already left long ago.

261
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,960
In fact, you boss is indeed your boss.

262
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,040
What's up?

263
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,380
I am asking you about Anxin.

264
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,330
Ain't I giving you chance to hurt her anymore.

265
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,370
Don't you get it?

266
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,730
<i>You are leaving.</i>

267
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,060
<i>Is that because of Ling Yue?</i>

268
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,840
<i>I...</i>

269
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,430
<i>The way we met.</i>

270
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,840
<i>It was purely the coincidence.</i>

271
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,640
<i>I heard it.</i>

272
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,680
<i>At first, I thought.</i>

273
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,280
<i>If he was staying with me, I am quite happy about it.</i>

274
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,230
<i>At that moment, I understood.</i>

275
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,170
