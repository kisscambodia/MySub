00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,390
<i> I, Ling Yue, promise to rent this house</i>

22

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,800
<i> To never raise the rent; never to sell. </i>

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,900
<i> If the terms of the contract are violated, </i>

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,320
<i> all of the rights to the house will be lost </i>

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,220
<i> and the house will be returned to Miss Anxin. </i>

27
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,930
Aren't the terms of this contract unfair to you?

28
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,390
I'm the landlord. You're paying me rent. It's very fair.

29
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,170
It's like payment of an IOU for taking advantage of you in the beginning.

30
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,210
Now it's your turn.

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,440
Thank you.

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,850
This is where our feelings for one another began.

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,980
Now, is when our feelings can grow.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,980
We can become closer and closer and never be separated again.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,260
Let's go home.

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,940
Wait.

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,080
We are official sweethearts now. A good-night kiss isn't going too far.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,140
You should go home and get some rest.

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,090
Then, tomorrow, I'll come pick you up.  Good night.

40
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,760
Good night.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Wait a second.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,500
Good night.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,340
Good night, brother-in-law.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
Who's his brother-in-law?

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,240
Come on; let's go home.

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Come on.

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,830
- He hugged me. 
 - He likes you.

48
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,900
Brother, don't be mad.

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,960
Have some Wiexun.

50
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,160
What's between you and Ling Yue?

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,390
You can so easily agree to be with him?

52
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,960
It's...it's a feeling.

53
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,640
<i> You really have fallen in love with him. </i>

54
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Brother, I heard...

55
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,730
You Your told me what happened yesterday.

56
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,860
Yesterday, maybe she was....a little...nervous.

57
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,320
Don't use You You to change the subject.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,550
Exactly what is going on between you and Ling Yue.

59
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,120
It's exactly what you saw.

60
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,810
No, Brother. Ling Yue and his family are all good people.

61
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,320
Other than that...brother....Ling Fang

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
All the others are great.

63
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,130
With one meeting you already know they're a good family?

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,650
Seeing this, I can see you've fallen deep into a pit.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,560
If you really like him that much,

66
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,550
I'm willing to let you two give it a try.

67
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,760
But you have agree to one condition.

68
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,660
If he mistreats you, you must tell me.

69
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,600
No matter what, you can't let anyone make you suffer.

70
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,760
I understand.

71
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,170
i just knew you were the best.

72
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Where's your bracelet?

73
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,380
When I was leaving, I put it back in the box.

74
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,880
You should wear it. If you do, I'll feel more at ease.

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,210
It doesn't matter. These days, I rarely have nightmares.

76
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,180
Really?

77
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,300
You've worn it for so many years;

78
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,970
one day, suddenly you don't need it anymore.

79
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,370
- What? 
 - Nothing.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,320
Oh, by the way, I have one more thing to tell you.

81
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm getting ready to move back to Yangmei Lane.

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,210
-Was...wasn't that apartment sold?  
- -Yes, it was.

83
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,320
But the owner of the house is still planning to rent it out.

84
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,870
So I'm not being pushed out. I just met him.

85
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,440
If this new landlord pushes you out just like the last one, what will you do then?

86
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,160
He won't.

87
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,940
I signed a very special contract with this homeowner.

88
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,360
He won't turn me out. Don't worry.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,950
You just moved in and now you're you're leaving.

90
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,870
Do you really like the place that much?

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,060
That place isn't as nice as yours,

92
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,210
nor as comfortable.

93
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,490
But, I really have gotten used to it.

94
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,550
Besides, there...I have some very, very, very precious memories.

95
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,080
Brother, I'm just moving houses.

96
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,690
You don't need to treat it like we will never see each other again.

97
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,980
You can come see me whenever you feel like it.

98
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,410
And I can come over here to see you often.

99
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,380
But, I've grown up.

100
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,100
I can't always live at your house.

101
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,080
You can always live at my house.

102
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,640
Okay, okay.

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,210
Whenever you want to move, I'll help you.

104
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,180
Hello; I'm here to help Miss Anxin move houses.

105
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,060
Ai Li, I've caused you a lot of trouble today. Thank you so much.

106
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,880
It's nothing. It's my job.

107
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,930
President Ling planned to come personally today,

108
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,600
but suddenly, he had to go to a meeting. So...

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,430
Hadn't we agreed to do this move tomorrow. Why do it this suddenly?

110
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,760
It's almost like he's a little narrow-minded; of two minds.

111
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,450
Moving back sooner is because President Ling is on tenterhooks and wanted to get it done as soon as possible.

112
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,280
Then, I'll be going.

113
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,400
Be careful.

114
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,800
- Drive carefully. 
 - You don't need to see me off.

115
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,390
That's it for today's meeting.

116
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,140
If you don't have anything to add, we can end it.

117
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,430
What, Anxin?

118
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,490
Manager, I have a...

119
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,580
an idea that isn't fully formed that I'd like to get everyone's opinion about.

120
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Fine, then let's look at it together.

121
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,260
Okay; I'll hold everyone up a few more minutes.

122
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I'd like to make a story about 9-headed bird [a fabulous bird which used to be regarded as a bad omen] who enters the human world.

123
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,110
My inspiration comes from the 9 headed bird character in the Chinese "Classic of Mountains and Rivers".

124
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,060
"Classic of Mountains and Rivers"; the phoenix.

125
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,250
Because I think something can be combined with this traditional two-dimensional myth.

126
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,860
It can be stretched into new, modern circumstances.

127
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,510
I think we could try it out.

128
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,180
These are some new characters I've imagined.

129
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,290
There are also some broad idea outlines.

130
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,450
It doesn't seem like this style of drawing suits our company's audience.

131
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,840
That's true, but I think we could

132
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,970
try out Anxin's idea.

133
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,640
But, the audience for this kind of idea is very narrow.

134
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,970
Besides that, it doesn't really conform to the taste of today's youth.

135
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,990
Have you done marketing research?

136
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,180
Of course not. There's nothing in this sector.

137
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,980
Besides, these kinds of demonstration sketches are too crude.

138
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,880
Our company has indeed not used this kind of idea before.

139
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,680
But this theme is quite original.

140
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,970
It's not that we couldn't do it.

141
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,110
How about this. Anxin, right now,

142
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,270
come up with 10 more and we'll look at the results.

143
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,690
Can you do that?

144
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,210
I'd like to try it.

145
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,220
Ling Yue!

146
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,290
I have to work overtime today. You should go home.

147
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,820
Why do you have to work overtime again? Did your boss arrange more work for you?

148
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,510
No. I haven't finished the work I was supposed to do.

149
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,910
Then, how late will you be working?

150
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,250
I think it could be an all-nighter.

151
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,300
Don't wait for me. If you're down here waiting for me, I won't be able to focus on my work.

152
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,310
A young girl working until daybreak isn't safe.

153
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,280
It's fine. Our company's security is great.

154
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,630
What's great about it?  I can't see even one security officer.

155
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,480
Enough; you don't need to hang around. Go on back.

156
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,440
I'll wait for you to go in.

157
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,490
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

158
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,120
Why are you still here?  You didn't wait here all night, did you?

159
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,640
How could I do that?  Do I have that much free time?

160
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,390
Get in.

161
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,520
Here, eat some breakfast.

162
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,340
Have you eaten?

163
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,950
Eat it all.

164
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,150
I have to eat quickly. I have to go back when I finish eating.

165
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,140
You have to go back to work?

166
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,720
You can't sleep a little while?

167
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,730
How could I sleep?

168
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,460
I have a blanket in the car; sleep awhile.

169
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,930
You said you didn't wait for me. If you weren't waiting for me, where did this blanket come from?

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,180
You haven't realized who I am.

171
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,770
I am the best boyfriend.

172
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,940
My boyfriend is very cute.

173
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,450
I haven't brushed my teeth.

174
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,170
It's fine. I haven't brushed my teeth either.

175
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,910
<i>Gu Anxin. Why should you be so happy? <i></i></i>

176
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,550
<i> Gu Anxin, you can do this. </i>

177
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,290
<i> Don't panic. </i>

178
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,390
<i> [ranking list] </i>

179
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,120
I saw it. I can't believe Anxin is that awesome.

180
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,560
She just released number 19 and it's already at the top of the rankings online.

181
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,160
First time in history.

182
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,020
What? You can't even tell?

183
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,650
<i>It's obvious that she brought it.</i>

184
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,710
She brought it so that she can be ranked first?

185
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,760
No way! Normal people don't have the ability.

186
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,930
Of course normal people don't have the ability.

187
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,830
<i>The rumors are true?</i>

188
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,740
I heard the Boss reporting to the President of New Way today.

189
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,600
The numbers weren't even that high.

190
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,230
I didn't expect

191
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,410
that Anxin had such a backup.

192
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,780
What do you think then?

193
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,970
How did a rookie like her that doesn't know anything join our company then?

194
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,820
There's so many artists that couldn't even join.

195
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
She is a bit greedy.

196
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,640
but she insisted in wanting to be ranked first on the website.

197
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,850
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

198
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,310
Even though I'm a rookie, I won't buy numbers.

199
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,740
I will go investigate on this.

200
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,120
Hello, if you don't have an ID then you may not enter.

202
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,230
Then please help me notify that I'm looking for your President Ling.

203
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,560
Please give me your ID.

204
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Anxin?

205
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,740
You came just in time. Do you have an ID? They're not letting me enter.

206
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,300
I don't need it. I use my face.

207
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,200
What's going on with you two?

208
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,720
This is your future Lady Boss of New Way.

209
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,750
It's all his fault!

210
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,460
I told you to let the Lady Boss go in.

211
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,480
- When did you say that? 
 - What about it?

212
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,590
<i>What did I do?</i>

213
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,130
Let's talk alone.

214
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,000
You two may leave first.

215
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,710
What did you come? Did you miss me?

216
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,010
It's not convenient to say some things over the phone.

217
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,070
What words?

218
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,130
Was it your arrangement for me to join Jiang Group?

219
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,890
You already know?

220
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,240
the numbers were brought by you, right?

221
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,070
Yes.

222
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,870
I actually thought

223
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,060
as long as I keep trying

224
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,150
even if its slow or even slower,

225
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,900
I will eventually become a talented mangaka

226
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,880
using my own abilities,

227
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,820
but why did you let all this happen so quickly?

228
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm not qualified to have all this yet.

229
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,150
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

231
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,650
I just wanted you to focus on what you liked.

232
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,820
Even without me, you can use your abilities to join Jiang Group.

233
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,490
It's like your the cloud that helped me up to the sky.

234
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,680
The higher I fly, the higher I'll fall from. Don't you understand this logic?

235
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,660
Compared to secretly drawing at home

236
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Going to an honorable company to do what you like

237
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,200
isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

238
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,090
Honorable?

239
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,950
So you think...

240
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,000
getting a job that others never thought of and without having to do anything is considered honorable?

241
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,020
Besides, I never thought that secretly drawing mangas at home was never considered not honorable.

242
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,690
Is this embarrassing? Is it?

243
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,700
What you called honorable

244
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,600
ignored all my efforts.

245
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,680
That's right.

246
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,640
In your world,

247
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,470
you can even use feelings as a bargain chip for the stocks.

248
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,810
One thing is one thing. How is this related to the stocks?

249
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,970
I did all this for your own good.

250
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,560
Is it necessary for you to be so mad at me?

251
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,800
You think its not necessary, right?

252
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,070
Let's separate and calm down for some time.

253
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,390
Let's talk about other things later.

254
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,760
No, we can't separate. Not even a minute not a second.

255
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,960
I already said what needs to be said.

256
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,690
Can we talk it out?

257
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,590
Let's make things clear.

258
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,770
I already made it very clear.

259
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,510
You're the one who can't understand me.

260
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,440
Are you trying to detain me here?

261
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,010
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,880
I'm fine.

263
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,950
As long as you're fine.

264
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,610
I'll sit with you then.

265
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,830
It'll be find in a few days.

266
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,530
What right do you have to still come here?

267
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,490
I'm still Anxin's boyfriend. How do I not have the right?

268
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,890
You still dare to say that.

269
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,500
As her boyfriend, you let Anxin be this upset?

270
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,360
This is our issue.

271
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,450
What does it have to do with you?

272
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,980
Since I was young,

273
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,040
Anxin's issues are considered mines.

274
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,050
She's being upset over someone that's not worth it. I won't allow that to happen.

275
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,720
Then what do you want to do?

276
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,310
I will protect her.

277
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,620
If you can't give her happiness, then get lost.

278
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,880
Amazing!

279
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,520
<i>The higher I fly, the higher I'll fall down. Don't you understand this logic?</i>

280
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,610
<i>What you called honorable ignored all my efforts.</i>

281
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,660
- Amazing! 
 - You're so noisy!

282
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,670
God, please continue.

283
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,710
- Don't you need to go to school? 
 - It's the weekend today.

284
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,770
Can't you find something else to do?

285
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,460
Banhua originally asked me out to play games today

286
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,180
but he's mad at me so he went to tutoring.

287
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,490
You two are really alike then.

288
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,020
Chubby kid, make way. The adults are going to talk.

289
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,360
My mom said that this isn't being chubby.

290
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,550
It's bodybuilding.

291
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,300
Schwarzenegger.*(US actor and politician)

292
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,780
I knew that you would be here.

293
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,790
You're more and more like your dad now.

294
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,240
What do you mean?

295
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,420
Don't you're always annoyed by your dad's

296
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,310
arrangement to be the president and not giving your chances to prove yourself?

297
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,790
What's the difference from you arranging this for Anxin and your dad's arrangement?

298
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,760
You always say that Anxin is very stubborn.

299
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,370
She's so stubborn

300
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,140
yet you still dare to do that. You're really something.

301
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,200
That's not my intention.

302
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,240
Then your dad must have good intentions too.

303
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,000
<i>Anxin, the person that you're looking for is in the haunted Bishu Village recently. Her address is</i>

304
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,260
<i>No. 189 at Bishu Village, Ningyuan Town</i>

305
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,530
<i>Sorry, the caller that you're dialing is temporarily unavailable.</i>

306
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,710
- Alipay. 
 <i> - Okay.</i>

307
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:33,220
<i>Brother, I found Yu Guo. I'm going to Bishu Village. You don't need to pick me up at night.</i>

308
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,190
<i>Sorry, the caller that you're dialing is temporarily not within the area. Please call again later.</i>

309
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,240
Hello.

310
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,470
May I ask, have you seen Ms. Gu Anxin?

311
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,480
Anxin? She got off work early today and already left.

312
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,890
She left early? Did she mention where she's going?

313
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,130
She's visiting an old friend.

314
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,350
She's at Bishu Village.

315
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,750
Thank you.

316
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,680
President Ling, Yu Guo seems to be at Bishu Village.

317
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,800
Yu Guo, are you home?

318
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,300
Why are you here?

319
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,770
It's too dangerous for you to come here alone.

320
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,170
You don't need to bother about my business.

321
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,140
Wait a second.

322
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,830
Wait a second, okay?

323
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,340
Yu Guo, I'm coming in.

324
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,680
Yu Guo?

325
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,670
It's about to rain. Let's go back.

326
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,980
Her luggage is still here. She'll definitely come back.

327
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm going to wait for her over here.

328
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,130
What happens if she doesn't come back? Are you going to keep waiting for her?

329
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,030
Let's go.

330
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,990
It's about to rain. Hurry and get in the car.

331
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,360
It's not like I don't have legs. I can't walk by myself.

332
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,150
Are you sure? It takes 30 minutes to walk to the train station from here.

333
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,200
If it rains, then let it rain. It's not like I haven't been drenched before.

334
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,860
I know you're not afraid of getting drenched,

335
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,650
but your outfit is so see-through today. What happens if I see everything?

336
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,590
I'll do it myself.

337
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,490
Why are you hands so cold?

338
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,370
Do you feel better?

339
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,500
I already transferred the transportation fees to you.

340
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,930
We don't need to talk about money. I'm not accepting it.

341
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,500
I accepted it for you. If you don't accept it, then I won't ride your car.

342
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,230
Are you rich? Why do you always use money to solve problems?

343
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,890
I don't have money. I'm just copying the look and learning from some people.

344
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,880
The car has no gasoline and there's no gas station nearby.

345
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,590
I don't think this rain will stop any time soon.

346
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,900
If we don't want to spend the night in the wild, then we must have other plans.

347
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
Boss, sorry to interrupt.

348
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,090
Do you have a phone for us to borrow?

349
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,110
- Boss. 
 - Booking a room.

350
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,170
Welcome.

351
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,670
Boss, can we borrow your phone?

352
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,670
The heavy rain was so spontaneous.

353
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,540
<i>The signal isn't working. I can't even watch my live broadcast.</i>

354
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,920
- Does he not want us to borrow the phone? 
 - Seems like it.

355
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,980
If you couple want to talk, then do it in the room.

356
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,220
- We're not a couple. 
 - You're not?

357
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,670
Then why are you two so close?

358
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,960
Help us open two rooms.

359
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,570
Okay, one master bedroom.

360
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,710
No, its two rooms.

361
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,740
What a coincidence.

362
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,450
We only have a master bedroom left.

363
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,290
Impossible that only one is left.

364
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:23,200
It doesn't seem like many people are here or full.

365
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,850
- Why don't we go to another place? 
 - Okay.

366
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,010
Go ahead.

367
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,210
Look several hundred miles around this small area.

368
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,050
And see if this is the only shop.

369
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,550
I'm afraid that the master bedroom would be gone by the time you guys come back.

370
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,380
One bedroom then.

371
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,400
Okay.

372
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,370
Hotels are like this nowadays.

373
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,270
They always like to do weird things.

374
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,820
Why are you getting that for?

375
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,930
<i>[Super Thin]</i>

376
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,540
Put up with it tonight.

377
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,170
But there's only one bed here.

378
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,090
- Why don't─ 
 - We can't.

379
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,670
We can't what?

380
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,240
I meant why don't I sleep on the floor and you sleep on the bed?

381
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,160
What? You want to sleep with me?

382
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,080
As if!

383
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,370
Hurry and go shower. Don't catch a cold.

384
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,300
Got it.

385
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,940
<i>[Clean Living]</i>

386
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,760
I already helped you blow dry your clothes.

387
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,390
Thank you.

388
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,430
Let's sleep early. Hurry and go shower.

389
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,580
- Sit down. 
 - What's wrong?

390
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,640
Your hair is all wet. You'll catch a cold if you sleep like that.

391
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,050
What are you doing?

392
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,830
There's a cockroach!

393
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,290
The cockroach can't run as fast as you.

394
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,720
Are you comparing me to a cockroach?

395
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,630
Okay, go down and sleep. It's dead.

396
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,030
I already smashed it. It's gone.

397
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
You sleep on the floor then.

398
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,900
I'll sleep then.

399
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,700
Okay, you can sleep on the bed,

400
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,190
but I have to create a border that we can't cross.

401
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,900
We'll sleep on our own sides, understand?

402
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,410
This is the border.

403
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,480
You can only sleep on that side and I can only sleep on my side.

404
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,240
Do you understand?

405
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,790
Goodnight.

406
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,260
Since we already slept together─

407
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,470
Why are you so unconcerned when talking?

408
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,090
What do you mean by "We already slept together." This is called,

409
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,370
"Using a bed together."

410
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,100
Okay.

411
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,260
Since we already used a bed together,

412
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,070
then can you forgive me for what I did before?

413
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,420
Did you say that everything can be solved after a sleep?

414
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,720
I really don't know where you learned these words.

415
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,740
Answer me first.

416
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,200
You're making me forgive you, but do you know where you were at fault?

417
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,410
I know. I thought about it a lot these past few days.

418
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,570
Look at me.

419
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,540
I shouldn't of interfered with your issues.

420
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,950
I forgot to think about how you felt

421
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,790
regarding the 5%, leaving you,

422
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,870
and the job arrangement.

423
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,420
These are all actions of not respecting you.

424
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,100
<i>I thought that doings these were for your own good,</i>

425
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,790
but I never asked what you needed.

426
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,460
I won't interfere with your issues in the future.

427
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,430
I will love you using the method that you want.

428
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,790
Are you willing to give me more time to learn?

429
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,470
Why are you laughing?

430
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,120
You never said

431
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,490
so many words in one go.

432
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,880
It's like you're writing an essay now.

433
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,960
Promise me first.

434
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,320
I actually calmed down and thought about it.

435
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,780
We're from two difference words after all.

436
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,960
<i>There will be different opinions.</i>

437
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,670
Just like how I like to eat roasted sweet potatoes, but you say that its unsanitary.

438
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,060
I don't think that way right now.

439
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,200
What I meant is that even if its like that,

440
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,940
its still fine.

441
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,580
As long as its for our own good from the start,

442
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,760
then I'll try my best to understand you in the future.

443
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,500
We have to communicate when anything happens

444
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,120
and be honest with each other, okay?

445
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,430
Okay.

446
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,030
We don't need this border then, right?

447
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,960
Since we made up, then we don't need it.

448
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,700
Okay then, but you have to promise me

449
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,070
that you can't do that "Hm" thing.

450
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,360
What "Hm" thing?

451
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,680
It's...

452
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,390
Nothing. If you don't understand, then forget it.

453
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,290
Okay.

454
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,830
Anxin!

455
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,560
Anxin!

456
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,150
Anxin!

457
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,500
<i>The money has been transferred to your account. Immediately move somewhere else to live. Don't act impulsively.</i>

458
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,230
<i>I understand.</i>

459
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,920
You said that you wouldn't do anything.

460
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,800
You started it.

461
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,230
Weren't you already asleep?

462
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,100
You kept moving around that I ended up waking up.

463
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,230
Impossible. I was moving very quietly.

464
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,930
If I don't hug my entire world, then how can I sleep?
