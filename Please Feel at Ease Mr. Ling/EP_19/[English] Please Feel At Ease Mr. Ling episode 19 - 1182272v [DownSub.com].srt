- Did he order them today? 
 - Oh, no.

A few days ago, Mr. Ling Sheng bought you an annual subscription to the company's group order service.

It provides you with exclusive snacks and fruits on schedule.

- Will President Sheng be coming today? 
 - No.

I was just about to tell you that before he left, President Sheng

44

These were all taken by President Sheng himself.

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,830
In fact, President Sheng specifically told us

50
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,220
not to tell you. He was afraid it would disrupt your work.

51
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,820
Okay, I understand.

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,540
President Ling, you must be joking. Who in this field doesn't know your capability?

57
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,020
Your interest in collaborating with us is our honor.

58
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,890
I'd be eager to pay even more.

59
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,540
President Ling, when you announce your Lingxiao Plan at an event as grand as the e-commerce summit meeting,

60
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,050
I'm sure it will be the focus of millions.

61
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,090
I look forward to seeing New Way's performance.

62
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,500
Thank you for your trust. Rest assured,

63
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,380
- I will not let you down. 
 - Of course.

64
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
Happy collaboration.

65
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,170
President Ling, I hear New Way has already received financing for its newest project. Is that true?

66
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,930
That's correct. For a project that New Way has not yet announced,

67
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,200
we have already received one billion yuan in the first round of financing.

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Included are distribution, property,

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,440
Internet, and hundreds of other leading enterprises in different domains.

70
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,020
New Way's new project will promote development in all areas.

71
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,120
I have full confidence that our shareholders will receive  a rich repayment.

72
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,590
Did I wake you up?

73
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,900
Anxin, how come you're here?

74
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,440
I missed you, so I came.

75
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,050
I brought you a bento. Do you want to see it?

76
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,280
You made it so cute, I feel bad eating it.

77
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,580
If you perform well in the future, I'll give you a reward.

78
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,750
Because I have the only secret book.

79
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,510
Where did you learn this from?

80
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,570
When I was little, my brother and I would give each other rewards like this.

81
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,470
Then I want to eat this everyday from now on.

82
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,460
What would be special about it if you ate it everyday?

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
I didn't put any vinegar in it,

84
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,020
but some people seem to eat a lot of vinegar. 
 <i>("Eat vinegar" means to be jealous)</i>

85
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,040
Why is that?

Don't be unhappy.

87
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,200

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,630
It looks so advanced and convenient.

90
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,920
This is the original motive I had in establishing New Way.

91
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I always hoped that one day,

92
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,880
I could use real technology to make people's lives easier.

93
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,340
Your way of thinking is so awesome.

94
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,280
This has always been my dream.

95
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,040
But now that it's going to be released,

96
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,610
I feel a little nervous and uneasy.

97
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,960
Ling Yue, not everyone can find a goal to fight for.

98
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,440
But you've found your goal, and you're fighting for it.

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,490
And you've done so well.

100
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,260
You are the star of good fortune itself.

101
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,620
So don't think about anything.

102
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,400
Just bravely go and do it.

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,310
At worst, I'll provide for you.

104
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,060
Then I'll count on you to provide for me.

105
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,820
Okay!

106
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,490
President Ling.

107
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,230
Look at this.

108
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,880
Our Gu Group is currently reconsidering B2C (business to consumer) operations.

109
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,520
At the same time, we are in the process of remodeling our distribution value.

110
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,500
We have formed exclusive partnerships with with many famous domestic companies.

111
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,780
We will be the first in the country to register our 5G+ distribution warehouse business.

112
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,670
The Anxing Plan we have advanced

113
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,530
will lead the new structure of the e-commerce era.

114
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,730
This Anxing Plan, whether considering the marketing standpoint or the central technology,

115
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,370
is exactly the same as our Lingxiao Plan.

116
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,160
Has there been any trend on the side of the Lingxiao Plan?

117
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
A majority of the investors have already begun to withdraw their capital.

118
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,580
Hold an urgent meeting. Start up the first degree warning plan.

119
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,410
President Gu, after the Plan A was implemented

120
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,550
the Gu stocks have risen aggressively.

121
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,640
The closing rate has grown by 20%, and our Inn can benefit as well.

122
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,630
He's already chosen a dangerous path.

123
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,610
We'll have to see if the following effect can match predictions.

124
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,840
As of yesterday and today, we have lost 20 million.

125
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,010
Of the companies under us, 20 face bankruption.

126
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,140
Our stocks are at its lowest since 2015.

127
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,360
We've just received large amounts of order cancellations from our collaborative businesses, including President Wang.

128
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,210
Many investors have decided to pull out.

129
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,020
Even the Ling Group's stock prices have suffered varying levels of decrease.

130
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,820
The Group's Board of Directors and Board of Supervisors have all arrived. Things are not going well.

131
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,680
That's right. Overnight, our investors have withdrawn more than 100 million in investments.

132
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,710
Stocks are plummeting now. So scary.

133
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,600
As the person managing the company, you made the incorrect decision in your plan against Ling Xiao

134
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,190
and inadequately managed potential dangers, leading to great losses for the company.

135
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,720
The Group's Board of Directors have decided

136
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,880
to temporarily withdraw your authority over New Way.

137
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,130
This unfortunate decision was made in consideration of the company's future development.

138
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,860
After the meeting, the stockholders have the right to limit your company's email,

139
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,370
server, import and export, as well as the mobile information within your work.

140
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,590
New Way has not reached the point of no return.

141
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,050
You want me to throw away New Way to save myself. Was this the old man's orders?

142
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,850
No. This was the entire Board of Director's decision.

143
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,860
This was also after our strict risk assessment.

144
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,350
We all believe this is the best way of decreasing risk at the moment.

145
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,120
President Ling, only by throwing away the small things can the greater good be saved.

146
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,250
Don't hurt the entire Group's benefit for just New Way.

147
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,090
Anxin! Anxin! Come look.

148
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,130

149
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,960

I'll use my side account to counter for you.

153
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,100
You can't respond to all these attacks one by one.

154
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,120
You'll just end up causing more negative consequences.

155
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,170
Right now, the most important thing is finding the attacker's origin and goal.

156
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,350
That origin could quite possibly be the Gu Group.

157

170
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,700
No. I'm just too busy.

171
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,870
There really isn't? You've lost weight.

172
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,760
Don't worry. It's really nothing.

173
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,440
Then go take a bath and sleep early.

174
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,110
Ok.

175
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,990
<i>That origin could quite possibly be Gu Group.</i>

176
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,630
<i>After all, if the Ling family falls, they receive the greatest benefit.</i>

177
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:08,020
Hi Brother, just at the Evolution Coffee Shop we often go to.

178
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,650
Ok. See you then.

179
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,090
<i>[Evolution]</i>

180
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,100
We...haven't seen each other in a long time.

181
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,520
Brother. Are you really attacking New Way?

182
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,010
You came to see me because of him?

183
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,390
To tell you the truth, yes. I really do want to destroy New Way.

184
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,570
If it wasn't for him, the person standing next to you would be me.

185
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,290
-Why are you doing this?
-Why?

186
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,320
Why do you think I won't do this?

187
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,020
Because I trust that you aren't someone who would do something like this.

188
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Anxin. I don't want such trust.

189
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,190
Your trust has given me pain for too long.

190
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,080
I only want you back by my side. Ok?

191
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,620
Ling Yue cannot hang on for much longer. I will give you everything you want.

192
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,580
Brother...these are two different matters.

193
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,910
Even if Ling Yue has nothing, I will still stay by his side.

194
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,460
Do I not even have a chance?

195
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,290
In my heart, you've always been my closest relative, my brother.

196
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,400
Only that.

197
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,270
Stop fighting with Ling Yue.

198
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,990
Anxin.

199
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,420
There's no regret in each chess piece movement.*(No regret for any action)

200
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,090
Ling Yue's current situation can only be blamed on his incorrect judgment. No one else is to blame.

201
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,650
If that's so,

202
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,420
then I hope you won't act brashly.

203
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,730
And turn into someone you don't even recognize.

204
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm leaving.

205
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,810
<i>So no matter how many times this person hurts you!</i>

206
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,700
<i>As long as he needs you, you will run to him without abandon?</i>

207
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,450
<i>Then have you ever thought that</i>

208
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,410
<i>I also need you.</i>

209
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,690
<i>I'm sorry, Brother. I'm a little lost right now.</i>

210
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,320
<i>Let's both calm down...</i>

211
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,150
<i>Why must I always leave the person I love?</i>

212
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,390
<i>I can't give you happiness?</i>

213
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,190
<i>I'm also warning you. Anxin is mine.</i>

214
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,980
<i>I will take care of her.</i>

215
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,950
<i>Brother!</i>

216
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,260
Ling Yue.

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,220
New Way's current dilemma is a result of the market's strong suppress weak situation.

218
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,860
I know you don't feel good losing,

219
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,350
but I never thought you would have Anxin come talk to me.

220
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,160
Anxin really went to find you?

221
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,230
You don't need to pretend with me.

222
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,260
Ling Yue, I will use all of my strength to defeat you.

223
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,280
You can't win.

224
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,720
<i>I am Gu Anxin's brother.</i>

225
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,890
<i>What do you want to explain?</i>

226
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,350
<i>Explain how you're wavering between my two sisters?</i>

227
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,980
<i>-Brother!
</i>-<i>Let's go.</i>

228
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,700
<i>Don't-</i>

229
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,550
<i>This President Ling claims he wants to see you.</i>

230
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,310
<i>Is it really nothing or do you have something to hide? You know what it is.</i>

231
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,180
<i>If you let her get hurt one more time, </i>

232
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,160
<i>I will take her back.</i>

233
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,320
Next, we have reached our e-commerce conference's climax.

234
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,440
Let us welcome the founder of Plan An,

235
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,250
the CEO of Gu Group, Mister Gu Ansheng,

236
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,690
to introduce this plan to us.

237
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,560
<i>[Plan An]</i>

238
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,290
Everyone, I believe you have seen all you need to know about our Plan A across all the media platforms.

239
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,460
I won't speak more of our plan's pros and cons.

240
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,480
All I can say now is

241
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,890
the opening for investments is no longer big. Very soon,

242
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,390
the Gu Group will become the largest company in this country's e-commerce business.

243
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,420
President Gu speaks of bold claims.

244
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,090
Ling Yue?

245
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,440
-Why did he come?
-I heard New Way's in danger from recent incidents,

246
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,060
but it doesn't seem so just looking at him.

247
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,300
Is there going to be a turn around?

248
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Young President Gu,

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
is widely divergent from the Gu Group's

250
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
usual boring style. I admire that.

251
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,100
Don't worry. I came today, because I think New Way's innovation ideal

252
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,200
and Gu Group's 5G plan are identical.

253
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,300
Our New Way will wholeheartedly support Gu Group's Plan A.

254
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,500
And will open up collaboration both online and off.

255
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
President Ling, do you mean that

256
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,200
New Way will give up on their current 5G proposal

257
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
and invest in a similar proposal under the Gu Group?

258
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Earlier, it was rumored that New Way will sue Gu Group,

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,400
because Gu Group's Plan A violates the rights of New Way's unannounced project.

260
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Those are all rumors. You media should be most clear about that.

261
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,200
Remember! In the market,

262
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
there are no everlasting enemies.

263
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,600
I have high hopes for Gu Group's Plan A. New Way will support it with all out strength.

264
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
A plan that even the Ling Group speaks highly of must have unlimited potential.

265
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,200
However, if we want to fight for this fresh piece of meat, we must speed up our steps.

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Ling Yue, what tricks are you playing again?

267
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Speaking of tricks...President Gu is the master.

268
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Since you've lost, isn't it better to leave respectably?

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,600
Won't this...make it harder for you?

270
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,400
The final result hasn't been released yet, and President Gu has declared himself victor.

271
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm afraid it's too early.

272
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Could you have a way to win everything back?

273
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,200
How do you know I can't? Anyways,

274
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,300
even if New Way loses, we lost honorably.

275
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,400
As for you, you only used various excuses and changed your name.

276
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,800
You've announced what was originally New Way's Heaven Reaching Plan.

277
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Even the core technology is identical.

278
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Stealing all these things before New Way's announcement.

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,400
President Gu sure has considered everything.

280
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,060
Hey, maintain a smile.

281
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,200
So much media are looking at us.

282
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,600
Don't worry.

283
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,940
As long as you have the will to work with me,

284
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,600
many people will believe your Gu Group.

285
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,510
Steal.

286
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,400
This word is more suitable for you, President Ling.

287
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Don't think there's nothing you, Ling Yue, can't steal.

288
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,500
If at the time I...confessed to Anxin first,

289
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,200
do you think you'd still have a chance?

290
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,700
You have no right to mention Anxin.

291
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,200
If you think Anxin's rejection is because you were late a step,

292
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,800
then you are insulting Anxin.

293
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,300
You have no right to have her.

294
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,800
From today on,

295
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,400
in both work and relationship,

296
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,320
I will not lose to you because I was late a step.

297
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
What is mine...I will

298
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
take it back bit by bit.

299
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
Then you have to speed up,

300
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,800
or else

301
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,600
you might not be able to withstand what's coming.

302
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,700
I'll fight you to the end.

303
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,900
President Liu.

304
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,600
Do you not owe me an explanation?

305
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,100
When you proposed this 5G plus a logistics warehouse to me,

306
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't think you mentioned this was New Way's project.

307
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,200
President Ling, why didn't you directly say to the media that the Gu Group stole our plan?

308
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
We haven't announced this plan before.

309
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,800
The lawsuit will be hard to win. The Gu Group haven't entered capital yet.

310
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Even if we proved they violated our rights, there won't be any true impact.

311
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Then...it seems you already know how to make a true impact.

312
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Do you remember the Xuefei Technology in charge of Heaven Reaching Plan's video messaging technology?

313
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,600
I remember.

314
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,020
At the time, we wanted to buy their technology at a high price.

315
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,000
But the discussion was never settled.

316
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
That's right.

317
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,800
The only reason he wasn't willing to sell us the technology was because he never planned on selling it.

318
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,400
He is someone who views ownership of his own technology as extremely important. He definitely won't sell it to anyone.

319
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,000
So...the Gu Group couldn't have convinced them and implemented the plan so quickly.

320
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,200
Unless...Gu Ansheng doesn't know this technology belongs to Xuefei.

321
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,500
That's right.

322
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,600
If President Liu wants implement Plan An in a short amount of time, then he must withhold Xuefei's situation from Gu Ansheng.

323
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Ling Yue is no threat to us.

324
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,200
You only need to welcome future profits.

325
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Us Gu Group only wants steady development.

326
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,600
Not to draw enemies or invite trouble.

327
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
President Gu, I promise you.

328
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
The Gu Group will be the greatest winner.

329
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Right now, if New Way supports them, it will definitely peak Xuefei's interest.

330
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,600
Xuefei can then sue Gu Group

331
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,200
saying they stole business secrets. By that time...

332
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,400
By that time, it'll be hard for Gu Group to defend themselves.

333
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Counter someone with their methods.

334
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
I just don't want him to have the ability to counterattack.

335
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,200
President Gu, after the e-commerce conference we've received word from many investors.

336
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,500
They all hope to collaborate with us.

337
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
So quickly?

338
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,200
They've all seen the future of Plan An.

339
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Alright. Go plan it, and I will see them personally.

340
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
Ok.

341
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Hello.

342
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
President Gu, bad news.

343
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,650
One of the technologies within Plan A violates rights.

344
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,800
Last night, the related company has sued us.

345
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Also, the media has already reported it this morning, and the internet has related evidence.

346
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,600
It seems like a well planned chain of events.

347
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,400
Technology violation?

348
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
How can that be? There shouldn't be a problem with our project implementation.

349
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Where's President Liu right now?

350
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
We haven't been able to contact him.

351
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,400
The investors are all trying to withdraw investment, but this batch of investments have already been placed into production.

352
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,200
What should we do now?

353
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Wait until I'm there. I'll head over now.

354
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
The Gu Group that obtained endless glory from Plan A

355
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
has suffered a plummet in stocks due to reports of fraudulent technology.

356
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,800
And due to various cases of deceiving customers, a loophole in supply,

357
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,200
problems with quality and safety, the Gu Group is endangered.

358
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,400
The opposing company claims Plan A involves a large amount of technology stealing and has revealed related evidence.

359
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
They also claim Gu Group has stolen their creation. Can you respond to this?

360
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,000
The Gu Group's stocks has suffered greatly since this morning.

361
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,800
Is this because Gu Group will find it difficult to deal with this situation?

362
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,100
-Then what about the money put in by investors?
-That's right, President Gu!

363
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,400
Please respond, President Gu!

364
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
President Gu! Does Gu Group have lawyer statement? President Gu!

365
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,600
President Gu! President Gu, please respond! President Gu!

366
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
How will Gu Group face-

367
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,000
Where's my brother?

368
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,400
The media and investors have surrounded the company entrance to ask that Gu Group repay their investments.

369
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Right now, President Gu can only live in a hotel and can't reveal himself publicly.

370
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,800
No pictures! No pictures!

371
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
-No pictures!
-Please respond.

372
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
No pictures! No pictures!

373
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,100
President Ling, the Gu Group's stocks have been frozen for 5 business days. Should we continue following?

374
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,600
Continue.

375
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,300
I understand.

376
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,600
Let's go and eat!

377
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,000
-Let's go!
-Time to eat...

378
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
It's up to you then!

379
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,040
What's wrong? Is there something you forgot again?

380
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Do you have business with me?

381
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Of course I have business with you.

382
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
The Gu Group's stocks have been frozen...

383
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,200
What? Something as major as this and you're together with Ling Yue everyday.

384
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,400
You're pretending you don't know?

385
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Ling Yue's been busy recently, and I haven't seen him in many days. What's the situation?

386
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
New Way's attacked and completely impacted Gu Group.

387
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,200
My brother's been heavily impacted.

388
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,600
He's like a zombie everyday and can't even return home.

389
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
Gu Group's almost over too.

390
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
How is it? Are you happy now?

391
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
You've had your revenge. Are you satisfied now?

392
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
What revenge?

393
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
I told you I'm not aware of this matter!

394
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Stop pretending to be a good person.

395
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,000
If it wasn't for you,

396
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
would my brother and Ling Yue be fighting like this?

397
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
If it wasn't for you rejecting my brother,

398
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
would he risk everything to fight with Ling Yue?

399
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Everything is because of you.

400
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Gu Anxin, I advise you.

401
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,600
Don't affect two businesses because of one person's feelings.

402
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
The Gu Group's lost so much market value overnight.

403
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,400
How many people's sweat and efforts have gone to waste?

404
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,300
You have no right.

405
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,800

409
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,700
There's no place for me to hide.

410

411
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,160
Didn't we say this was a big slice of cake? How did it turn out this way?

412
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,890
It's definitely a big slice of cake

413
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,180
but it must be eaten slowly so that we don't choke.

414
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,650
Director Liu, you are too anxious.

415
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,060
Boss, what do we do next?

416
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,010
I planned to implicate Gu Ansheng with New Way.

417
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,870
I didn't expect that Ling Yue would avoid the trap and it brought down Gu Group instead.

418
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,330
But it's not without any gains. Don't be lax and keep monitoring.

419
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,070
Understood.

420
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,650

421
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,620
I have been too busy lately and didn't come home often.

422
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,530
You won't blame me?

423
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,170
Why have you been so busy lately?

424
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,990
Is there a problem at the company?

425
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,940
It's fine. Work's almost done.

426
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,350
What about your Ling Xiao plan? How is it going?

427
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,920
Not bad. The progress is going without hitches.

428
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,820
That's all?

429
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,520

430
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,730
What else are you hiding from me?

431
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,390
Gusheng came to see me.

432
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,160
If he didn't tell me,

433
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,040
I wouldn't have known you are so inflexible.

434
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,200
It's common to have competition in the market. Things are not that simple as you think.

435
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,070
But you could have told me.

436
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,280
I didn't want you to worry.

437
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,670
I can worry about you. I'm willing to worry about you.

438
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:13,030
If every time when you are in a helpless situation and I have to find out from someone else,

439
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,230
who am I to you then?

440

442

about you interrogating me,

444
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,120
being partial to him? How could I not care?

445
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,270
Gu Ansheng brought this upon himself because he messed with me first.

446
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:55,480
Ling Yue, I think there must be some misunderstanding.

447
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,260
What's your confirmation based on?

448
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,270
Taking into account that I have known him for many years.

449
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,130
Yes.

450
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,390
You have known him for many years.

451

Yes, I can't be compared to him.

452
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,040
So, you think I'm asking you about this because I'm protecting him?

453
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,690
Isn't that so? Aren't you believing what he said and feel bad about him?

454
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,880
If we have known each other for a long time

455
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
and we are now caught in-between by someone,

456

If this is what you think, I have nothing to say.

459
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,580
President Ling, Gu Group's shares are now at the lower limit.

460
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,510
The investors withdrew their funds. The company assets have depreciated by around 40 percent.

461

Many years ago, my father did the paternity test at this hospital.

476
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,580
But I think there's a problem with the paternity test.

In fact, I thought there was a problem with the link.

509
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,190
Thanks.

510
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,450
Take it that you have a conscience for knowing my taste.

511
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Teacher, were you always working at Maria's First Hospital in the past?

512
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,500
That's right. Isn't there where I first met you, Little Rascal?

513
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,480
You were the intern then and most gifted.

514
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,090
You were also the one who dared to take on hardships.

515
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,180
You taught me well.

516
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,630
Teacher, someone entrusted me to ask you about something.

517
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,350
There's something I would like to ask you.

518
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,960
Speak.

519
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,810
I have a friend, Gu Anxin.

520
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,640
She did a paternity test here

521
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
but she feels there's a mistake.

522
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,050
Thus, I would like to ask if you have any impression of this.

523
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,840
Gu Anxin?

524
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,360
That's right.

525
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,090
Generally speaking, if there's was misdiagnosis,

526
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,910
I would have an impression.

527
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,750
Gu Anxin?

528
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,270
I don't seem to have any impression.

529
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,940
Okay. If you recall anything,

530
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,040
please let me know. This is...

531
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,400
very important to her.

532
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,950
Okay.

533
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,760
Teacher, I'm leaving now.

534
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,360
Your fans broke the ten thousand record.

535
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,580
It's time for me to let this agent take the stage. Is anyone secretly shooting?

536
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,110
n

537
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,740
I think this is the charm of a good assistant.

538
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,070
- He doesn't think so.
- Are you both still fighting?

539
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,680
What's up, Doctor Xiao?

540
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,260
Regarding your paternity test,

541
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,040
I have been following up on it

542
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,060
and discovered some doubts. Is Yu Gao your classmate who was injured then?

543
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,330
Yes. Her name is Yu Gao.

544
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,320
<i>[Maria's First Hospital. Results of Patient Yu Guo]</i>

545
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,010
<i>[Conclusion : Exclusive amount of alprazolam in the blood, serious allergy]</i>

546
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,960
What's the meaning of this?

547
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,690
Yu Gao's injury wasn't due to a fall from a high place?

548
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,940
It's part of the reason for the injury

549
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,930
however, the main reason for the disability of the patient

550
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,860
is due to the detection of alprazolam in her blood

551
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,380
which led to severe damage to the nerves in her arm.

552
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,920
Then...this is to say...

553
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,080
This is to say, my teacher falsified Yu Gao's report.

554
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,960
I don't quite understand.

555
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,260
Why did he do this? There's no feud between us.

556
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,720
I didn't understand too.

557
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,850
Hence, when I found this case study of patient's report,

558
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,330
I went to my teacher's office.

559
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,470
He has a habit of recording his patients.

560
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,390
I found this audio file which is related to Yu Guo's report.

561
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,010
<i>Dr Jiang, you must help me regarding Yu Guo.</i>

562
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,780
<i>I can't.</i>

563
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,190
<i>You are involved in forging the report of Gu Anxin's paternity test too.</i>

564
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,740
<i>You forced me to do this.</i>

565
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,990
<i>You were negligent in your final analysis.</i>

566
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,770
<i>If this were to be exposed, you should the consequences.</i>

567
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,140
<i>As long as you help me for this,</i>

568
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,040
<i>regarding Gu Anxin's paternity report,</i>

569
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,380
<i>it will be like a rock sunk into the bottom of the ocean.</i>

570
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,340
Yang Hong.

571
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,210
<i>We are family. No need to be formal.</i>

572
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,370
<i>Your mother is my good friend.</i>

573
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,920
<i>I'm responsible for this too.</i>

574
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,520
<i>It's normal for you to blame me.</i>

575
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,740
Yang Hong and Teacher Jiang Tao were working together in the Department of Hematology.

576
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,030
She knew Teacher Jiang Tao was in-charge of your paternity test.

577
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,740
She secretly dropped this blood sample.

578
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,330
There was a problem with the paternity test.

579
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,520
That's how my mom eventually turned out like that.

580
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,650
Yang Hong's father was Teacher Jiang Tao's mentor.

581
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,900
When Yu Gao had an accident,

582
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,980
Teacher Jiang Tao happened to be promoted to Associate Doctor.

583
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,790
Yang Hong used the error in the paternity test and his promotion to threaten him.

584
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,590
He tampered with Yu Guo's case report

585
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,650
and pushed the reason for her disability to the staircase incident.

586
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,180
Why did he do this to me?

587
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,360
Madam, Miss Anxin's looking for you.

588
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,990
Anxin is here? Let her in.

589
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,050
Anxin is here.

590
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,070
It has been a long time. I miss you.

591
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,060
Come in and take a seat.

592
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,650
Auntie, I don't have any other matters today.

593
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,620
I merely want to verify certain matters with you.

594
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,330
What are they?

595
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,300
Do you still remember Doctor Jiang?

596
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,280
I met Doctor Jiang a long time ago

597
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,710
but we haven't been in contact.

598
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,150
The DNA report that he did for me,

599
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,370
had a problem with it. Do you know about this?

600
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,620
Problem with the paternity report?

601
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,240
I really have no idea.

602
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,490
Because I trust my mother.

603
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,270
She wouldn't do anything to wrong my father.

604
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,960
However, if the paternity report is wrong,

605
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,430
it clearly means that someone forged the report.

606
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,340
Or perhaps, the blood sample was swopped.

607
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,600
This happened a long time ago.

608
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,730
Anxin, I have this piece of advice for you.

609
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,980
Who hasn't been young once? Who hasn't made mistakes?

610
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,770
That's right.

611
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,820
Why should the younger generation be embroiled

612
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,360
with matters that happened in the previous generation?

613
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,380
Your father is just being stubborn

614
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,300
but he's worried about you.

615
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,310
Ever since your mother passed away,

616
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:41,060
we hope to treat you as our biological daughter

617
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,460
and give you whatever you want.

618
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,240
We hope you will live well.

619
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,410
Auntie Hong, I know

620
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,600
you treated me well for the past years.

621
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,850
Including when you treated me well with Xin'er when we were in school.

622
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,010
I remember this.

623
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,330
By the way, Auntie, do you still remember Yu Guo?

624
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,780
I don't have any impression. Who is she?

625
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,940
My schoolmate who had an accident then.

626
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,310
Ever since she showed up at the Gu family's banquet and disappeared after that,

627
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,000
I found some schoolmates to investigate this.

628
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,100
Some found a video evidence in their cellphones

629
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,840
which can prove that accident

630
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,730
was not related to me.

631
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,000
Of course, it's good to have new evidence.

632
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,990
Moreover,  I have always believed that it was unintentional.

633
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,710
However, this happened a long time ago.

634
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,360
Don't keep dwelling on this.

635
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,330
One should look forward instead.

636
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,420
If we still haven't figured out the past,

637
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,480
how can we look forward?

638
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,090
This is not what I meant.

639
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,290
Aren't you and Ling Yue doing well now?

640
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,530
Of course, Ling Yue and you are free to fall in love with each other. I don't have the rights to interfere

641
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,000
however,

642
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,000
taking into account that you and Xin'er are sisters,

643
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,530
can you not make it hard for her?

644
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,140
Of course, if you have problems,

645
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,240
I can still help.

646
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,510
I like you very much. I will still help you.

647
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,470
It's not easy for a girl to be out there alone.

648
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,680
Auntie, don't worry.

649
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,210
Ling Yue and I are doing well.
