22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,220
how are you two doing?

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,920
all good now

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,980
how did you find me?

25
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,570
we caught Lingyue, lets meet in half an hour

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,240
we have seen him before a few times

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,450
probably someone is in trouble and called him to clean up

28
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,910
Follow him.

29
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,590
what about it? I came just in time

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,980
like a super hero

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,890
thank you, brother

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,920
thank me? I didn't come to save you

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,050
only i'm allowed to pick on you

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,770
then be nicer to your brother, stop plotting against him

35
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,890
that was just a misunderstanding

36
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,950
i originally did want to do something...

37
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,750
who would have known those two idiots couldn't even open the car door

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,220
after looking around came back

39
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,930
he switched lanes, do you think he noticed us?

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,640
not you?

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,120
When president Ling went missing, security cameras caught his car also in the parking lot

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
why didn't you tell me earlier

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,840
i didn't know the my car would have that

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,050
Lingsheng!

45
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,160
no, impossible

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,660
when the cooperation plan for the anniversary event was leaked to Gu company

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,350
I already know there was a spy in our company

48
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,290
and a while ago the conflict between New Way and Gu Shi company

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,340
was also by a company employee leaking the Ling Xiao plan

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,490
when I signed that document...

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,590
although it did not reveal the name

52
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,820
but it had our father's signature stamp

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,350
the stamp was in our family safe

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,750
and only Lingsheng could open

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,940
and only he could have both the cooperation plan and Ling Xiao plan

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,200
thats true

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,090
he was meeting with company shareholders and our head managers lately

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,730
when Allen kidnapped Anxin

59
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,730
I thought this might have something to do with him

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,230
Anxin

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,440
Brother?

62
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,530
how did this happen?

63
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,530
why are you here?

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,520
you awake?

65
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,740
Yuguo, how are you feeling?

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,600
tell us, who is your accomplice

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,530
kill me then

68
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,900
Yuguo, stop lying to yourself

69
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,680
we were there together and the gas was leaked

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,350
if it wasn't for Lingfang, we would have really died

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,000
no way... she wouldn't

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,070
Yuguo

73
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,050
that person you speak of

74
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,590
is she, Yanghong?

75
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,530
child don't be afraid

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,530
from now on, i'm your family

77
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,900
from now on I will take care of you

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,320
Auntie Hong, you are so nice to me

79
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,740
I wouldn't know how to repay you

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm just trying to atone in place of Anxin

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,960
she is my adoptive daughter, our whole family has wronged you

82
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,550
slowly, don't rush

83
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,490
don't blame yourself

84
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,560
blame those who harmed you

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,990
karma will make them pay

86
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,370
so you already aware

87
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,710
I saw my mothers accounting books

88
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,740
she had been transferring money to Yuguo

89
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,840
so I started to have suspicion

90
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,840
so to force Lingyue to sign over equity rights and get rid of you two

91
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,890
it's killing two birds with one stone

92
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,770
sign over equity, to whom?

93
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,620
Lingsheng

94
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,980
my mother has already set a date for Lingsheng and Xiner's wedding

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,060
we don't have any evidence right now

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,550
to take them to court

97
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,950
you guys go back, pretend we are really dead

98
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,820
I will secretly arrange someone to collect evidence

99
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,120
be careful not to be caught

100
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,600
it can only be this way

101
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,030
we can stall for some time

102
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,950
go ahead, what can brother help you with

103
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,350
take care of Yuguo

104
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,840
make sure the fake death looks real

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,770
ok i'll think of something

106
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,820
why was there a fire? give me an explanation

107
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,860
the weather is dry, a fire is normal

108
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,490
wouldn't it be good since it rids of any evidence

109
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,060
what if there was a flaw, you know the consequences

110
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,810
relax boss, I locked the door

111
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,900
and there would be no other people around

112
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,550
when I left they, were already on deaths door

113
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,350
even with that loser Yuguo, they wouldn't be able to run

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,210
I don't trust a death with no bodies

115
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,900
when you have the chance go take a look

116
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,780
Okay, I won't let them show up alive

117
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,420
Allen I only trust you right now

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,170
Relax, our whole family is in debt to you

119
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,020
I will for sure clear any obstacles

120
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,250
'Ling...Yue'

121
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,790
"Ling...Yue'

122
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,800
"Father can I help?"

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,500
little kids get in the way, go get your 2nd brother

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,330
I can feel assured when given task to LingYue

125
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,510
he can take care of it, he is my most promising child

126
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,910
I am willing to help father too not just my brothers

127
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,600
the world of business is like a battlefront

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,550
you must determine your enemy and allies and most of all prepare the right weapons

129
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,680
"boss, what to do next?"

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,390
I wanted to use Ansheng to ruin New Way

131
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,300
but Lingyue wasn't tricked and actually dragged in Gu Shi

132
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,490
but it wasn't all a loss

133
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,820
do not relax, keep a close watch

134
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,910
when the fake news of New Way selling expired goods comes out

135
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,330
the sales will definitely be affected

136
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,330
and now Lingyue cannot be the clutch savior of the company

137
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,660
Using the family name transferring the company assets

138
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,350
resulted in the company loss

139
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,670
and now without Lingyue

140
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,750
If you make a move, you can turn the tides

141
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,030
then the shareholder only recognize you

142
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,370
but I wouldn't have known it would shock my father and cause him to be hospitalized

143
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,460
and I did not know he had sent out an emergency company sign over

144
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,910
from this situation Ling Shi will be run by Mr. Lingyue

145
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,800
and ruined again by Lingyue

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,970
I can only be rough

147
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,450
Du Ming was too useless last time

148
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,890
this time I will use Anxin to lure him he will definitely come

149
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,070
remember, at all costs

150
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,080
you must make him sign

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,870
their life and death leave to Yuguo

152
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,050
here it is

153
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,030
after all these years brother Wu like to hide the key under the flower pot

154
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,990
who is brother Wu?

155
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,440
when I left school, I met some friends here in Xiao Yu village

156
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,780
brother Wu is one of them

157
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,840
the most magnanimous and the one that treated me the best

158
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,230
the this brother Wu...

159
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
is he good looking

160
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,330
oh super good looking

161
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,150
when I think about brother Wu, whom so dashing and so lively

162
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,290
I think all girls would have a crush

163
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,770
brother Wu!

164
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,950
watch your image don't be rude

165
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,160
stop playing

166
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,400
so brother Wu is a woman

167
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,190
on the outside...

168
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,660
I am a woman

169
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,170
I'm Lingyue

170
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,900
bother Wu

171
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
tell me, what do you need help with

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,390
I want to ask brother Wu to take care of a guy named Allen

173
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,230
no problem, I just need some information about him

174
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,260
thank you, you can ask me for anything

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,030
"If you have Anxin, then Lingyue will come"

176
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,260
"when you get what you need to"

177
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,910
"let them stay together for a while"

178
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,360
whats wrong Ansheng? you seem down

179
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,330
eat

180
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,100
Mom,

181
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,520
Our life right now..

182
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,090
what are you not satisfied about

183
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,360
why do you ask so out of the blue?

184
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,820
nothing, really

185
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm just really lost...

186
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Dad, I applied to return to school

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,970
you are leaving?

188
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,800
I remember, you promised me

189
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,550
to take over our business

190
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,090
yeah Lingsheng

191
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,790
you father is getting old, he can't manage without you

192
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,280
the company also needs you

193
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,370
i'm full, you guys continue

194
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,370
Bro...

195
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,190
what happened

196
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,920
Xiner

197
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,880
he didn't tell you anything?

198
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,110
no

199
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,390
don't mind him mom

200
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,810
brother is like this

201
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,780
'unfortunately the number you have dialed...'

202
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,290
<i>Sorry, you...</i>

203
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,810
why can't I contact Yuguo

204
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,910
nothing happened right?

205
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,730
no, it was cleaned up well

206
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,920
you don't need to worry

207
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,700
what...what did you do with them

208
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,120
I just made it look like a natural accident

209
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
relax

210
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,800
I don't care what you do

211
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,050
just make sure Gu Anxin is completely gone

212
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,320
what are you doing?

213
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,350
I'm asking what you are doing?

214
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,220
the thing that they gave me

215
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,590
where did I put it?

216
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,930
what thing?

217
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,490
the joint stock documents for the cooperation?

218
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,030
yes

219
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,130
I just gave it to you and you put it on your desk

220
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,540
you gave it to me?

221
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,780
why don't I remember?

222
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,540
whats wrong with you lately?

223
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,690
do you want to go check it out at the hospital?

224
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,230
no need, I know my own health

225
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,200
Presiden't Ling

226
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,760
It was my mistake that you got hurt

227
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,360
don't blame yourself

228
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,780
if they wanted us dead

229
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,520
they would always think of other ways

230
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
go back after this, make our death seem real

231
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,200
but if I leave, who will ensure your safety?

232
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,750
do as I say so they believe our death

233
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,690
these guys are ruthless

234
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,710
although they hit your noggin' that hard

235
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,390
you didn't get a concussion or a hemorrhage is pretty good

236
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,150
are you sure you were not seen?

237
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,030
when we came by car then by boat...

238
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,840
to middle of nowhere. I don't think anyone would have seen us

239
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,600
Aili has checked there was no followers

240
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,050
we can now confirm, kidnapping was by Yanghong and Lingsheng

241
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,880
if they wish us dead

242
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,100
then we will give them what they wish

243
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,300
in the mean time we will collect evidence of their crime

244
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,840
we also have handled Yuguo situation

245
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,780
so there is no one else that know we are still alive

246
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,530
even though the situation happened we still don't have physical evidence

247
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,160
we can't expose ourself this early

248
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,890
make sure you don't get caught

249
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,580
Anxin and I will live here

250
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,180
I already discussed with my elder brother, he will keep the secret

251
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,440
and spread news that we are dead

252
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,130
I'll leave the care of my father to you

253
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,180
relax

254
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,910
what do you need to say behind a closed the door?

255
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,170
we haven't been able to chat for a long time

256
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,690
I wanted to discuss something

257
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,540
what do you want to discuss? go ahead

258
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,760
Mom

259
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,320
do you remember when we first came to Gu residence

260
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,350
you told me you will find me a great father

261
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,580
and a perfect family

262
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,630
do you remember?

263
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,850
and when you divorced my bio dad

264
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,900
and took on so many jobs

265
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,560
and told me to just study

266
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,660
and don't worry

267
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,500
is it that I was too young to remember

268
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,250
but I always did

269
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,230
I know these years

270
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,190
you for me and Xiner

271
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,190
you carried so much

272
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,330
Son...

273
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,060
you and Xiner's happiness

274
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,850
is my happiness

275
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,920
mom we grew up

276
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,860
we don't need you to worry anymore

277
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,480
we can support you

278
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,060
our family priority is just to stay safe and sound

279
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,040
lets not fight for whats not meant to be

280
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,660
fight?

281
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,820
Mom

282
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,820
from young

283
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,570
I always listened to you

284
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,360
I never asked for anything or troubled you

285
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,170
please this one time listen to me

286
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,250
son, I don't understand listen to what?

287
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,960
what am I listening to?

288
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,120
Let go, Mom it's not to late just let go

289
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,790
doing this, did you think of the consequences?

290
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,950
will Xiner be happy? what about our family?

291
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,170
what are you talking about? I still don't understand.

292
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,260
and Anxin... Gu family already owes her so much

293
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,360
we owe Anxin too much

294
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,620
stop mentioning Anxin she is not Gu family

295
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,080
when i was small you taught me

296
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,240
if we did a crime

297
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,930
we will have to pay

298
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,570
what crime did I do?

299
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,260
what have I done to make you accuse your mother?

300
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,480
the assets transfer

301
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,660
I saw the Gu Shi accounting books

302
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,560
aside from you no one else has the authority

303
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,930
Son... mom is just putting the company assets

304
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,550
in a safe place

305
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,410
we are family

306
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,600
whats your father's is mine

307
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,030
is this wrong?

308
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,540
what did I do wrong?

309
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,560
stop overthinking

310
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,290
I understand

311
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,610
stop this nonsense

312
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,460
I feel like this was a long day

313
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,500
You didn't sleep at all

314
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,590
didn't we agree to watch the sunrise

315
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,380
but why does it feel like calm before a storm?

316
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,550
I'm sorry

317
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,130
I thought it would make you feel better

318
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,500
when we are alive together...

319
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,300
there is nothing better

320
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,400
we will never separate again

321
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,940
'Ling Yue'

322
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,530
Everyone, my brother Lingyue has signed all equity to me

323
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,980
this is the shares transfer document

324
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,540
I hope there are no more doubts

325
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,740
our priority is to lead Ling Shi back on track

326
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,400
I must emphasize...

327
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,800
that no one bring personal feelings to the workplace

328
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,110
hope everyone keeps this in mind

329
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,080
'why would he transfer the shares to him?'

330
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,660
'yeah, thats ridiculous'

331
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,460
attention

332
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,700

333
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,570
who are you pouting to?

334
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,390
both Ling family heirs are still here

335
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,030
what are you still dissatisfied about? speak up

336
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,970

Brother, It's not Allen's fault

359

this body guard is not reliable, fire him

361
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,200
Allen is loyal

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,310
this is a critical time

368
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,520
Ling Shi cannot have anymore negative reports

369
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,620
what do you think? President Sheng

370
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,260
I'll listen to you, brother

371
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,870
let's go

372
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,260
your nose is fine, right?

373
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,960
'Cai Niao'

374
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,590
Xiner

375
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,750
your in a good mood today

376
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,520
I resolved a difficult problem

377
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,920
so I wanted to meet you first thing

378
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,340
It must be hard

379
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,270
to run a company

380
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,070
No not hard

381
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,860
You know, Xiner, I can finally prove to you

382
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,500
I'm not any less of Lingyue

383
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,460
You don't have to compare to him

384
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,840
just be yourself

385
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,700
I out paid all his shares back to him yesterday

386
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,050
I cut off all connection to him

387
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,380
I never knew a goodbye was so simple

388
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,600
just like this little by little

389
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,210
disappear from each others lives

390
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,170
just like we've never met

391
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,780
rest assured

392
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,100
he will never come back into your life

393
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,230
actually i've been practicing self therapy

394
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,740
but I didn't want to let go

395
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,900
thank you

396
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,540
cured my obsession

397
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,470
you gave me courage

398
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,170
to restart

399
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,890
I heard when people turn 40

400
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,460
their fingerprint will become permanent

401
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,370
like these 5 years

402
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,760
my feelings to you

403
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,330
are permanent

404
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,000
if you have to say anything changed

405
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,100
Is that I like you more and more

406
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,430
without explanation

407
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,670
I remember reading about climbing when I was young

408
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,720
Mount Everest

409
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,860
as of then I decided

410
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,730
I would collecting travel expenses

411
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,320
and save it into a bank account

412
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,300
so one day

413
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,120
I could use it for my adventure

414
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,560
so where did the funds go

415
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,010
these funded my life's most challenging adventure

416
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,840
Xiner

417
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,850
I will give you a better life

418
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,340
Miss Gu Xiner, will you marry me?

419
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,640
Xiner you don't have to love like this

420
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,880
you also deserve to be loved and treasured

421
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,440
just a nod

422
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,990
I can without hesitation

423
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,910
run to you

424
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,990
as long as you are willing, I'll always be there

425
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,920
so if you'll accept

426
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,980
that I run to you

427
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,330
Yes

428
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,720
'Ling Shi company Lingyue transfered all personal assets to younger brother Lingsheng...'

429
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,370
'then suddenly disapeared...'

430
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,790
'Ling family is in a crisis'

431
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,510
'with a sudden asset transfer and a funeral in plan'

432
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,400
I hope they are alright

433
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,340
This worry...

434
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,550
also includes Anxin?

435
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,500
from young

436
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,980
she is just like a weed

437
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,440
whenever she acts strong

438
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,520
I just have inexplicable hostility

439
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,150
but...

440
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,140
she is still family

441
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,820
I don't wish her harm

442
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,680
hearing this from you i'm glad

443
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,400
glad?

444
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,480
who's brother would like to see his siblings fight each other

445
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,180
although we don't have a good sisters relationship

446
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,330
but I still wish for her to come back safely

447
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,130
let's talk about some good news

448
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,680
Lingsheng proposed

449
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,210
I said yes

450
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,520
thank you for the blessing

451
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,060
no...I mean

452
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,620
you two... already... getting married

453
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,400
but you two didn't date for long

454
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,610
isn't it a little rushed?

455
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,900
I am clear

456
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,050
I wasn't happy in the past

457
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,950
because I kept waiting for someone I couldn't be with

458
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,530
It was Lingsheng that taught me

459
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,990
a step backwards

460
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,450
can show me the full picture

461
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,840
but do you really know him? both of you...

462
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,700
thats enough, brother

463
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,100
why is it that every choice I make everyone has something to pick at

464
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,910
what have I not been able to accomplish since young...

465
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,110
how is it that in the end you don't even trust me in my own relationships

466
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,060
Xiner, thats not what I mean. a relationship is...

467
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,480
its not this straight forward

468
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,080
what grounds do you speak from

469
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,030
Xiner

470
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,060
I just wanted to protect everyone.

471
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,660
I'll always stand behind you.

472
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,400
This Allen is probably more troublesome than you guys think.

473
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,850
Because the person who rescued his whole family and raised him to do bad things is the same person.

474
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,390
In order to pay back his benefactor from his narrow escape, he won't count the cost, even his own life.

475
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,810
So, you must not take this situation lightly; take great care in everything.

476
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,530
Thank you.

477
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,770
<i> And, he doesn't have the right to talk.</i>

478
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,080
<i> This all happened too quickly. </i>

479
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,300
<i>  We're all long-standing shareholders...what are they doing? </i>

480
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,010
<i> Exactly. </i>

481
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,740
<i> How could President Ling Yue transfer his stocks to him?  </i>

482
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,600
<i> This shouldn't be. </i>

483
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,760
<i> - This company can't be tossed around like this. 
 - Right. </i>

484
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,320
<i> Will it be okay in his hands? </i>

485
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,540
Everyone, according to the Group's decision,

486
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,430
whoever owns the most stock shares

487
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,870
becomes the Group's CEO.

488
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,430
At this moment, President Sheng has30% of the stocks.

489
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,680
Without a doubt, that is in first place.

490
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,980
Based on the Board's resolution,

491
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,830
President Sheng becomes the new CEO for Ling Shi Group.

492
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,390
All of you present here are senior to me,

493
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,160
I'm young; everyone please help guide me

494
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,730
into Ling Shi' Group's new future.

495
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,580
You're looking more and more handsome these days.

496
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,380
These clothes...are rather absurd.

497
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,280
As long as Second Brohter is here, it's fine.

498
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,290
Such a big thing happening to the family,

499
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,410
even though he's adopted; I still feel like it's been hard for him.

500
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,670
Why are you bring him up? It's great that the two of us are left.

501
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,110
Don't worry, Brother, it's difficult to separate good and bad, outside from inside.

502
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,260
From now on, you'll surely have a position in the Group.

503
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:06,210
Buddy, be clear. You aren't capable enough on your own and there are lots of problems.

504
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,520
But, think about it. I'm not young.

505
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,500
If I don't succeed in this enterprise, our dad will have me sweeping the garbage out.

506
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,960
You're fine right now. Shouldn't you help me now?

507
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,030
Brother, you shouldn't say that.

508
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,090
You're always outstanding.

509
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,350
You little brat.

510
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:52,250
You don't know if I can tell right from wrong, outsider from inside?

511
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,660
You really think of yourself as a director general.

512
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,700
Why am I like that?

513
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,140
You've always been like that. Don't you know that?

514
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,130
When am I like that?

515
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,610
All the time.

516
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,820
It really is hard to imagine

517
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,760
that I can let go of New Way, let go of everything

518
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,420
and become a person of leisure like right now.

519
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,490
So, you have to enjoy today.

520
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,220
This is known as being in the perilous middle while striving for victory.

521
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,490
Tell me, will Ling Sheng really believe we're dead?

522
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,160
Even though he's the youngest, he's been held back for so long.

523
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,820
That means his shrewdness and schemes are surely even deeper than we know.

524
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,890
He'll only believe half of what Ling Fang says; the other half he'll check out.

525
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,450
So that means that

526
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,940
our days of peace will only last a few days.

527
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,000
At least this time, you're not alone.

528
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,650
True. We're together.

529
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,250
You know how to pick up the lines quite well.

530
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,800
Isn't this Fifth Brother's supermarket?

531
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,490
Yes.

532
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,930
Didn't you say that it was boring staying at home?

533
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,430
Fifth Brother and I discussed it. We're prepared a

534
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,100
private shopping spree.

535
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,730
Okay, good. Then, I'll go choose some good things to eat to take home.

536
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,390
Let's go.

537
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,630
- Are you ready? 
 - I'm ready. 
 - We're off!

538
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,690
Stop, stop, stop. We're here. Hot pot ingredients.

539
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,620
There, that package.

540
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,280
Let me look. Yes, this is it.

541
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,280
- What's wrong? 
 - It expires tomorrow.

542
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,260
There's still an hour until tomorrow. It'll take 1/2 an hour to get back home.

543
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,960
We can't eat hotpot tonight. But I really want to eat hotpot today.

544
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,550
- Let's start. 
 - Okay.
