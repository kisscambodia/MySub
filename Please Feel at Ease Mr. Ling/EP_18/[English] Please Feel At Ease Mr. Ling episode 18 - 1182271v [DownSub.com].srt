00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,210
If you want to gain the audience's favor, you must first understand them.

22
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,550
Are you okay?

23
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,960
Are you sure you can give a report like this?

24
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm perfectly fine.

25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,650
I-it's not like I'm nervous.

26
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,870
I can tell.

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,290
I believe that those born in the 90s

28
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,380
are more able to accept...

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,440
What are you doing?

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Wake up!

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,800
The toothpaste you just squeezed is my facial lotion.

32
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,430
Hello everyone. Hello everyone.

33
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,320
Why are you laughing?

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,380
No reason. I just think that your plan is pretty good.

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,880
Of course it's good! It's perfect for pairs.

36
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,040
That's enough. Mister, you can stop here.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,200
Miss, your destination hasn't arrived yet.

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,840
I can't arrive together with you.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,790
If someone sees us get off together, that would ruin everything.

40
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,190
- Just let me off here. I can walk over myself. 
 - Dummy.

41
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,790
I'll drop you off at the next intersection, okay?

42
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,900
If you want to gain the audience's favor, you must first understand them.

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,760
I set our target audience as those born in the 90s living alone,

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,520
because I believe that those born in the 90s are more able to accept this cute style.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,420
We can push this brand new style forward for our fall market

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,700
to strengthen our theme,

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,380
"Warm company, one of a kind."

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,540
What is the goal of designing a brand image?

49
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,760
It's for commercial use and brand marketing.

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
But this design is totally inconsistent with New Way's concept.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,080
You've correctly captured our user demographic.

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,010
But the style you've designed is a little too childish.

53
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm afraid it doesn't correspond to New Way's stylish impression.

54
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,240
That's true. These alternative designs lack a sense of novelty.

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,210
There's a tendency to mirror what similar businesses have done.

56
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,440
The probability of gaining audience acceptance and spreading amongst the public

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,120
is comparably weak.

58
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,060
I am truly sorry.

59
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,240
I have taken up your valuable time.

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,980
But I sincerely appreciate the suggestions you have raised.

61
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,650
We accept them all.

62
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,750
We trust that our team can use the feedback to present very good designs to you next time.

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,030
Have you finished your presentation? This is only the first evaluation.

64
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,080
Now that we have understood each other's requests,

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,790
I believe your side can provide better design proposals.

66
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,440
Meeting adjourned.

67
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,990
Wait a moment.

68
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,250
I ask that the chief designer stay behind.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,120
I have a few suggestions I'd like to discuss with you one-on-one.

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,460
Are you okay?

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,530
No.

72
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,920
There was too much information.

73
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,540
I feel a little saturated.

74
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,820
But I'll be fine after I digest it all.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,070
It's just the first evaluation. We have to look at the final results.

76
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,700
Did you not see their reactions just now?

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,750
There's no chance.

78
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,300
There's still time. In the meantime,

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,620
I can offer you some proposals to settle your direction.

80
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,400
- For example... 
 - Hey.

81
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,590
I don't want to get in by the back door.

82
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,890
Right now, I am just

83
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,610
in my small state. Once I have reached

84
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,880
my intermediate state,

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,990
I'll give you a pleasant surprise.

86
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,420
You seem very impressive.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,770
Sorry, President Ling!

88
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,340
We won't block you from teaching a lesson to the second party.

89
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,960
Let's go now.

90
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,250
Alright, don't give yourself so much pressure.

91
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,040
Just be calm.

92
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,500
Don't you worry.

93
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,630
I am without a doubt the most energetic second party there is.

94
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,520
Just wait and see.

95
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,400
Alright, I trust you.

96
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,720
What do I do? I can't draw anything.

97
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,050
Take it slow. Something will come.

98
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,320
How about you look at the references again?

99
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,440
How about you help me?

100
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,100
Me?

101
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't ask.

102
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,730
I told you not to move. Don't secretly move behind me.

103
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,240
Wouldn't it be the same if you stuck these on the drawing board?

104
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,500
I get more inspiration when they're stuck on your body.

105
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,770
Okay, just like that, don't move.

106
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
<i>[New Way]</i>

107
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,840
We have to observe and study on the ground.

108
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,130
Once we've seen the corporate culture in detail,

109
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,560
our designs will have a greater sense of reality.

110
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,940
It seems like everything will go smoothly this time.

111
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,560
- I will do my best. You can go do what you need to do. 
 - Okay, then I'll give this to you.

112
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,740
What is this?

113
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,930
A walkie-talkie. It's one of our company's specialties.

114
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,440
Who designed this?

115
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,130
President Ling, of course.

116
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,980
It does have his specialty.

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,100
- Alright, you can go do your work. 
 - Okay. If you need something, come find me.

118
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,270
Hello?

119
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,480
Walkie-talkie.

120
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,440
How come I never discovered these before?

121
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,920
How is this a company? It's like a large-scale Ling Yue fan club.

122
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,410
Are you the designer responsible for our corporate image?

123
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,250
I'm sorry, did I disturb your work—

124
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,120
Oh no, not at all.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,020
I heard that a few days ago, you were criticized pretty harshly.

126
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,630
Oh, it's nothing. Every setback makes you stronger. It's normal.

127
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,200
Please don't misunderstand our President Ling.

128
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,710
President Ling is our B2M and B2C idol.

129
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,560
Sorry, what 2M...?

130
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,980
Don't worry about that. In any case, President Ling has so much charisma.

131
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,130
President Ling always does things swiftly and decisively.

132
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,400
Plus, he's very good-looking.

133
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,060
May I ask if you've dated before?

134
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,450
No. I've always been single.

135
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,200
What are you trying to say?

136
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
Nothing, I...

137
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,300
<i>May Miss Anxin please come to the company tea room.</i>

138
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,830
- Tea room? 
 - <i>Ai Li is looking for you.</i>

139
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,070
Is anyone there?

140
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,280
How come it's you? I clearly heard a female voice... Sorry, sorry.

141
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,120
You attacked me so seriously. Are you trying to murder your husband?

142
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,390
Then why did you sneak up on me and scare me to death?

143
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,300
Sorry.

144
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,420
It's clearly your fault. You were conversing so happily with another man.

145
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,180
The President of New Way eavesdrops on other people's conversations?

146
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,370
Well if your boyfriend hit on others, wouldn't you get anxious?

147
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,120
I wasn't! I—

148
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,650
I was afraid he was in love with you.

149
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,400
Some people look cold and icy, but secretly they're fixing up with all kinds of people.

150
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,950
It makes it hard to feel at ease.

151
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,040
- Are you jealous? 
 - What? No.

152
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,360
Calm down. Don't be impulsive.

153
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,280
Our boss sometimes is like this.

154
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,410
But over time, you'll find that he is really very capable

155
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,650
and is quite a good person.

156
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,380
It must be a misunderstanding. Everything's fine.

157
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,800
- Oh. 
 - Ahem.

158
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,600
It seems like the company's security system should be upgraded.

159
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,110
I understand. This time, I really was too impulsive.

160
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,570
I think it's quite difficult for you to have such a boss.

161
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,470
You'll get used to it.

162
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,520
Go back to your work.

163
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,790
What's wrong?

164
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,910
I got burned...

165
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,410
Why were you so careless?

166
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,090
Here.

167
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,060
Does it hurt?

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Here.

169
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,100
Sit still.

170
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,450
If you were living by yourself,

171
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,530
you'd get bumps and bruises everyday.

172
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,480
If you were living alone,

173
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,180
you'd probably be worse than me.

174
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,140
That means...

175
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,790
we can't live without each other.

176
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm fine.

177
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,740
Don't be so startled.

178
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,160
I, the first party, suggest that after you apply medicine, rest immediately.

179
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,580
Such a warm and caring first party really makes me

180
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,970
want to collaborate for a long time and maintain enthusiasm.

181
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,790
Alright!

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,820
-Here.
-You don't have to carry me.

183
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,430
This is the first party carrying through with their responsibility of protecting the second party.

184
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,840
Let's go to bed!

185
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,660
<i>[Galaxy Cool Man]</i>

186
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,260
<i>[New Way]</i>

187
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,830
You're drawing these all day...

188
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,320
Can you eat him for lunch? He's not even edible.

189
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
Not only can I eat him for lunch, he's also a fairy on Earth.

190
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,590
Wake up. The person eating and living with you has got to at least be living, right?

191
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,640
The turtle still needs to only see a green bean.*(Both sides like each other)

192
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,280
The green bean in front of you is still better than an unreachable idol.

193
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,720
Good news! Good news!

194
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,640
What? The store you like has a discount?

195
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,130
Of course it's because your design draft is finished!

196
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,400
See. Only I care if you're tired or not.

197
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,460
He only cares about KPI.

198
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,300
If there's no KPI, there's no money.

199
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,980
Dang dang dang dang!

200
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,600
This is...what new species?

201
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,080
Porcupine, mouse, sloth?

202
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,930
Nope. This is I, the designer's

203
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,340
personal creation based off of New Way's founder,

204
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,210
a near-extinction animal from the prairie, the armadillo.

205
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,600
It's ugly and pretty in an interesting way.

206
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,850
Then what's it holding in it's arms? A lightstick?

207
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,850
It's their logo.

208
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,280
It's certainly not normal. Very New Way.

209
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,640
As expected of the power of love.

210
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,620
Different inspiration comes from living together everyday.

211
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,220
Why don't you talk about the sweet meaning behind it?

212
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,680
Oh, right. The more stories behind the brand,

213
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
the greater the value of the brand.

214
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,450
Understood. I'll write it right now.

215
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,070
Dad.

216
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,000
You've come. Sit down.

217
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,660
Why did you think to come today?

218
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,230
I want to come and understand the business and prepare well.

219
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,660
I remember you used to

220
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,030
hate coming to the company the most.

221
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,410
I didn't understand before.

222
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,810
Then why have you changed suddenly.

223
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,150
I want to change the current situation, in which the Gu group is suppressed by the Ling group.

224
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,990
It can't be because Ling Yue and Anxin are together, right?

225
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,520
Not totally.

226
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,430
If I can truly defeat Ling Yue,

227
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,760
then that's my declaration of entry into Gu Group.

228
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,100
To tell you the truth,

229
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,120
I don't care about your relationships,

230
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,050
but you must think clearly.

231
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,350
Your decision today

232
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,310
is an important decision that will likely decide your life for the following decades.

233
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,080
Have you really thought clearly about it?

234
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,140
I have.

235
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,260
All these years, the pain

236
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,360
and difficulties were all undertaken by you.

237
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,350
Right now, I just want to prevent all your hard work from going to waste.

238
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,210
I want to rebuild our Gu Group's greatness.

239
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,860
Tell me, is it truly ok if we make a mess of first party's

240
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,550
fancy house like this?

241
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,900
You aren't in charge of the budget,

242
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,470
so you aren't aware of us entrepreneur's difficulty in saving money.

243
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,000
We need water and electricity at our place. Isn't that so expensive?

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,980
So you've come to steal electricity here?

245
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,480
-You're going to die of stinginess. 
-No,

246
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,090
us two Zhu Geliang*(a strategist of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese history)

247
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,990
are willing to bring along a little stooge like you. Just be happy about that.

248
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,630
Zhu Geliang? You're a pig.

249
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,740
Pig head, pig brain, pig waist, pig everything!

250
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,520
If you two keep arguing like this, you'll definitely get married.

251
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,360
That's impossible. I'm too young to be blind.

252
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,500
That better be it. After all, I'm the man

253
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,750
-you're destined to never have.
-I-

254
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,160
It seems like it's really going to happen.

255
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,520
No way!

256
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,860
You're back!

257
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,530
Wait!

258
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,250
This is our company's new design logo?

259
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,950
That's right!

260
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,420
It's what you said I resembled...

261
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,910
the big turtle or something...

262
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,850
I...don't think I said you resembled a big turtle.

263
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,520
That's an armadillo.

264
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,600
-Why don't you represent New Way and try it?
-No!

265
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,070
I definitely won't wear it.

266
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,260
You're just like a huge doll right now.

267
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,720
We can put you in front of the company as

268
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,520
for good fortune.

269
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,010
Are you sure this is it?

270
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,810
How is it?

271
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,360
I can't judge it objectively,

272
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,140
because you are different to me.

273
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,540
Don't worry. It'll be fine this time.

274
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,660
Stand still. I'll take a picture and see.

275
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,230
Smile! Oh, you don't need to.

276
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,030
This design's pretty interesting.

277
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,020
It's not done yet.

278
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,740
It's already so lively incomplete?

279
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,020
-I really look forward to the final product.
-This can't be...

280
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,460
I really want them to get married right now.

281
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,390
I really admire their relationship...

282
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,200
Admire what? Just find one.

283
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,950
It's not something you can have just be wanting.

284
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,730
Just try hard. Maybe...

285
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,970
There's this one...

286
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,980
Why'd you glue them together? You're so stupid! Where's the remover?

287
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,540
W-wait, wait, wait. Don't pull on it. It hurts!

288
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,830
Gently, alright? Don't move, stupid.

289
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,600
Does it hurt?

290
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,530
Gently, alright?

291
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,050
We've used a clear combination

292
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,250
to emphasize the new idea of a 5G one-stop customer service.

293
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,200
We utilized internet resources

294
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,090
and the advantage of a collaborative network. Please look this way, everyone.

295
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,030
There are unique designs for the eyes and heart.

296
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,480
With different body monitoring devices in different environments,

297
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,890
it's a combined product using black technology and unique outer visage.

298
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,510
Use your eyes to see, and your heart to experience.

299
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,860
Slowly it will become

300
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,520
an invisible accompaniment beside people.

301
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,380
I have called named it Watch.

302
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,780
It means to gaze and protect.

303
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,100
Watching with you. To accompany and protect each and every one of you.

304
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,290
When I thought of this topic and this phrase,

305
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,020
it was actually because of one person.

306
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,020
In the beginning, I always thought I should take care of him

307
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,850
and protect him,

308
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,630
but slowly it became

309
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,830
where I was the one being protected.

310
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,620
In such a fast pace of living,

311
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,890
I can still feel warmth

312
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,140
and love.

313
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,160
Thank you, everyone.

314
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,590
Congrats.

315
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,130
This is the only proposal in which all of New Way's officials

316
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,420
have approved and passed since New Way's founding.

317
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,790
How is it? Did I make you feel surprised?

318
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,510
You've earned it through your own efforts.

319
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,770
Then right now...

320
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,930
Right now what?

321
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,930
Let me tell you-

322
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,890
I knew it.

323
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,960
She's definitely not normal.

324
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,730
So...they were just flirting earlier?

325
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,720
My girlfriend, Miss Gu Anxin,

326
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,720
in celebration of a passed design proposal, treats the entire company

327
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,810
to milk tea.

328
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,190
Are you crazy?

329
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,330
You have so many people in your company! I'll go broke!

330
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,880
Don't worry.

331
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,610
You treat, and I'll pay.

332
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,130
Idiot. Is your money not money?

333
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,160
What about the company culture and employee care that you spoke about earlier?

334
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,670
But some people don't like sweet drinks.

335
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,030
Alright.

336
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,040
Thank you for working so hard on our design.

337
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,990
There's a huge sense of achievement in designing something for the person you like.

338
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,940
Alright, I'll stop talking to you. I'm gonna go celebrate with Youyou and them.

339
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,940
I was thinking why you two left secretly, turns out you are on a secret date behind my back.

340
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,280
Who wants to go on a date with him? I'm trying to create an opportunity for you and President Ling.

341
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,180
Please, am I think kind of person who values love over frienship?

342
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,690
We have to celebrate together.

343
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,180
Indeed you're my good Xin Xin.

344
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,320
I have a piece of good news and a piece of bad news to tell everyone.

345
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,710
- Which one do you want to hear first? 
 - The bad one.

346
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,010
The bad news is we have a new assignment for the next month,

347
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,630
so we might have to work overtime again.

348
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,470
Then what is the good news?

349
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,220
The good news is

350
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,660
New Way's payment came. We can start preparing for a celebration soon!

351
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,850
How did the payment arrive so quickly this time?

352
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,220
That's because our leader is dating the President.

353
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,470
If we do well on the next assignment,

354
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,510
I will not be stingy with everyone's year-end bonus.

355
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,030
Does that mean the money I got

356
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,250
from following the advertising brand

357
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,320
Use it however you like.

358
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,010
<i>Oh no, what's with my heart fluttering again?<i></i></i>

359
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,740
<i> Indeed you can see true feelings during hardships. Has she finally discovered my good qualities? <i></i></i>

360
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,270
- Then how should we celebrate this?

361
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,860
Oh yeah.

362
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,640
Leave it up to me.

363
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,840
What the heck is Anxin planning?

364
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,700
Why are we doing a gift exchange in a dark place like this?

365
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,700
What happened? Why are so many candles?

366
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,470
Mike.

367
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,080
Why is the head a little slanted?

368
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,790
What the heck are you doing?

369
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,150
One, to save electricity.

370
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,930
Two, I did this for you.

371
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,680
What super big gift did you prepare?

372
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,560
You seem like you got your year-end bonus early.

373
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,830
I fell like you would like this.

374
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,840
Oh right, to thank you for

375
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,640
working so hard

376
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,770
I bought a pair of glasses for you.

377
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,630
They are light-adaptive. Try them on.

378
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,080
How are they? These are the newest style.

379
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,610
Very pretty.

380
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,230
Don't misunderstand, I'm just reminding you to work hard and make money.

381
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,980
We have to earn lots of money.

382
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,900
Work hard to make a lot of money.

383
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,680
Okay.

384
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,050
Why are you looking at me like this?

385
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,710
I know that I might not be your type

386
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,610
but for you, I can coexist with everything you like.

387
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,390
Wh- What do you mean?

388
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,860
You also think it's odd, right?

389
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,560
I always banter with you and roast you

390
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,460
but it's all because I like you.

391
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,060
I want you to pay attention to me; to see me.

392
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,050
I- I. . .

393
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,410
I won't disrupt the time you spend on your idols

394
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,400
but can you make some time for me

395
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,690
try dating me.

396
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,370
What do you mean by "try"? Are you confessing to me?

397
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,350
What else would I mean?

398
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,900
Who brings another man to their confession?

399
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,870
It's also my first time.

400
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,300
Then let's try.

401
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,040
President Ling, we join hands to publish the Ling-Xiao Plan early.

402
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,110
Utilize its Leverage effect. Not only could it quickly earn high profits

403
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,400
at the same time it can lead our two companies' other businesses.

404
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,170
This way, we can truly take dominate the 5G technology industry.

405
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,150
Ling-Xiao Plan is not fully prepared yet.

406
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,610
I need it to be perfect.

407
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,040
To get the advantage of being first, we have to publish it early.

408
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,750
We can deal with the other problems later.

409
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,360
And judging by economic situation right now

410
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,780
and in respect to current profits, it's more realistic.

411
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,560
Why do we do business?

412
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,530
Isn't the reason just to make more money?

413
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,480
If President Liu thinks the immediate profit is more important than future development

414
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,840
then we don't need to keep discussing this.

415
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,510
What a pity. I thought President Ling was smart.

416
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,530
Lots of businesses right now are fighting to work with me.

417
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,590
President Ling, do you really want to give up this chance?

418
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,960
Bid him farewell.

419
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,480
President Liu, please.

420
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,930
President Gu, your recent sale event received great feedback.

421
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,860
The colleagues want to have a celebration tonight

422
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,780
where do you think we should make a reservation?

423
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,530
In an hour and a half, notice everyone to attend the meeting.

424
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,770
We have to raise our market shares to at least 45%.

425
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,430
Also, tell all the departments

426
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,740
to raise their productivity. I want to hear useful content within ten minutes.

427
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,420
Okay, President Gu. I will notice them right away.

428
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,110
Wait.

429
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,040
Find a good place for your celebration dinner. Put the bill on my private account.

430
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,420
Okay, President Gu. But, President Gu, how will you get there?

431
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,460
I will not attend. You guys have fun.

432
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,220
Director Gu, Xing Ye Technology's Direction Liu is here.

433
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,710
Let him in.

434
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,040
President Gu, hello.

435
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,940
<i>[Photograph]</i>

436
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,610
<i>Finally, you are willing to pick up my phone calls?<i></i></i>

437
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,510
<i>For company matters you can talk to Ai Li. Don't call me again.<i></i></i>

438
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,940
<i>Don't send packages home again. I don't want Anxin to misunderstand.<i></i></i>

439
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,670
How do you always appear when I feel down?

440
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,440
I think this is called telepathy.

441
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,960
Somehow I felt that someone is feeling sad.

442
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,200
The dignified director of Sheng Shi Entertainment is now changed into a con artist.

443
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,040
- This is called being sincere. 
 - Okay.

444
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,540
Then I'll give you a chance to show it. Take me to work?

445
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,180
I was thinking about this. I just so happened to pass by to pick up my partner and take them to work.

446
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,450
Give me a break! You must have heard it from Lyon.

447
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,280
You have so many people keeing eyes on me

448
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,320
what is your purpose?

449
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,700
Putting in extra effort.

450
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,680
Here, Xin'er, eat it while it's hot.

451
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,570
Always getting me things for no reason, you must have a hidden motive.

452
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,930
You're right. The hidden motive is

453
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,460
I prepared a relaxation tool for you.

454
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,660
Ling Sheng, can no girl escape your soft attacks?

455
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,640
Then that's a pity. Somehow you escape it every time.

456
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,820
Xin'er, come here.

457
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,960
Come here. I'll help you.

458
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,820
No matter how brilliant someone is, there are always things they really cannot do.

459
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,070
Thank you.

460
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,500
You and Ling Yue are brothers, why are your personalities so different?

461
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,230
So are you starting to see my goodness in comparison?

462
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,630
Getting Ling Yue to do these type of things

463
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,920
is harder than reaching the sky.

464
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,640
Whether or not he does it is dependent on whether or not he likes you.

465
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,410
You're getting better at rubbing salt in my wound.

466
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,300
My neck hurts even more.

467
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,550
Xin'er, are you okay? How about going to a hospital?

468
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,240
I was joking. Did you take it seriously?

469
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,250
I take all of your words seriously.

470
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,460
Rare of you to not reject me.

471
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,450
I do not treat you that badly.

472
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,270
Not bad, just special.

473
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,590
Xin'er, I found a new restaurant. How about we try it out?

474
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,520
I want to drink alcohol.

475
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,880
If you want to drink alcohol, I'll keep you company tonight.

476
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,510
If someday you're not here either, then what would I do?

477
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,330
As long as you want, I'll always be beside you.

478
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,530
If you lie you'll become pinocchio.

479
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,640
Then fall into the belly of the whale.

480
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,530
You still remember middle school's musical jokes?

481
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,010
Aren't you the same?

482
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,000
Okay, let's get ready to leave.

483
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,120
<i>That entertainment company's Director Sheng isn't easy to deal with.</i>

484
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,340
<i>Rejected me without a single glance.</i>

485
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,740
<i>Wasn't I just casually starting conversation? Simply shameful and humiliating.</i>

486
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,130
<i>Do you know what's the reason for rejecting me?</i>

487
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,880
<i>He was waiting for the person he likes to come.</i>

488
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,290
<i>Is only playing the pure and innocent character popular now?</i>

489
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,400
<i>Really.</i>

490
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,500
You still remember.

491
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,540
I remember everything that you like.

492
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:13,050
But in the story, he didn't choose his love with Elina.

493
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,770
But the story didn't talk about how Elina had a fresh start again.

494
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,250
What memories won't fade?

495
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,100
I think the ones inside your heart.

496
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,090
This is the very special wine I collected. It's called Evermore.

497
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,350
From 2010 to this year, the flavor would be different

498
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,300
so I would collect one bottle each year

499
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,320
until the person I like marries me.

500
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,170
Why is it 2010?

501
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,990
Because that's the year we met.

502
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:18,840
Xin'er, do you know that its our first meeting anniversary?

503
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,050
I'm sorry, I can't remember it clearly.

504
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,680
It's fine, as long as I remember.

505
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:37,720
Xiao Shegn, I know you don't just want a "thank you,"

506
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,850
but I can't give you any promises right now.

507
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,510
I don't need any promises from you.

508
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:52,360
I only hope that you can go back when you were happy and that's enough.

509
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,660
Then let's forget everything today.

510
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,860
Then, cheers to your eyes.

511
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,400
In the movie Casablanca, the most romantic line.

512
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,720
Xin'er, you're awake.

513
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,080
Yesterday we...

514
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,720
We drank too much yesterday.

515
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,020
We did drink too much yesterday, but we...

516
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,720
We are adults. I don't need you to be responsible for anything.

517
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,040
Xin'er,

518
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,580
are you being serious?

519
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,060
Xin'er, look at me.

520
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,210
Your eyes clearly tell me that you're starting to slowly accept me.

521
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,010
Is this an illusion?

522
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,730
This is an accident.

523
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,490
We won't change anything because of this.

524
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,300
That person showing up in your world is an accident. I don't understand.

525
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,660
Why can't you give yourself a fresh start?

526
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,330
Could it be that you must hit the South Wall and get injured all over before you will turn around?

527
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,190
Because I'm not willing to give up.

528
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,160
<i>Because I can't forget him.</i>

529
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,340
Ling Sheng, I'm very confused right now.

530
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,680
Let me have some quietness, okay?

531
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,760
Xin'er.

532
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,100
Okay, I won't force you.

533
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,410
<i>I already know your answer.</i>

534
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,470
I respect you.

535
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,110
Remember to eat your breakfast.

536
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,080
Let's pause for awhile.

537
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,620
There's differences from what I expected

538
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,540
We still need to reinforce the base station's radius of frequency

539
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,550
and at the same time reduce the delay of the signal.

540
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,810
President Ling, we have already done the technical evaluations.

541
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,260
The program itself is perfect. If you want to enhance its capacity,

542
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,880
it still requires more funding.

543
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,730
Since you know there's room for improvement, don't be self-satisfied.

544
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,310
The funding aspect is not within your scope of consideration, you all only need to dive into technology.

545
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,320
- Do you guys understand? 
 - Understood.

546
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,000
These few days prepare the materials related to Ling Xiao's plan and initiate project funding.

547
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,740
Okay.

548
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,840
You're back.

549
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,870
Didn't I tell you to sleep first and not wait for me?

550
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,160
I didn't wait too long.

551
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,810
Why do you look so tired?

552
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,000
Are the superiors at your company

553
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,590
regretting after they found out that I was your girlfriend?

554
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,880
No.

555
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,650
They're making this decision because they like your design.

556
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,470
You've worked hard.

557
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,730
President Gu, Anxin's proposal plan is finished. Please have a look.
