1
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,350
(Chubby.)

2
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,120
(Hurry up, what are you doing?)

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,280
(I'm coming.)

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,390
(All of us)

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
(are more or less passionate)

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,000
(about dress-up and role-playing games.)

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,640
(That's because these kinds of games)

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,710
(can satisfy many of
their subconscious needs.)

9
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,560
(Maybe they don't even realize)

10
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,120
(these needs themselves.)

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,760
(Nor will they admit them.)

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,590
(Who says that games are all fake?)

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,310
(Sometimes)

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,230
(they're more honest than you are,)

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,040
(which also make you more aware of yourself.)

16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,030
(At the same time,)

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
(they will also let you understand)

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
(all these are after all)

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,470
(delusion.)

20
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,030
(Wake up!)

21
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,740
=Falling into Your Smile=

22
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,580
=Episode 13=

23
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,590
Tong Yao.

24
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,840
What are you thinking?

25
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,280
You are here to play the games,

26
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,710
not for love.

27
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,270
You said you wouldn't fall in love
with an e-sports player.

28
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,950
You've forgotten the goal
you set for yourself?

29
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,950
You can't be influenced by Jinyang's words.

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,560
No!

31
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,560
Idiot!

32
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,830
Ultra Kill.

33
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,270
KING's jungler, Guang
has completed Ultra Kill.

34
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,310
Once again, we marvel at

35
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,430
how excellent this talented e-sports boy is.

36
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,360
Although he is in the second league team,

37
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,720
it can be said that

38
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,480
his operational skill

39
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,560
is no weaker than any other junglers
in the league.

40
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,600
Tong Yao.

41
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,600
What are you doing?

42
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,190
You wrote this?

43
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,940
(KING)

44
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
You've taken notes on

45
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,240
all the habits of our opponents from KING?

46
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
Only when we have known both the enemy
and ourselves can we win the battle.

47
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,720
Let me take a look.

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,630
Good for you.

49
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,920
We should learn from you.

50
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,600
This is...

51
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,360
It's really good.

52
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,870
These things

53
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,630
should have been done by data analysts.

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,310
But since the qualifying rounds just started,

55
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,310
and we'll be against a rising team like KING,

56
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,070
we don't have to worry too much about it.

57
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,920
I thought you guys were tired yesterday,

58
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,190
so I made you relax.

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,950
The meaning of rising team is

60
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,830
one going from a lower division

61
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,040
to a higher division.

62
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,950
We can't look down on KING

63
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,360
just because it's a rising team.

64
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,240
It's not that we are looking down on them.

65
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,510
It's because there are
stronger teams or us to face.

66
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,270
There are already a lot of analysis to do

67
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,390
in terms of a transformed YQCB.

68
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,600
You also worked late last night
to organize the information, right?

69
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,600
Go for it.

70
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,510
Let's go.

71
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,430
Go for it.

72
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey!

73
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,000
If we get to level 3 first,

74
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,040
the chance of our shooter coming up
and containing the opponent

75
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,800
is 85.37%.

76
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,070
Why are you stealing my book?

77
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
What if it's a girl's diary?

78
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,120
Where did you get the decimal point?

79
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,630
Of course, I figured it out

80
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,430
after watching dozens of games.

81
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,240
You've watched dozens of games
of the rising team?

82
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,830
That's right.

83
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,270
You've got nothing to do, huh?

84
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,720
Why are you guys so proud?

85
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,000
Watch out for the failure today.

86
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,300
(Speedy Battle, Never Working Overtime)

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
You don't feel a pain anymore?

88
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,830
A little bit.

89
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,390
Then why don't you wear slippers?

90
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,510
Who has pains for four or five days
during her period?

91
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
That'd kill me.

92
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Then have some breakfast.

93
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,480
Why are you like a breakfast butler?

94
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,390
Put on your slippers before you eat.

95
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,720
I'll wait for you outside.

96
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,630
Shorty.

97
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,270
Let me see your girl's diary.

98
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,270
Why do you want to see my girl's diary?

99
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,840
KING's data analysis.

100
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,390
Didn't you say it's not a strong team
so we don't need to read it?

101
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,270
You have written it.
Why do you mind that I take a look?

102
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,150
K.

103
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,200
What's wrong?

104
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,960
Take a look.

105
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,420
(KING)

106
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,240
Gain our own jungle all the way
to reach the fourth level,

107
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,120
then invade the opponent's jungle
to gain their monsters.

108
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,550
After the first set of monsters
are done gaining,

109
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,670
we most likely will appear
in the middle lane to catch people.

110
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Catch someone if we can.

111
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,550
If can't, we can cause some damage on them.

112
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,000
The opponent's midsolo
then returns to the base.

113
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
There should be an ambush here.

114
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,510
What the hell?

115
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,000
Teach you to ambush, don't you understand?

116
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,750
I didn't get it.

117
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,510
This tactical analysis...

118
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,670
Why is she always so dramatic in the profile?

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,390
Because she's a natural born actress.

120
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,360
Drama queen.

Hello, dear audience on the site

132
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,910
and in front of the TV,

133
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,480
welcome to the 2020 National League

134
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,120
of Onmyoji Arena.

135
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,030
I'm Dudou.

136
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,750
I'm Qiu.

137
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,270
Now you can

138
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,390
follow my gesture to look back.

139
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,600
What's on the screen

140
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,510
is the introduction of KING's players.

141
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,910
The first one to appear on the screen

142
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,790
is KING's captain slash jungler, Guang.

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,240
He is the one

144
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,320
who carries KING by himself

145
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,910
from the seat match to the National League.

146
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,790
We have climbed up from the secondary league

147
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,790
with our bare hands

148
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,030
and are desperate for victory,

149
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,320
as strongly as a dying man

150
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,320
craving for the last drop of water.

151
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,120
This is the battle for survival.

152
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,960
We will give it our all.

153
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,360
So,

154
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,510
ZGDX veterans,

155
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,910
get ready to be trampled under our feet.

156
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,540
(Guang, Jungler
Young and ambitious player)

157
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,480
(Guang is really young and ambitious.)

158
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,840
- What a pupil.
(- But his youthfulness)

159
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
(is not just an empty talk.)

160
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,000
(His confidence is quite well-grounded.)

161
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,120
After all, he has just reached the age

162
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,720
legal to participate in professional leagues.

163
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
And he has led KING

164
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,030
from the seat match to the National League.

165
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,080
(And he himself)

166
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,360
(is the most powerful
driving point of the team,)

167
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,030
(the command engine.)

168
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,910
(Yes.)

169
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,670
(KING relied on Guang)

170
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,390
(to grab the snake and turn over the game)

171
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,750
(in the finals of the seat match,)

172
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,840
(allowing the team to enter)

173
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,670
(the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

174
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,630
(So I'm still looking forward to see)

175
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,910
(whether this rising team)

176
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,030
(will give ZGDX a surprise.)

177
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,200
(Selecting)
(Speaking of which, although…)

178
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,670
Wants to target me?

179
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,550
Tong Yao, I'll give you the Ootengu.

180
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,960
Okay.

181
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,120
(Okay, I think it's still a little difficult.)

182
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,480
(Onmyoji Arena)
(You can't say that.)

183
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,150
(There is an old Chinese saying.)

184
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,080
("A newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger.")

185
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,630
(Guang)
(Let's wait and see.)

186
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,150
Let's see.

187
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
Both sides are ready to go.

188
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,670
Look at the final selected lineups.

189
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,600
Okay, let's see.

190
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,000
(In terms of ZGDX,)

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,600
(the topsolo, Cat, has taken Ibaraki Douji.)

192
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,750
(The jungler K is using Youtou Hime.)

193
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,870
(The midsolo Smiling chooses Ootengu.)

194
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,200
(And the shooter Chessman)

195
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,980
(has picked Doumeki.)

196
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,700
(Ibaraki Douji, Youtou Hime
Ootengu, Doumeki, Ichimoku Ren)

197
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,550
(Chubby got Ichimoku as assist.)

198
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,720
(Then look at KING's side.)

199
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,390
(The topsolo chooses Shuten Douji.)

200
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,200
(The jungler Guang is using Mannendake.)

201
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,030
(Midsolo Jung has taken Menreiki.)

202
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,750
(Shuten Douji, Mannendake)
(SKY and YC have separately taken Hakurou)

203
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,240
(Menreiki, Hakurou, Kuro Douji)
(and Kuro Douji as shooters.)

204
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,480
Don't forget

205
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,440
to aim for catching the jungler.

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
Our tactic is to link up
the top, midsolo and jungler.

207
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,670
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

208
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,670
Come on, guys.

209
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,510
Then it's up to you guys in this game.

210
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,840
Cheng and I will stand by.

211
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,480
Okay.

212
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,080
We'll take Cheng to win today.

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,030
Tong Yao.

214
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,910
Do you want to carry the whole game?

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,360
Go, top and jungler.

216
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,390
Don't take me with you.

217
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,270
I'm just an indifferent midsolo,

218
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,440
shivering from the dominance
of the opposite jungler.

219
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,840
It's the opponent's jungler that
should be shivering.

220
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,360
(Well, ten players)

221
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,000
(have already chosen their shikigamis.)

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,320
(So what kind of audio-visual feast)

223
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,790
(will these ten shikigamis)

224
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,550
(bring us?)

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,550
Enter the game screen now.

226
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,440
Ming.

227
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,120
Do you think the tactics of
Tong Yao are reliable?

228
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,720
It's better to believe in
Smiling's girl's diary.

229
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,440
(It's weird over here.)

230
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,790
(K leaves a monster unattended.)

231
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,200
(He goes straight into the grass.)

232
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,120
(What does this mean?)

233
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,030
(Smiling is also coming to the top jungle.)

234
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,390
(Does K want to leave this monster)

235
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,120
(to Smiling?)

236
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,670
(He is already behind in the level. )

237
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,030
(If he sacrifices his gold again,
it doesn't make sense.)

238
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,960
And now

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,750
the opponent's level
is high enough to make a fight.

240
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,320
ZGDX's decision

241
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,240
is somewhat confusing.

242
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,440
(It's true.)

243
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,120
(It's really strange today.)

244
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,000
(Is the grass so attractive?)

245
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,960
(In addition to K,
Smiling also went into the grass.)

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,670
Support, help me keep an eye.

247
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,270
I'll go anti-jungle.

248
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,030
We can see that

249
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,910
Guang is coming to anti-jungle.

250
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,870
(Are K and Smiling)

251
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,550
(going to keep Guang in the jungle?)

252
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,030
Guang is coming. K, go.

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,510
All right.

254
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
(It's coming! It's coming!)

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,840
(Youtou Hime and Ootengu)

256
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,440
(surround and catch Guang.)

257
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,390
Keep him. Keep him.

258
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
(Ootengu uses the flash)

259
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,080
(First Blood Assist)
(and kill Mannendake with the first skill.)

260
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,030
Nice! First blood taken.

261
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,840
Nice!

262
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,440
Nice!

263
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,670
(This is amazing!)

264
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,750
(Midsolo and jungler cooperated.)

265
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,510
(K and Smiling teamed up.)

266
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,360
What's going on? What's going on?

267
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,080
Why didn't you tell me that
the opponent's midsolo has been missing?

268
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,870
How would I know?

269
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,120
I saw her push the lane

270
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
and retreated.
I thought she had gone back to the base.

271
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,080
How did she know

272
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,790
you were going to
invade the jungle at this time?

273
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
Shouldn't K

274
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,600
go to the bottom jungle
after going to the top jungle?

275
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,150
They must be cheating.

276
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Boasted, saying you were about to
tremble on us.

277
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,670
Cat, keep a low profile.

278
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,440
Our strength doesn't allow me that.

279
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,720
But here is the question.

280
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,150
How did they

281
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,120
know that Guang was coming to anti-jungle

282
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,080
without the opponent's vision?

283
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,030
In my opinion,

284
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,360
ZGDX must have studied the opponent.

285
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,630
(Whether it's a normal qualification match…)

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,510
Tong Yao.

287
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,630
What you wrote down in that little notebook

288
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,630
is quite effective.

289
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,000
That's for sure.

290
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,790
Good job, Tong Yao.

291
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,720
(If that's really the case,)

292
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,360
(then it's too professional
and smart, right?)

293
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,240
As an old and strong team,

294
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,120
they're able to study a new team

295
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,390
so thoroughly.

296
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,720
It's really something.

297
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,320
And if ZGDX has really mastered

298
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
KING's routine,

299
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,320
(Girl's diary of Tong Yao: 7-8 leveled Guang)
then KING team can be really dangerous

300
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,740
(There is a 65% chance of)
in today's game.

301
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,950
(ambushing someone in their own top jungle.)
(Wait for the opportunity to anti-jungle after ganking.)

302
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,150
- Come on, K
- Let's catch him till he begs for us.

303
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:38,790
(We can see that)

304
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,840
(K is already ambushing Guang in the grass.)

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
(It seems that ZGDX has completely mastered)

306
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,960
(the opponent's jungling strategy.)

307
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,670
Come on.

308
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,720
(At this moment, KING's support is coming.)

309
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,390
Kill!

310
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,960
(K's Youtou Hime lands
beautifully against the wall.)

311
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,390
(She goes away with the third skill.)

312
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,630
(Even if you support in time.)

313
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,240
Nice!

314
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,240
(But it's still too late.)

315
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,510
What are you thinking, my friend?

316
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,000
(King when midsolo is in a lane alone and
there is no significant gap between both sides' blood and gold)

317
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,300
(There is a 72% chance to fight head-on)

318
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,880
(Let's look at the core skill of Ootengu.)

319
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,680
(This skill)

320
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,270
(depends on the timing of
the opponent's skill release.)

321
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,310
(Ootengu)

322
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,310
(is unreasonably tough)

323
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,790
(in the hands of Smiling.)

324
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,030
(In this game,)

325
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,160
(as a jungler, Guang is almost completely…)

326
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,110
I'll cover, I'll cover.

327
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,270
(That's right.)

328
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,440
Wait for me to develop.)

329
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,790
(He didn't let himself be killed.)

330
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,550
(But the gold is still much less
than the other side.)

331
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,070
That's right.

332
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,070
That's nice.

333
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,510
What's wrong with the opponent's jungler?

334
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
He's been gaining the jungle
and doesn't dare to show.

335
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,480
(Girl's diary of Tong Yao)

336
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
K, Guang is in their jungle.

337
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,400
Come with me.

338
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay.

339
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,350
We can't fight, let's go.

340
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,000
K, go.

341
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,680
Copy that.

342
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,110
(This is a very good timing.)

343
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,030
(Guang has no ultimate skill.)

344
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,070
(Defeat Assist)
(And KING's overall gold is being crushed.)

345
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,880
Nice.

346
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,350
Tong Yao has completely mastered
the way Guang plays.

347
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,240
(Let's look at the bottom lane.)

348
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,550
(Chessman is already leading
the team to destroy the turret.)

349
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
Tong Yao, come over here.

350
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,510
Be right there.

351
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,270
(Can KING resist the pressure
and hold the base turret?)

352
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,510
Chubby, watch your position.

353
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,200
Copy that.

354
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,740
(Defeat Assist)

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,640
(Defeat Assist)
(After KING's team)

356
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
(missing the output of
the core fielding position…)

357
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,480
Retreat, retreat.

358
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,270
Chase.

359
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,640
Hit him, hit him.

360
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,590
(Rise to Prominence)
(And you see,)

361
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,750
(after Chessman destroying
the second turret of the bottom lane…)

362
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,070
Come on, K, I'm on, follow me.

363
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,440
Go, go. I'm behind.

364
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,790
Yes, yes. We can go.

365
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,240
We can take the fight.

366
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,640
Here we go.

367
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,590
(In another breath,
will they have the chance?)

368
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,160
(They've reached the base turret
in the top lane.)

369
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
(Smiling is also helping destroy
the base turret.)

370
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,220
(Destroyed)

371
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,750
Keep going.

372
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,200
Hold on.

373
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,780
(Unstoppable)

374
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,960
(Look at this,)

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,160
(KING can't take it anymore.)

376
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
(After the team fight,
their blood is completely exhausted.)

377
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,000
(Unremitting Assistance Assist)
(Directly killed by Chessman.)

378
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,540
(Triple Kill Assist)

379
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,590
Hit the base. Hit the base.

380
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,510
Up, up, up.

381
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,310
(While chasing after Hakurou…)

382
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,510
(Ootengu killed Hakurou.)

383
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,550
(Shut Down Assist)
(It's wonderful!)

384
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,200
(Rampage)
(This is really exciting!)

385
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,550
(Congratulations to ZGDX
for winning the first game!)

386
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,830
(Congratulations to ZGDX
for winning the second game!)

387
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,400
(By now, ZGDX has won one more game in)

388
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,240
(the first match of group A in)

389
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,270
(Onmyoji Arena National League 2020 of)

390
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,070
(ZGDX vs. KING.)

391
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,110
(ZGDX currently ranks first
in the group points ranking.)

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Bro.

393
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,350
♪We will be your heroes♪

394
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,310
Easy, easy, I didn't even sweat.

395
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
♪Come for a pilgrimage♪

396
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's go.

397
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,110
It's so easy.

398
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,240
You're great, Tong Yao.

399
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,350
(Over the two games,)

400
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,550
(there is still a certain gap in strength)

401
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,160
(between the rising team KING)

402
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,640
(Defeat)
(and ZGDX,)

403
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,440
(Defeat)
(a veteran team)

404
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
(in Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

405
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,590
(It's true.)

406
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,350
(We can see from the first game)

407
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,830
(that jungler Guang was constantly caught)

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,510
(while he was gaining the jungle
in the second game.)

409
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,750
Why? What's that?

410
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,400
Let's go.

411
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,270
Let's go, I'm not watching.

412
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,720
Let's go.

413
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,310
(And ZGDX)

414
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,640
(has got a thorough understanding of)

415
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,830
(KING's strategy.)

416
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,920
(We can say)

417
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,920
(a veteran team)

418
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,750
(can understand the way of a rising team)

419
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,960
(so thoroughly.)

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,110
It's very professional.

421
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
- It's very rare.
- That's true.

422
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
That's why it's only natural

423
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,400
(that ZGDX won this game.)

424
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,350
(That's right.)

425
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
(We would like to congratulate ZGDX again)

426
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,270
(for winning the second game
of the National League.)

427
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,590
Congratulations.

428
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,200
Congratulations.

429
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,920
Congratulations.

430
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,480
Cheng.

431
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,680
I didn't expect your team

432
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,440
would even study the information
of a team in the seat match.

433
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,400
You're really good.

434
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,720
It was a great game.

435
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,110
We have a midsolo
who emphasizes every team.

436
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,590
Don't think too much.

437
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,350
Congratulations.

438
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,310
ZGDX.

439
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,160
What are you doing?

440
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Did you just say something bad
about me with him?

441
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,270
Do you have delusions of grandeur?

442
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,240
Then with Guang just now…

443
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,750
Cheng.

444
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,590
MVP interview is about to start.

445
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,920
Please go to the interview area.

446
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,830
Okay.

447
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,480
Chubby, take this for me.

448
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,960
Yes.

449
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,510
There are always unruly people
who want to harm me.

450
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,510
Congratulations to ZGDX.

451
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,030
Congratulations to Chessman for winning

452
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,920
the first game of
the National League Finalist

453
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,790
of Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

454
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,790
So, do you have anything

455
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,200
to say to your fans?

456
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,920
Thank you for your support.

457
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,830
We will do our best in the National League.

458
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,030
It seems that Cheng

459
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,640
understands the expectations of the fans.

460
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
Then I also have an issue.

461
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,070
You were playing against

462
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,240
a rising team from the seat match

463
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,480
of Onmyoji Arena Pro League

464
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,160
in today's match.

465
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,200
ZGDX obviously prepared well

466
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,880
as a traditional strong team.

467
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,200
This is a bit surprising.

468
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,440
Why did you do this?

469
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,000
Is this your secret to winning?

470
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,070
No.

471
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,510
It's because our midsolo
is scared of every team.

472
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,510
She'd call us proud if we dare to
look down upon any team for a little bit.

473
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,440
Before we left this morning,

474
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,680
she even announced loudly at the base that

475
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,030
we were going to fail the game.

476
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,030
It seems that Cheng
and our new ZGDX midsolo

477
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,200
are getting along quite well.

478
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
Not very well.

479
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,440
But she's very good,

480
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
and has a serious attitude.

481
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,440
As a team captain,

482
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,270
I'm glad to have such a teammate.

483
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,920
With her on the team,

484
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,310
ZGDX will become

485
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,070
stronger than ever this summer.

486
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,160
Do you feel the same way?

487
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,750
You know what?

488
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,790
I saw a beauty blogger

489
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,830
wearing a new lipstick.

490
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,030
The feeling of that lipstick on her lips

491
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,790
was like a pixie dancing on her lips.

492
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,110
Why are you so slow?

493
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,110
My computer cable
and mouse cable got tangled.

494
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,350
It took me a while to get it out.

495
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,550
- Guys.
- What a talent.

496
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,750
DQ. Five that will be using the lounge later

497
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,480
is already on the way.

498
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,400
Clean up, everyone.

499
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,590
I'll be done eating soon.

500
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,110
These should also be taken away?

501
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,590
I almost forgot it.

502
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,270
The queen of morality
in the e-sports industry.

503
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,480
Thank you for your hard work.

504
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,270
This is such a moral team.

505
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
Strong and moral.

506
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,790
Perfect.

507
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,440
Hello.

508
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,880
I just said to clean it up,
nobody gave me a shit.

509
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,110
Why is everyone listening to her now?

510
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,200
Sexism?

511
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,110
You.

512
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,550
I'm going to go to the neighborhood committee
of e-sports industry

513
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,200
to denounce you.

514
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
Hurry up.

515
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,550
You will be the first one.

516
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,510
Go, just go.

517
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,510
I'm not afraid.

518
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,550
You can't get away.

519
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,720
Tong Yao.

520
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,070
When is Cheng coming back?

521
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,440
I don't know.

522
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,350
Didn't you see him since you came in so late?

523
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,440
No.

524
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,240
Let me tell you, how many people
are going to embrace him later

525
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,270
with his performance today?

526
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,310
How long will we have to wait?

527
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,440
Look at the Douban group.

528
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,310
There is such a heated discussion
on E-sports Industry Farm.

529
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Look at the situation.

530
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm afraid

531
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,960
they're all against KING.

532
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,440
Look at these headlines.

533
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,960
Rising team is just a rising team.

534
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,590
So what if they were
the king of the seat match?

535
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,480
- They were beaten all to pieces by ZGDX.
- Look at this.

536
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,680
It's really poor, I'm speechless.

537
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,440
KING's jungler makes me laugh.

538
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,200
(E-sports Industry Farm)
He's much worse.

539
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,400
They employed a single tactic
in the seat match.

540
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,440
Though they rose up
to Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

541
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
they were destined to fail.

542
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,350
How come no one complimented
my performance today?

543
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,110
They don't have time to praise you.

544
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
A group of people are now busy

545
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,400
splitting the blame for
the five members of KING.

546
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,000
Split?

547
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,270
What blame?

548
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,310
This article.

549
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,030
Some people say that the shooter picked up
a team and fought with them for ten seconds,

550
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,070
during nine seconds of
which he was wandering nowhere.

551
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,960
The support was invisible all over the field.

552
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,640
He couldn't even put down a barrier.

553
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,830
Anyway, everyone was scolded,
no one was spared.

554
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,030
Although it's said that everyone is scolded,

555
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
I think

556
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,310
their team's jungler Guang,
was the worst to be criticized.

557
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,750
Yes, he is really poor.

558
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,960
From the moment he tried to
invade our jungle to steal the monsters

559
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,750
only to be found by Tong Yao and K

560
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,440
in the opening match

561
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,680
(First Blood Assist)
and became the first blood.

562
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
Why didn't you tell me that
the opponent's midsolo was missing?

563
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,750
He was exposed to our vision

564
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,680
almost in the whole game.

565
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,000
Jungler is known for
its acting swiftly and wittingly.

566
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,110
It can help to create
early advantage for his teammates

567
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,160
by attacking unexpectedly.

568
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,680
A goon who just spent his time
in the early stage

569
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,480
and disappeared into the jungle

570
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,000
is definitely going to be cursed by

571
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,240
the audience like crazy.

572
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,110
Unluckily,

573
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,070
Guang did the same thing in the second game.

574
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,000
(He disappeared into the jungle
in the early stage of the game.)

575
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,160
(He didn't support in time)

576
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
(in the crucial team
to fight over the snake.)

577
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,500
(Unremitting Assistance)
(His four teammates were against all of us.

578
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,680
(He didn't come before they were all dead.)

579
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,240
(When he came back later,)

580
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,000
(Double Kill Assist)
(he had almost lost.)

581
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,960
(He came back and let us kill him too.)

582
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
After the first game,

583
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,790
they must have known that
something was wrong.

584
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,350
But at that moment,

585
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,720
it was hard to figure out
how to solve the problem.

586
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
So in the second game,

587
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,880
knowing that he couldn't gank anyone,

588
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,110
Guang could only bury his head
in the jungle and develop himself,

589
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,200
waiting for a chance
to join in the team fight.

590
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,960
Otherwise, what else could we do?

591
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,590
You think the crowd cares about that?

592
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,200
All they can see is

593
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,200
Guang failed to anti-jungle,

594
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,830
didn't successfully gank
and became the first blood

595
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,720
in the first game.

596
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,790
In the second game,

597
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,200
Guang buried his head in the jungle

598
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,030
with no action and no presence
in the whole game.

599
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,720
KING was like four against five.

600
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,680
These are the most superficial
and intuitive things.

601
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,590
That's why they scolded Guang most.

602
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,480
Any kind of unpleasant words have been said.

603
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,830
- Who is to blame?
- Such a poor thing.

604
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,420
(Beaten up by ZGDX,
KING's jungler made me laugh)

605
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
(Don't make it sound like ZGDX)

606
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,400
(won easily.)

607
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,830
Where are you going?

608
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,310
I'm going to the bathroom.

609
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,310
Come back quickly.

610
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,590
We'll leave when Cheng comes back.

611
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,510
Garbage.

612
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,960
The queen of morality has been laid off.

613
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,590
Yes.

614
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
She's quick to go on and off.

615
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,880
This doesn't work at all.

616
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,550
Chubby, go.

617
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,350
Why me?

618
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,350
Go ahead.

619
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,480
Or I'll denounce you.

620
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,640
Clean it up, go.

621
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,510
Go.

622
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,270
Take it.

623
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,920
Good boy.

624
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,440
Go throw it away.

625
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Wait for me to finish it.

626
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,400
I heard a noise inside.

627
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,110
So I came in to see.

628
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,640
Sorry for letting you see this.

629
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,400
Why are you hiding here alone and crying?

630
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,270
You know why.

631
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,110
Because you lost the game?

632
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,750
We got the game spot
from the second-tier team players

633
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,480
who were like a pack of wolf cubs.

634
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,000
We arrived at the gaming area with great joy.

635
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,440
I didn't expect

636
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,240
we'd lose so badly.

637
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,590
I was already very unhappy to lose the game.

638
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm even more upset to see
how harsh the comments are on

639
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,030
e-sports industry farm.

640
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,510
It's not that we haven't seen the situation

641
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,400
where winner gets bloated
while loser gets cursed.

642
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,880
I was also prepared

643
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,830
to be scolded if I lost.

644
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,590
I still can't accept it

645
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,640
when it's happening to me.

646
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,110
I want to grab everyone to tell him.

647
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
I really had no choice at that time,

648
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,200
but temporarily developed myself
and waited for the team fight.

649
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,110
I didn't gank because I really couldn't.

650
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,110
The next time will be better
if we are prepared.

651
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,070
But there is no chance.

652
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,400
So many people.

653
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,030
So many posts.

654
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,070
So many people cursing.

655
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,510
I can't respond to all of them.

656
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,030
You know what those people are like.

657
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,000
Why do you still care so much?

658
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,920
Because I used to say
I can lead the team to win,

659
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,550
I'm the best at creating opportunities
for my teammates.

660
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,590
Although I seem to be the only one

661
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,110
who is trying to chase the opportunity.

662
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,200
What they don't know is

663
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,880
every single player in our team

664
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,720
is eager for a chance like this.

665
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,310
They all worked very hard,

666
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,400
dreaming of entering

667
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,510
the Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

668
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,880
proving our strength

669
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,680
in front of the national audience.

670
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,350
I know ZGDX is good.

671
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
We shouldn't be able to beat you.

672
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,830
I thought that even if we lost,

673
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,720
we wouldn't lose so badly.

674
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,510
At least we wouldn't have no chance at all.

675
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,000
Deep down in our hearts,

676
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,720
what we have been longing for

677
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,240
is a chance to win like this.

678
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,160
I understand.

679
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,960
How can you understand?

680
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,070
You have been in such a strong team
since you played professionally,

681
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,510
and you are also very strong yourself.

682
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,400
No one will scold you.

683
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,550
The only one who wouldn't be scolded

684
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,440
may be just our captain.

685
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,000
If one day ZGDX loses a game,

686
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,000
we will definitely be scolded
by them like crazy.

687
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Do you think they will let me go?

688
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,240
In fact, the reason you have the feeling now

689
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,160
is because you were praised too much

690
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,310
when you won.

691
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,830
That's why it hurts to lose now.

692
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,070
This feeling

693
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,590
is quite familiar.

694
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,510
When I first joined the team,

695
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,030
I guess I was fearless as a newcomer.

696
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,590
When I won a training match,
I was very proud of myself.

697
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,270
Then,

698
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,550
I met South Korean TAT.

699
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,960
You know that, right?

700
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,030
I was beaten up by Tai so hard that
I was almost scared of South Korea.

701
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,000
Now when I play ranking games

702
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,400
and occasionally see that ID,

703
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,480
I still get sweaty palms.

704
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,590
I still haven't found a way to cure it.

705
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,160
But since the National League,

706
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,200
you've been acting nice.

707
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,000
I can't tell that you are nervous

708
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,880
and unaccommodated.

709
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,440
You work perfectly with your team.

710
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,400
I see that the rest of your teammates
trust you too.

711
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,680
You've got a good team, too.

712
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,550
And you're just getting started.

713
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,440
Your career is just beginning.

714
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,790
As a rising team from the seat match,

715
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,110
you still have a lot of room for improvement

716
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,160
after seeing more professional

717
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,200
teams' style of play and tactics.

718
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,680
The next time we meet on the field,

719
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,480
you will become even stronger.

720
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,350
We ended up being beaten up

721
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,640
by you easily anyway.

722
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,640
Easily?

723
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,440
The E-sports Industry Farm says it's easy,

724
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,070
then you believe it's really easy?

725
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,200
What the hell is you being led
by the opinion?

726
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
If you want to know if it is really easy,

727
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,750
why don't you ask me?

728
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,920
I have the most right to speak.

729
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,510
In order to study your jungle route

730
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,720
and team play style,

731
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,310
I watched all the videos

732
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,270
of KING in games.

733
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,830
All the conclusions

734
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,640
were only reached

735
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,680
after watching dozens of games.

736
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,510
Before today's game,

737
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,550
I was even watching
the finals of your seat match.

738
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,790
Look at the dark rims of my eyes.

739
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,550
So don't cry.

740
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,960
Why are you crying?

741
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,200
Set a clear goal.

742
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,070
And then work towards that goal.

743
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,310
Isn't that a good thing?

744
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,440
Isn't that the point of the Finalist?

745
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
No team can easily

746
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
win another team.

747
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,510
So don't belittle yourself.

748
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,790
You've earned

749
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,480
the entering quality of
Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

750
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
Just hold on to it.

751
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,240
You seem to be benign to everybody.

752
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,480
I just don't like being mindlessly praised.

753
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,240
Let the other teams be afraid of you.

754
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,640
Isn't that cool?

755
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,510
Why is that cool?

756
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,440
I stayed up late every night
to review the game

757
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,720
that my eyes were going blind

758
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,750
just to brag like this?

759
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,780
(Triple Kill Assist)

760
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,400
You watched dozens of games of rising teams?

761
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,240
That's right.

762
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,480
You've got nothing to do, huh?

763
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,000
Jian Yang.

764
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,920
You have to take notes on your ex-boyfriend
before the game?

765
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,270
Only when we have known both the enemy
and ourselves can we win the battle.

766
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,310
(So, in that case,)

767
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,400
(I lost to Tai…)

768
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,030
Why don't you say something?

769
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,640
What are you thinking about?

770
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,830
While guiding you,

771
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,070
I also figured out a truth.

772
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,480
What truth?

773
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,630
Before others seem to beat you easily,

774
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,000
who knows how much effort
has been done in private?

775
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,030
We are all human beings.

776
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,480
How can there be one person

777
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,000
as awesome as an alien?

778
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,070
So,

779
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,710
never take the enemy lightly.

780
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,550
Don't fight unprepared battles.

781
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,550
Thank you.

782
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,030
Let's go.

783
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,760
Cheng.

784
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,960
You didn't answer the phone
after being called for so long.

785
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,230
So you're hiding in here?

786
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,220
(4 Missed Calls)

787
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,230
I...

788
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,920
What are you playing?

789
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,440
Hide-and-seek?

790
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,590
This is a surprising place you picked.

791
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,480
Not bad. Very clever.

792
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,150
What do you mean?

793
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,360
Can you talk in a right manner?

794
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,320
Thank you. I'll leave now.

795
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,550
Goodbye, Cheng.

796
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,590
Hey, I found her.

797
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,360
I'll be right there.

798
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,280
You made the other team's jungler

799
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,840
cry in the exit passageway.

800
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,230
What do you mean?

801
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,590
Literal meaning.

802
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,230
Why is he looking at you with

803
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,440
that sad look?

804
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,960
He was indeed in the exit passageway.

805
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,760
I was there too.

806
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,670
He indeed cried.

807
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,510
But...

808
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,550
How to say?

809
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,760
Can you talk in a right manner?

810
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,760
What do you mean
I made the other team's jungler cry?

811
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,150
You can't just use the word "made".

812
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,150
Then why did he look at you with

813
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,150
that sad look?

814
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,070
How is that a sad look?

815
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,670
Then tell me what kind of look is that?

816
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,760
Don't you think that's a look of admiration?

817
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,190
That's the look of being tamed.

818
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,550
Where are they?

819
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
You did that kind of thing
and still want them to wait for you?

820
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,030
Do you have any kind of grudge

821
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,440
with the title of the team captain?

822
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,670
You've collected two captains
through two games.

823
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,360
You take it as stamp collecting?

824
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,800
The limited issue of stamps in 2020

825
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,710
Onmyoji Arena Pro League?

826
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,800
Shut up, you're a captain too.

827
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,230
Sorry, I'm late.

828
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,070
What did you do?

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,070
Collecting stamps.

830
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,070
Cheng just came back
and saw you weren't there.

831
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
He risked being chased by fans

832
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,550
and went back to look for you.

833
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,480
He called your phone
and you did not answer it.

834
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,590
He thought you had been kidnapped.

835
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,150
Why would anyone kidnap me?

836
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,360
Kidnap me to be their jungler?

837
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,670
- Tong Yao.
- I'm not losing anything.

838
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,280
What on earth did you do?

839
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
Who knows?

840
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,630
I went to the toilet.

841
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,630
Why did the captain say
you love collecting stamps?

842
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,590
I was just in the bathroom

843
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,630
and bumped into KING's jungler by chance

844
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,590
secretly crying in the exit passageway.

845
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,880
So I comforted him.

846
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,670
But the Internet scolded him really hard,

847
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,550
and praised us like crazy.

848
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,670
This makes me very uneasy.

849
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,630
How dare him surf the Internet
after losing the game?

850
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,630
The day we lost the spring finals,

851
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,510
Rui uninstalled all the Douban Apps
in our cell phones

852
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,400
one by one.

853
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,760
The newcomer has just started his journey.

854
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,190
And

855
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,110
KING used to be very strong
in the seat matches.

856
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,360
They used to be praised by others.

857
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,630
And what the hell you go to comfort others?

858
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,800
That's not just someone else.

859
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,000
That's our enemy.

860
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,190
What if he grows up quickly

861
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,840
after being comforted by you?

862
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,590
They can't match with us anyway

863
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,030
because we are also growing up.

864
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,590
That's right.

865
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,190
While guiding you,

866
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,400
I also figured out a truth.

867
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,800
Before others seem to beat you easily,

868
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,190
who knows how much effort
has been done in private?

869
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,000
We are all human beings.

870
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,480
How can there be one person

871
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,150
as awesome as an alien?

872
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,920
Cheng.

873
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,190
What?

874
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,320
Collecting stamps?

875
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,070
I refuse.

876
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,400
No, it's not that.

877
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,030
Say it.

878
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,110
I want to ask Tai to confront again.

879
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,440
You're not afraid of him anymore?

880
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,960
Yes.

881
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,550
When do you want to do that?

882
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,360
No way.

883
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,590
I don't agree.

884
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,670
You can't do that.

885
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,630
Why not?

886
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,670
Go.

887
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,670
I'm with you.

888
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,920
No, there are still two games next week.

889
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,920
If it's like the last time…

890
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
Devastated.

891
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,760
You shut up.

892
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Then I'll play

893
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,360
the rest of the games.

894
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,630
You'll lose.

895
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,510
Cheng.

896
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,840
I...

897
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,840
Have you made up your mind?

898
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,190
Yes.

899
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
(TAI)

900
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,000
Cheng, are you crazy?

901
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
Even if I don't help her make a date,

902
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,280
she can manage to do it herself.

903
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,980
(TAI)

904
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,190
Done.

905
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,190
Tomorrow afternoon.

906
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,030
Tomorrow? So soon?

907
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,670
It's not too late for you to prepare today.

908
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,840
Go for it.

909
