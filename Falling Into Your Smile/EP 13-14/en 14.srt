1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,400
Why are you hiding here alone and crying?

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,750
(Because you lost the game?)

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,960
(I was already very unhappy
to lose the game.)

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,240
(I'm even more upset to see
how harsh the comments are on)

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,390
(E-sports Industry Farm.)

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,640
(I want to grab everyone to tell him.)

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,670
(I really had no choice at that time.)

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,350
The next time will be better
if we are prepared.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,390
(But I don't have a chance anymore.)

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,710
You know what those people are like.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,600
Why do you still care so much?

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,430
Because I used to say
I can lead the team to win.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,240
(This feeling is quite familiar.)

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,520
(No team can easily)

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,790
(win another team.)

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,560
(Before others seem to beat you easily,)

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,840
(who knows how much effort
has been done in private?)

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,470
(We're all humans.)

19
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,840
(How could there be one person)

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,430
(who's as strong as an alien?)

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,880
(So,)

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,710
(never underestimate your opponent.)

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,350
(Don't fight unprepared battles.)

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,430
Cheng,

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
I want to ask Tai to confront again.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
You're not afraid of him anymore?

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,740
=Falling Into Your Smile=

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,500
=Episode 14=

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,710
I'll head to the restroom.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,120
Weren't you just there?

31
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,310
Scared?

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,840
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
Tong Yao, don't feel stressed.

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,560
We all know how hard you've worked.

35
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,190
I should be the one who's feeling stressed.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,190
It's okay Tong Yao, fight on!

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,840
I'll handle the pressure from the top.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,000
She's obviously panicking,

39
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,590
and you're asking her not to stress out.

40
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,310
You guys really don't know
how to put yourself in other's shoes.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,430
I'm not nervous.

42
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,150
Really.

43
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,960
My heart rate is completely normal.

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
You're not very good with stress management.

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,680
Yep,

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,400
you should learn from Lu Yue
when you get a chance.

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,710
Calm and steady like he's so experienced,

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,120
looking more like the defense turret
than the turret itself.

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,710
He knows how to rest assured,
let the teammates do the job,

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,560
just sit and wait for victory.

51
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,870
Avoid taking the lead as much as possible.

52
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,310
Come back.

53
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,750
The game is starting.

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
Where's my cursor?

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,590
My cursor is gone.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,630
Where did it go?

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
Here.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
You see it?

59
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,870
It shows up again.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
Why are your hands so cold?

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
I just washed my hands with cold water.

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,960
If you lose, you lose. What's the big deal?

63
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,750
What are you nervous about?

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,430
You were so fierce
when being asked to battle with him

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,590
looking all hyped.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,870
You're trying to comfort me?

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,750
Close your eyes.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,280
Take a deep breath.

69
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,520
Relax.

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,030
It doesn't matter if you can't beat him,

71
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,750
I'll lead you to victory.

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,520
Did you hear that?

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Cheng said,

74
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,310
"If you can't beat him,
I'll lead you to victory."

75
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,800
Sounds like something a normal man

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
would say to a beauty.

77
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,070
I have to say
I'm a little touched hearing this.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
To hear him say something like this

79
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,560
in my lifetime,

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
my life is complete.

81
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,720
You guys are two-faced.

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Why didn't you guys say he's not normal

83
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,720
when you held on to him

84
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,560
and begged him to help you win

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,680
during the monthly assessment?

86
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,870
Let's start.

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,190
Tong Yao, we're picking shikigami first
in this round.

88
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,430
Do you want to take Tamamo-no-Mae?

89
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm still going to pick Higanbana.

90
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,430
Okay.

91
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,480
Let's go.

92
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,390
The line is about to enter the turret.

93
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,390
K just ganked for you
while you still backed off.

94
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,160
So you don't even dare to
get out of the turret if Tai is here?

95
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,310
Five minutes, 0-0-0,

96
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,830
and you're lagging behind 300 gold
than the opponent.

97
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,480
Are you offline, midsolo?

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,630
You are over the top today,

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,600
stop talking.

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
The Orochi is about to refresh.

101
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,630
The gold on both sides is about the same,

102
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,510
once it gets the Orochi,
the gap should be obvious.

103
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,390
K, go give them a vision.

104
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,720
Okay.

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,240
What are they doing ambushing here

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,510
and not going for the Orochi?

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
Who are they trying to scare?

108
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,750
Wait for me.

109
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,750
Tai's coming.

110
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
What's with the flash,
did you even see him yet?

111
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,390
You run faster than western reporters.

112
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,750
I will die if I don't run.

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,560
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,510
Come here,

115
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,750
after it's done with the Orochi,
look for a chance to attack.

116
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,630
It's okay if we can't win.

117
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,270
I'll revenge for your death.

118
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,160
Chubby.

119
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,940
(Successfully Sealed)

120
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,360
Is he my support or yours?

121
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,360
If you keep backing off,

122
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,830
(Demon Parade)
will Cat have to protect you as well?

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,580
(Double Kill)

124
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,580
(Demon Parade)

125
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,340
(Double Kill)

126
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,870
(Defeat)

127
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,630
You're really playing Lu Yue style

128
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,270
with Higanbana.

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm on.

130
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,630
Why are you hiding?

131
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,240
The jungler already got on
and you're still hiding.

132
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,380
(Legendary)

133
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,730
(Destroyed)

134
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Come back.

135
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,240
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

136
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Chubby is dead.

137
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,310
Not in a good state, let's retreat first.

138
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,600
Cat's coming to support, don't panic.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,630
Hide in the back and continue the attack.

140
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Go go go.

141
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
If we win the team fight,
we can push it all the way.

142
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,560
No need to hide when you see Tamamo-no-Mae.

143
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,480
-Hold on, Cat.
-Cat, hold a bit longer.

144
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,620
(Defeat)

145
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,270
Tong Yao, come on and take it.

146
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,220
(Perfect Power)

147
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
No, no, I'm being controlled.

148
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,940
(Triple Kill)

149
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,660
(Ubume, Yuki Onna)

150
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,310
This can be done.

151
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
Tai has to go back and clean the line.

152
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,860
(Double Kill)

153
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,580
(Shuten Douji
Tamamo-no-Mae)

154
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,780
(Higanbana)

155
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,060
(Defeat)

156
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll head back to the base
and wait for your resurrections.

157
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,040
Push it through.

158
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,600
One-on-one. Have a good show.

159
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
(Legendary)

160
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,240
Don't panic.

161
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,550
Even if you lose, it's okay.

162
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,320
Yeah, Tong Yao,

163
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,870
we can try again in the next battle.

164
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,000
(Before others seem to)

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,870
(beat you easily,)

166
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
(who knows how much effort
has been done in private?)

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,270
(We're all humans.)

168
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,840
(How could there be one person)

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
(who's as strong as an alien?)

170
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,750
(Never underestimate your opponent.)

171
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,960
Nice, Tong Yao!

172
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,340
(Victory)

173
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,240
Well played.

174
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,080
Seems easier than imagined,

175
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,840
right?

176
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,200
That's right.

177
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,510
Not as invincible as the legend has it.

178
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,360
That's right.

179
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,200
It was never about you anyway.

180
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,750
Nice job.

181
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,910
Your recent training paid off.

182
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,630
I should thank everyone.

183
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,000
I won because of you guys.

184
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
You are too humble.

185
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,270
This is not reliance,

186
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,510
we're a team.

187
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,750
Hey, you.

188
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,840
You guys were never this kind to me!

189
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,240
You're so thick-skinned,

190
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,630
why do we need to be kind to you?

191
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll have to work harder in the future,

192
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
and strive to kill him by solo
as soon as possible.

193
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,000
You are so proud.

194
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,080
But it's acceptable.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
Today's training game

196
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,840
marks a milestone victory for Tong Yao.

197
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,720
So I propose

198
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,510
we should go have something nice today!

199
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:46,960
Great!

200
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
Good! Excellent idea!

201
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,270
- The club will pay for it. Let's go!
- Yes!

202
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,720
Who says the club will pay?

203
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,910
Works well!

204
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Rui is paying.

205
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,720
If it is inevitable
for every professional player

206
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,790
to go through a darkest moment,

207
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,320
then,

208
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,790
from the moment I defeated Tai,

209
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,390
this experience

210
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,120
has become a part of my armor.

211
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,670
I'll always remember

212
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,960
the belief of a professional player.

213
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,480
This will never fade.

214
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,120
How about building a new belief

215
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,910
with the determination to win?

216
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
Come on.

217
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,840
Chubby, how about this pair of shoes?

218
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,870
So ugly.

219
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,720
Show me.

220
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,780
("Onmyoji: The Card Game"
Official release of full version CG)

221
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,700
(ZGDX post-game interview)

222
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,200
But she is strong

223
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
and has a very serious attitude.

224
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,870
As the captain, I'm delighted

225
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,080
to have such a teammate.

226
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,670
ZGDX will become more powerful than ever

227
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
with her joining our team

228
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,630
this summer.

229
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,440
(The Cowherd and The Girl Weaver?)

230
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,670
(That's the Cowherd and The Girl Weaver.)

231
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,120
(Cheng's smile is obvious.)

232
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,960
(He said they don't know each other well.)

233
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,720
(Cheng, give me some compliments as well!)

234
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,680
(That's the Cheng I love.)

235
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,720
Poof, boring.

236
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,030
(I will always support you!)

237
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,920
(Cheng is such a wonderful man.)

238
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,830
ZGDX will become more powerful than ever.

239
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,440
He's really smiling.

240
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,030
Rui, Rui.

241
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,750
What?

242
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,030
You need to go to the toilet?

243
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,960
Can't hold it anymore?

244
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,510
- Excuse me.
-No, no.

245
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,240
Look at this, Rui.

246
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,880
What? Are people bashing you online again?

247
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,830
(But she is strong)

248
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,510
(and has a very serious attitude.)

249
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,350
(As the captain,
I am delighted to have such a teammate)

250
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,270
(joining in.)

251
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,790
Give it back to me.

252
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,510
Isn't this an old interview?

253
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,750
This was happened from long ago.
You guys are too noisy.

254
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,880
Rui and I were just watching a video.

255
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
You were complimenting me.

256
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,510
What's wrong with that?

257
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
The staff wrote the interview outline,

258
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,310
I just read the script.

259
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,400
Ask Rui if you don't believe me.

260
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,200
Is that true, Rui?

261
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
No.

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,350
The piece of paper
had only the interview questions on it.

263
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,550
Who'd dare to teach Lu Sicheng

264
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,960
how to answer the reporters' questions?

265
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,920
Give me my phone.

266
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,790
No.

267
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,350
Give it to me.

268
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,830
Nope. No.

269
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,680
Give it to me.

270
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,310
Nope.

271
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,030
What are you doing?

272
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,790
Cheating for you.

273
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,310
What?

274
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,000
What's going on?

275
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, what's going on?

276
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Delete it.

277
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,000
Got to have long hands

278
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,030
to play the hero
who saves a damsel in distress.

279
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,640
Caring for small animals is a virtue.

280
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,240
Who's the small animal?

281
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,830
Lu Yue,

282
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,880
who are you sending the photo to?

283
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,790
Is it posted online?

284
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,830
How can it be?

285
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm not that low.

286
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,640
You are lower than you think.

287
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,270
(Ms. Wang)
This is the same girl

288
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,310
who got complimented by Cheng
in the interview.

289
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,480
This should be turned over.

290
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,960
God, is my food ready yet?

291
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm so hungry.

292
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,510
Me, too!

293
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,830
Stop rushing!

294
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,030
All you know is eating every day.

295
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,790
I'll bring it over.

296
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,030
Okay, go.

297
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,830
I said I'd do it. You're so slow.

298
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,750
Thank you.

299
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,830
Is it good?

300
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,740
(Mrs. Lu)

301
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,020
(Mrs. Lu)

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,270
Told you not to mess around.

303
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,550
Our sister-in-law is calling.

304
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
What sister-in-law?

305
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,270
Oh, this.

306
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,510
You pick it up.

307
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,960
You just want to see
a war break out, horrible kid.

308
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,110
Give me some, too.

309
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,680
Cheng, the phone was ringing
for a long time.

310
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,160
Who was it?

311
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,270
Looks like your girlfriend.

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,920
Mrs. Lu.

313
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,350
I saw it by accident.

314
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,160
Shut up.

315
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
Not that, Mrs. Lu.

316
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,550
Hello.

317
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,270
What are you doing?

318
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,960
I called you so many times
and you didn't pick up.

319
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,880
What important thing that kept you so busy?

320
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,480
Speak slowly. What's the hurry?

321
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,590
You're not even speaking clearly.

322
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,480
Also, aren't you in a meeting?

323
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,510
Why did you sneak out?

324
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,440
If you keep messing around like this,
your company's going to go bankrupt.

325
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,680
Intimate tone.

326
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,200
Sounds like a complaint but not really.

327
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,750
Sounds like he's indulging her.

328
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,680
So it is his girlfriend.

329
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,310
She is my teammate, why did I compliment her?

330
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,030
She played well in the game,
so I complimented her, what's the matter?

331
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm going to the bathroom.
You guys can eat first.

332
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,160
Cheng.

333
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,480
What?

334
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,680
Although I don't know

335
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,640
who's going to be lucky enough
to become your Mrs. Lu,

336
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,680
but I'm already

337
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,070
feeling envious of her.

338
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
Because she will be well protected by you,

339
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,680
invulnerable and undefeatable.

340
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,160
Cheng,

341
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,680
do you have a girlfriend already?

342
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,110
What's wrong with you?

343
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,750
Looking all upset, are you jealous?

344
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Don't be crazy, girl.
He is out of your league.

345
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,070
All right.

346
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,480
It'll definitely look good.

347
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,830
What?

348
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,750
You're coming to Shenzhen?

349
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,680
What are you going to do in Shenzhen?

350
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,070
My national league has started.

351
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,590
I don't have time to mess around with you.

352
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
Mess around? Didn't Lu Yue tell you?

353
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,480
When did Lu Yue tell me?

354
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,200
If you want to see him
and wants him to go back,

355
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,680
call him yourself.

356
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,070
Don't always try to scare me

357
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,350
by telling me
you're going to run away from home.

358
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,590
Is everything alright?

359
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,720
My mom.

360
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,200
Okay, I got it.

361
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,640
Let me do it. What do you guys want?

362
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,070
Do you know how?

363
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,240
Of course.

364
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,480
Okay then, let her do it. Let's go.

365
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,200
All yours.

366
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,960
It's good.

367
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,030
Looking so upbeat, did you win the lottery?

368
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,310
- Go go go.
- Let's go.

369
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,440
You want some?

370
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,440
- Is it done?
- Want some?

371
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,400
Here.

372
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,590
Thank you.

373
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,480
Why aren't you eating?

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,110
I'll get fat if I eat too much.

375
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,590
It's so good.

376
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,180
(Mrs. Lu)

377
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,160
Lu Yue,

378
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,510
you seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest.

379
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
If this affects Cheng's performance,

380
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,750
you're going to pay with your salary.

381
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,550
You will never understand

382
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,480
the feeling of a mother

383
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,440
who has a handsome son
that's of marriage age,

384
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,400
but doesn't even have a girlfriend.

385
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
But if she suddenly

386
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
sees hope one day,

387
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,640
then that hope ceases quickly,

388
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
that'll be a big problem.

389
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
(Ms. Wang)

390
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,400
Hello.

391
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,310
Cheng, it's for you.

392
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,000
Blind date?

393
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
What blind date?

394
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,270
Don't you think
you are a little crazy to say this?

395
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,350
I will have a game next week.

396
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,640
I have training games every day.

397
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
How do I have time for a blind date?

398
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,110
I don't care if she's good looking.

399
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,000
A fair lady?

400
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,200
How do you define a fair lady?

401
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,640
Someone who's not going to disturb me
when I play training games,

402
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
and when I'm in competitions,

403
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,790
who won't say stupid things on the Internet,

404
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
who won't ask to see me on every holiday,

405
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
and who's so quiet that
she doesn't seem to exist?

406
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,790
If that's what the fair lady is like,

407
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,270
I'm okay with that.

408
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,750
Cheng.

409
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,640
Fair lady,

410
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,200
I like that.

411
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,350
You haven't gotten your games straighten out,

412
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
stop that fantasy.

413
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,070
So what?

414
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,480
That's not very nice.

415
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,790
Even electronic pets will vibrate
when they are hungry.

416
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,200
Yeah, I'm a male chauvinist.

417
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,240
Isn't that good?

418
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,070
You won't have to worry about
my sexuality anymore.

419
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
A male chauvinist who doesn't like women
is even more terrifying.

420
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,270
Why do you…

421
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,550
Why don't you just admit that

422
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,240
you've got something going on
with the shorty?

423
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,310
It's not like she'd know.

424
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,310
It's okay.

425
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,750
I'll take care of

426
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,790
Ms. Wang.

427
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,240
Hello, mom.

428
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,790
It's me.

429
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,440
Mom, don't mess around.

430
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,590
For someone so high-class like my brother,

431
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,830
a bunch of girls

432
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,830
will fall for him in an instant.

433
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,880
You won't need to arrange
a blind date for him.

434
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,400
This is a very important year for our team,

435
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,030
we're really busy.

436
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
This is the year that determines

437
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,720
whether we'll get the championship.

438
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,960
You're right.

439
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,920
It's time for my brother
to go on a blind date.

440
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,830
I'll help you persuade him.

441
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,310
Mom says if I dare to say another word,

442
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,590
she'll arrange a blind date

443
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,960
for me too.

444
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm only 23 years old,

445
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,110
so I won't sacrifice my youth

446
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,400
for our grand brotherly love.

447
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,070
Happy blind date.

448
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,790
I heard she's a pretty girl.

449
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,550
She's the same age as you,
and her name is Su Luo.

450
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,790
She just came back
from her studies in Britain.

451
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,640
Her family

452
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
is also in a business relationship
with our family.

453
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,830
I'm sure it'll be

454
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,680
a match made in heaven.

455
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,680
Cheng, don't look at me like this.

456
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,110
It's not my first time

457
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,590
having betrayed you, right?

458
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,920
Cheng, don't be mad.

459
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,750
Hi, mom.

460
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,880
Here.

461
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,030
Just eat this, and he'll cool down.

462
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,110
So,

463
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,200
is your brother really going on a blind date?

464
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,590
Probably just a formality.

465
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,310
If that's something Ms. Wang has decided on,

466
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,110
then no one can persuade her.

467
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,480
But if the girl

468
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,920
is truly a sensible and pretty fair lady,

469
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,640
isn't it at least better for him
to go on a date

470
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,240
than acting like a robot all day?

471
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,200
Maybe

472
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,720
he'll become a kinder person.

473
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,680
You hung the phone faster than anyone

474
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,160
when you were asked to go on a blind date.

475
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,550
I am different.

476
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,640
I have Onmyoji Arena.

477
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,480
Oitsukigami is my girlfriend.

478
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,750
Girlfriend?

479
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,440
Can't even play Oitsukigami's skills well.

480
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,200
Jerk.

481
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,270
Take some notes with that free time

482
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,880
instead of bickering.

483
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,510
The next game is not easy.

484
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,640
LAN is one of the old
and traditional noble teams.

485
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,110
Even though they haven't been
very good in recent years,

486
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,400
they haven't yet fallen into
the relegation match,

487
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,640
and they're still hovering in the mid
to upper reaches of the league.

488
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
FNC is trickier.

489
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,310
Theoretically,

490
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,310
it's the only team

491
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,070
that can challenge us in this set.

492
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,030
We can't underestimate them.

493
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,400
You guys should be clear on that.

494
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,680
I remember.

495
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,830
Cat was quite miserable

496
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,310
ganked by them in the last training match.

497
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,480
We had to rely on Tong Yao of
middle lane to get back on track,

498
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,510
drag it to middle and late stages
with a strong duo ADC,

499
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,790
and had Cheng take over the game

500
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,640
to win.

501
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,960
So we have to be prepared.

502
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,200
Hear that?

503
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,750
Do your homework.

504
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,350
Mom,

505
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,440
can you stop introducing girls to me

506
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,200
without my consent?

507
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,200
I really don't have time now.

508
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,200
I don't have to

509
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,640
introduce FNC any more, right?

510
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,000
We've all had a few games with them.

511
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,440
I believe we have a sense of
what they're capable of.

512
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,070
- Nice.
- Come on.

513
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,160
If they are assigned to the red side,

514
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,110
Kun will definitely go for Dharma
on the bottom lane.

515
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,350
If Dharma

516
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,000
sees the jungler's movement
on the other side,

517
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,680
he'll find a chance to ambush

518
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,160
or invade the jungle.

519
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,070
He'll have a high success rate.

520
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,750
Look,

521
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,550
(Parasite)
Here.

522
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,290
(Xiaolingkun)
Here

523
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,000
(Red Imp)
and here.

524
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,480
We've all been ambushed by them.

525
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,240
On the contrary,

526
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,960
if we don't allow him
to take Dharma in the beginning,

527
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,440
and we occupy the vision of
the river course on the other side,

528
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,200
then he will lose his tempo.

529
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,920
See?

530
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,160
In the match against CK,

531
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,590
the jungle almost got destroyed by Yang

532
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,510
because he lost our tempo in the beginning.

533
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,200
That's right.

534
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,030
Ming,

535
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
those mixed nuts are working on you.

536
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,350
Big moves come continuously.

537
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,440
Come on, have one more.

538
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,920
Why do I feel like the team took in

539
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,510
another data analyst all of a sudden?

540
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,680
I like that.

541
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,510
Not like we have to
pay another person's salary.

542
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,000
If you guys can learn from Tong Yao,

543
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,030
I'd thank the Lord.

544
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,350
Laziness is something
that can be cultivated slowly.

545
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,790
No rush.

546
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,270
Nonsense.

547
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,480
It's good, satisfying.

548
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,030
Look,

549
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,400
when Lu Yue first came,

550
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,510
he was also hardworking.

551
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,310
But see,

552
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,350
now he's just another dummy who

553
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,880
plays with someone else's account
and lose points.

554
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,640
Damn you Chubby, shut up.

555
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,030
Okay.

556
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,880
Got it.

557
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,680
See you there.

558
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,960
Lu Yue, where's my car key?

559
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,440
I don't know.

560
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,590
Tong Yao,

561
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,030
pay attention to this, too.

562
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,880
Are you going out?

563
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,880
Yeah.

564
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,400
My mom asked that girl out

565
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,830
and only told me
after the girl left the house.

566
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,590
Which girl?

567
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,960
Blind date?

568
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,750
What blind date?

569
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,750
You are running about bare footed again.

570
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,000
Next time you have your period,

571
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,790
no one will have sympathy for you
even if you have to crawl due to the cramp.

572
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,310
Put them on.

573
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,070
Tong Yao.

574
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,920
Come take a look at this habit of Kun's.

575
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,880
Coming.

576
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,110
Also, pay more attention to this.

577
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,550
Miss Su.

578
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,270
Hello, I'm Su Luo.

579
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,480
Lu Sicheng.

580
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,200
Someone entrusted me to take you home.

581
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,840
You're not going to have a cup of coffee?

582
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,400
No, I've got something else to do later.

583
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,510
Okay.

584
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,800
Give me a few minutes.

585
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I need to use the restroom.

586
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,030
Please.

587
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,260
(Mother)

588
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,190
Hello dear.

589
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,030
How is it today?

590
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,360
Is the blind date going well?

591
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,230
Mom,

592
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,070
those matchmakers you found

593
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,880
didn't take their jobs seriously.

594
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,150
You don't like him?

595
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,440
We've all seen his photos before.

596
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,190
No.

597
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,590
He looks better

598
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,030
in person.

599
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
But I didn't have any hopes,

600
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,710
so I wasn't prepared.

601
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,840
My daughter is beautiful
just the way you are.

602
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,440
What else do you need to prepare?

603
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,670
Anyway, I'm very satisfied

604
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,030
with this one.

605
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,320
Okay, he's waiting for me outside.

606
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,400
I'll talk to you later.

607
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,280
Let's talk about it at home. Bye.

608
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,400
Okay.

609
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,980
(Lu Sicheng)

610
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,000
(Rabbit Tightly Holds the Carrot)
On the blind date?

611
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,230
(Sent to Rabbit Tightly Holds the Carrot)
Just met.

612
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,110
Is she pretty?

613
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,070
I didn't look closely.

614
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,110
Where are you?

615
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,510
The coffee shop
on the first floor of Star Building.

616
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,190
You went so far for the blind date.

617
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,800
But I know that place.

618
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,320
Go out and walk 300 meters to the right,

619
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,190
there is the best shop of Takoyaki.

620
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,280
Add some seaweed and bonito flakes,

621
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,440
you'll capture
the heart of any girl in an instant.

622
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,030
What else do you know besides eating?

623
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,230
You're not being appreciative.

624
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

625
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,920
Fifteen minutes, you have bad digestion?

626
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,360
You guys don't know a thing.

627
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,760
I went to freshen up,

628
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,110
not to the toilet.

629
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,360
Excuse me.

630
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,000
Hello there.

631
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,670
Check, please.

632
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,710
Here you go, please.

633
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,230
Okay.

634
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,360
Let's go.

635
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,510
I heard you are
a professional e-sports player.

636
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,230
Yes.

637
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,760
Quite different from what I expected.

638
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,320
I thought that e-sports players
are internet addicts.

639
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,670
I've never thought someone like you
will be a part of them.

640
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,550
What about me?

641
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,800
I have a pretty good feeling about you now.

642
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,670
What do you think?

643
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,320
I have a good feeling about e-sports as well.

644
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,710
Is this your first blind date?

645
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,320
Is it not for you?

646
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,960
Where are we going now?

647
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,400
Do you want to have that?

648
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,620
(Takoyaki)

649
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,840
I'm not used to eating those kinds of stuff.

650
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,110
Looks very greasy

651
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,230
and... not very hygienic...

652
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,710
Hello, a large one, please.

653
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,880
More bonito flakes and more seaweed, to-go.

654
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,840
OK, one minute.

655
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,510
So cute.

656
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
So handsome.

657
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,440
You're a fan of this?

658
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,510
Buying it for my pet.

659
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,710
You have a pet?

660
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Is it a dog?

661
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,230
Pretty nice food for it, then.

662
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,480
A rabbit.

663
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,590
Rabbit?

664
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,630
Can rabbits eat such greasy things?

665
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,510
She's a trash can
and she can take in everything.

666
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,360
Thank you.

667
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,070
How can you say this about your rabbit?

668
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,800
It is raining all of a sudden.

669
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,800
The weather forecast didn't even tell us.

670
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,280
Wait for me here.

671
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,190
I'm going to take my car.

672
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,230
So jealous.

673
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,880
So hot.

674
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,030
I want a car like this
on a rainy day as well.

675
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
Not the same for me.

676
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,230
I want the man in that car.

677
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,480
In your dreams.

678
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,550
Look at his girlfriend and look at you.

679
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,760
So unfortunate.

680
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,630
Didn't even get to sit down

681
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,710
and have a good chat with you
due to the heavy rain.

682
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,440
Are you free this weekend? We can…

683
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,800
I have a game to play this weekend.

684
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,400
I'll go and watch your game then,

685
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,920
I've never seen

686
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,070
an e-sports game before either.

687
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,510
As your friend,

688
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,190
can I go to the backstage?

689
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,800
Miss Su,

690
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,480
you're pretty good.

691
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,230
You are, too.

692
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,230
But I don't think

693
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,400
we're right for each other.

694
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,880
Look, the rain came so suddenly.

695
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,000
It's God's arrangement.

696
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,030
How about this?

697
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,320
Tell me where you live,

698
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,230
and I'll give you a ride back.

699
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,150
Okay.

700
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,880
Tong Yao.

701
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,670
You've seen this video
three times already, right?

702
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,550
I'm just looking at the details.

703
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,480
I wonder if Cheng brought

704
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,280
an umbrella with him
since it's raining heavily.

705
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,710
My brother's still out.

706
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,190
It must be a pretty smooth blind date.

707
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,840
We will have a sister-in-law soon.

708
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,000
What are you going to do?

709
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,360
Want to go for a double-queue?

710
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,440
I'm tired and going to lie down.

711
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,960
What's wrong with her?

712
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,590
