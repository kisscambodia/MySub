1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,430
You see?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,320
I think it's right here.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,280
(In the base of e-sports…)

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,630
Well, let's go.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,750
(Anything unimaginable could happen.)

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,560
Can I get any rewards from you, captain?

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,350
A little red flower from the captain.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,750
Silly pig Lu Sicheng,
the ugly flowers won't come off.

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,870
You don't like the little red flower?

10
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,160
I can draw you a tortoise next time.

11
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,070
So they went to do

12
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,670
this kind of stealthy things.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,070
Do you have the guts to say that again?

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,160
Let's go to dinner together.

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,160
My treat!

16
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,670
Okay, it's your treat.

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,070
(However,)

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,840
(peace and love)

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,470
(do not belong here.)

20
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,600
Dad.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,840
Mom.

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,920
Who's that Chessman?

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,960
Who on earth is that Chessman

24
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,840
you always talk about?

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,520
Does he have a crush on you?

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,880
By the way, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

27
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,070
I forgot to tell you something just now.

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,150
I also have a name called Chessman.

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,710
Good, good.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,960
I slept very well last night.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,560
That's right.

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,630
You should go to bed earlier from now on.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,120
All right.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,630
That's our gaming area.

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
It's a nice environment.

39
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,190
Interesting. The restaurant is here.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,710
Come on.

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,280
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,750
- Good morning.
- We have prepared a good breakfast.

43
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,800
I don't know which flavor you prefer.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,470
So I bought a little bit of every kind.

45
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,030
We have congee, doughnuts, soy milk,

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
coffee and Panini.

47
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,280
You can choose whatever you like.

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,870
That's too much.

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,910
Let's all eat together.

50
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,400
We've already ate earlier.

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,360
Enjoy your meal, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
Okay. Thank you.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,590
Hi.

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,560
My name is Han Meimei.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,430
Good morning.

57
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Good morning.

58
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,400
How do you do?

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,870
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Good morning.

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,870
We have to review the game from yesterday.

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,910
You set the time.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,430
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,430
Good morning.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, let's find some time this afternoon

66
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,150
and review the game with them.

67
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,800
Okay.

68
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,430
Mom, Dad.

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,800
Wait for a while.

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
I've called you a special taxi on Didi.

71
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,710
It should be here soon.

72
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,590
What special taxi?

73
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,310
We can just hail a car
on the side of the road.

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,150
It'll be fine.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,750
That's right.

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,520
You just got here.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,800
It must have cost you a fortune.

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,910
Save your money.

79
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
It's okay, Mom.

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,840
You can hardly hail a taxi here.

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,150
It's convenient to use Didi.

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,520
It just takes a few moves of the fingers.

83
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,800
Yao.

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,190
I'm telling you.

85
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,560
This is a quite a remote place.

86
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,280
I didn't see anyone

87
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,520
when I came here last night.

88
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,680
If you go out at night,

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,080
you must find someone to go with you.

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,070
Don't go out alone.

91
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,920
Mom.

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,430
I'm not a kid anymore.

93
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,920
I can take care of myself.

94
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,720
Besides, we're all teammates.

95
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,720
We're all about the same age.

96
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not sure who will accompany whom.

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
If you really need to go out,

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
you can ask Chessman
to accompany you.

99
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,120
Cheng?

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
Forget it.

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,070
His name is

102
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,360
Lu Sicheng?

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,040
What does his family do?

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,950
I think they run a business.

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,190
He seems

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,750
to have been born in a well-off family.

107
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
He's polite too.

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,630
Did he  study abroad?

109
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,800
- Is this the one?
- Yes.

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,800
That's it.

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,000
Hello.

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Driver of Special car on Didi,
Lee at your service.

113
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,600
Are you the passenger whose
tail phone number is 0305?

114
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,070
Yes, to the high-speed railway station.

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,270
All right, let me take it for you.

116
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,000
No, I'll do it myself.

117
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll do it.

118
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,870
Okay, you can take a break.

119
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,750
Thank you.

120
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,720
Where did he go to study?

121
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,950
I don't know.

122
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,310
Mom.

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Why do you ask?

124
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,190
Do you want me
to bring his household register too

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,800
to show you?

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,390
You even have his household register?

127
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,830
Let's get in the car.

128
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,240
All right, time to go.

129
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,560
Come on, please get in.

130
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,040
Come on, be careful.

131
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,830
Please fasten your seat belts.

132
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,510
Mom, Dad, have a safe trip.

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
Text me when you get home.

134
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay, I got it.

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,510
Don't worry.

136
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,430
Yao.

137
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,560
Good for you.

138
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,360
Go for it.

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Eat on time.

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
- Bye-bye
- Bye-bye.

141
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,120
Bye-bye.

142
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,040
Let's go. It's time for our regular meeting.

143
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,240
Today we're going to talk about
the four-preserving-one system.

144
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,120
According to the traditional definition
of the four-preserving-one lineup…

145
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,600
Excuse me.

146
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait for me. I've got a delivery.

147
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,070
Okay.

148
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,040
Let's wait for him.

149
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,430
Ming.

150
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,830
Take a look at this.

151
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Is there a problem here?

152
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Tong Yao.

153
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,510
These are all from your fans.

154
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
Your fans are so nice to you.

155
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,160
These are all your favorites.

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,510
This gift box looks so fancy.

157
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
The packaging is exquisite.

158
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,560
Tong Yao.

159
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,240
Your fans have good taste.

160
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,160
What's this?

161
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,950
Tong Yao, you even have male fans.

162
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,270
Dear Yao.

163
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,630
I wonder how you're doing these days.

164
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,310
- How are you doing?
- Give it to me.

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,270
Are you happy? You…

166
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
In twenty-four hours a day,

167
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,310
- do you even think of me…
- Cat.

168
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,040
for one minute?

169
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,310
Who is "The Place Where the Sun Blooms"

170
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,000
here?

171
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,630
Sunflower, Jian Yang.

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
From now on, all deliveries from him
should be rejected.

173
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't do that.

174
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,480
It's delicious.

175
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,260
(Tripe (spicy flavor)
Meat Gathering gift pack snacks)

176
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,180
(Jian Yang,
CK Base in Luohu District, Shenzhen)

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,950
Guys, attention.

178
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,000
I think

179
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,680
we kept a good atmosphere this morning.

180
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,120
The club happens to
have just officially approved

181
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,120
the team's schedule I newly submitted.

182
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,920
Let's get started.

183
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,750
That means from tomorrow,

184
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,600
no sleeping in.

185
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,070
What time do we start training then?

186
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,390
Nine o'clock.

187
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Nine o'clock?

188
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,000
Set your alarm for 8 o'clock.

189
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,830
Even Shorty can
go to bed early and get up early.

190
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,950
What are you two complaining about?

191
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,240
That's right.

192
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,950
I need to get my beauty sleep.

193
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,720
Come on, let's get on with it.

194
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,160
Their tactics versus our tactics.

195
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,430
If their topsolo

196
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,480
chooses a shikigami dominating
in leading lines,

197
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,600
then it'll be crucial

198
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,390
to choose our shooter and midsolo.

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,240
It will determine the winner of the game.

200
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,160
Adjust your routine.

201
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,560
Get some early rest today.

202
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
Get up.

203
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,510
Get up.

204
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,600
Get up and train.

205
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,870
Let me sleep for five more minutes.

206
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,910
If you don't get up,
your salary will be deducted.

207
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Rui, that's inhuman.

208
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,240
Get up.

209
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,390
Get up.

210
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,480
The sun is shining,
the weather is beautiful.

211
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,790
A new day has begun.

212
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,670
Let's cut to the chase
and get back to business.

213
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,550
Today's first day of training. Take it easy.

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,390
Cat is more experienced
with physical training.

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,080
Let him lead the training today.

216
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,320
All right.

217
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,510
Since today is the first day,

218
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,080
we must activate the joints.

219
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
Wait until we sweat a little bit.

220
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,910
Come on.

221
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,510
Move your joints.

222
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,960
Wrists.

223
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
Ankles.

224
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,240
Almost there.

225
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,000
Are you ready?

226
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,750
- We're ready.
- Let's start with a jog.

227
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
Are you ready?

228
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,670
Yes.

229
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,630
Let's do it.

230
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,910
Come on.

231
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,870
No.

232
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,630
Run.

233
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,440
I thought it was a jog.

234
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Don't just look. Go on.

235
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,200
Come on, come on.

236
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm hungry. Where's Cat?

237
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,030
I may get a sunburn.

238
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,870
You are too short to be burnt by the sun.

239
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,840
Lu Sicheng.

240
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm so tired.

241
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,600
Poor thing.

242
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,000
Captain.

243
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,150
Can you talk to Rui?

244
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,270
This is not physical training.

245
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,910
It's clearly physical abuse.

246
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,840
(Who's begging Cheng
not to abuse her physically?)

247
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,670
(It's a girl's voice.)

248
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,750
(Is it Smiling?)

249
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Cheng.

250
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,720
Captain.

251
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,510
I'm on the air.

252
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,840
The whole world can see you.

253
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,600
(I made a screenshot.)

254
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,120
What are you doing?

255
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,030
Peek-a-boo?

256
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm on the air.

257
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,360
Let me see.

258
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm begging for Smiling to be on the air.

259
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,910
The kind with a camera on it.

260
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,150
Sooner or later, you'll be seen.
There is nothing to hide.

261
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,240
That's a good point.

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,270
Tong Yao?

263
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,630
No way.

264
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,750
Haven't you already signed
a live streaming contract?

265
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,270
Besides, you will be seen sooner or later.

266
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,270
What's the point of hiding?

267
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,670
This camera doesn't suit me very well.

268
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,600
Didn't you buy a beauty camera?

269
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,670
Screw you.

270
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,840
Remember your live streaming target.

271
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,910
You can make up for

272
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,870
forty-five hours in a day or two
at the end of the month.

273
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Unless you find someone
to kidnap Rui by then,

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,360
otherwise, he will still make a merciless

275
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,510
deduction of your monthly performance.

276
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,630
(Bought a beauty camera.)

277
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,840
(Which kind-hearted ghost just)

278
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,030
(hunted our Cheng?)

279
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
(Why is Cheng so thoughtful?)

280
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
(Tong Yao, hurry up
and start the live broadcast.)

281
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,270
(I'll shut down the live broadcast
if you keep yelling.)

282
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,720
Take a look at people's outcry.

283
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,670
Tong Yao.

284
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,840
It seems that you have to
open the live broadcast today.

285
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,750
Okay.

286
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,630
But you have to give me some time.

287
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,750
I need to get ready.

288
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,550
What do you need to prepare?

289
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,600
It's just a live broadcast.

290
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,960
And you're going to get all dressed up

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
like going to the Queen's dinner party?

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,960
Rui, please leave me alone.

293
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,790
All right, all right.

294
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,380
(Amao's Mom)

295
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,320
Fan's leader.

296
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,390
Let's get to work.

297
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,390
Hi, I'm looking for...

298
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,870
Hi, I'm looking for Tong Yao.

299
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,960
Hi, beauty.

300
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,150
Help me. Emergency.

301
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,080
Excuse me, friend.

302
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,360
Please close the door.

303
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay.

304
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,000
Why are you hiding?

305
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,750
Why do I feel that
you are poking me in the eye?

306
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,150
Look at yourself, my friend.

307
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,750
Your dark circles are coming out.

308
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,600
Without the concealer,

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,320
how can you pass the test
of a high-definition camera?

310
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,360
Sis.

311
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,840
Your skin is all dry

312
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,080
from staying up all night training.

313
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,630
I can't come over every time

314
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,670
to put on makeup for you.

315
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
Save yourself before
the next live broadcast.

316
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,670
Remember.

317
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,630
Take a mask every day

318
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,630
to get more water replenishing.

319
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,200
Yes. I'll follow the advice of my friend.

320
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,390
That's my girl.

321
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,440
I just saw Cheng downstairs.

322
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,030
He's really handsome.

323
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,320
I didn't expect you guys
to become a CP so soon.

324
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,840
What do you mean?

325
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,840
Don't talk nonsense.

326
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,910
How is it that I'm talking nonsense?

327
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,120
I witnessed the whole
"E-sports White Snake Legend"

328
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,000
as soon as I came back from abroad.

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,630
Don't talk about the past.

330
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,440
What, is Jian Yang still haunting you?

331
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,240
"The Place Where the Sun Blooms"
is back in the world.

332
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,670
Don't laugh.

333
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,440
Did you and Ai Jia make up?

334
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,550
Why should I make up with him?

335
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,390
I wouldn't have come
if I hadn't come to do your make-up.

336
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,550
If you want to settle with Ai Jia abroad,

337
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,840
you should just tell him.

338
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,360
How do you know he doesn't want to?

339
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,030
Does he have time to listen to me?

340
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,960
All he does every day is gaming.

341
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,080
I dare say

342
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,630
he must not want to give up his club.

343
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,910
Even if his salary is now a little higher,

344
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,360
can he still play forever?

345
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,240
And he hides in his room every day

346
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,790
like a vampire.

347
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,480
Who are you calling a vampire?

348
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,600
Even if you are,

349
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,320
you're still a cute vampire.

350
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,910
Is that okay?

351
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,750
Yes.

352
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,630
But what are you going to do now?

353
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,320
Since I've turned down a job offer abroad,

354
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,600
I'll try to find a job at home first.

355
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,270
I remember

356
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,630
didn't you have a part-time job
as a gaming host

357
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,670
when you were in college?

358
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,440
I was doing it for Ai Jia, all right?

359
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,240
I don't want to mess with this now.

360
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,000
But

361
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,550
I did get asked to fill in recently

362
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,670
to host

363
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,480
a national league draw.

364
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,960
National league?

365
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,150
Isn't that the league
I'm going to play in next?

366
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
You said yes?

367
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,270
I'm still thinking about it.

368
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,960
Close your eyes. I'll draw your eyeliner.

369
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,360
Close your eyes.

370
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,720
Here is your Smiling.

371
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,000
Why are you hiding?

372
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,390
Head up, chest up.

373
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,150
I made this face

374
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,630
not for you to look on the floor.

375
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
That's right, Tong Yao.

376
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,360
Why do you keep your head down
with such a pretty face?

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,270
You have a nice lipstick color.

378
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,080
What brand is it?

379
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,150
Lipstick?

380
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,600
Is she wearing lipstick?

381
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,870
How can I not tell it?

382
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,840
Carrot color.

383
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,870
It sets off her skin color.

384
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,910
Go conquer the world beautifully.

385
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,670
My work is done.

386
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,720
Miss, I'll see you off.
I'll open the door for you.

387
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,480
Tong Yao.

388
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,590
You look good.

389
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,240
Don't look so sad. Come on.

390
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,540
(I miss you. I really know I'm wrong)

391
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,510
Go up, go up, I've slipped away.

392
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,480
(Honey, forgive me, okay?)
Kill the snake. Kill the snake now.

393
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,270
Okay, okay. Good.

394
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,270
Good, good.

395
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,350
Get him.

396
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,920
Catch him.

397
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,160
Honey.

398
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,680
Honey.

399
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,550
What is it? What is it?

400
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,400
Honey.

401
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Honey! Honey!

402
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Honey.

403
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,830
Honey, I'm here.

404
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,350
Chubby.

405
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,720
Do I look okay like this?

406
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,270
Will I look too pale?

407
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
Tong Yao.

408
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,270
You've already adjusted it 800 times.

409
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,880
The official Microblog has been posted
for 10 minutes.

410
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,920
Do it.

411
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,940
(Camera not turned on)

412
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,220
(Watch on Mobile, Share, Follow)

413
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,830
There are so many people.

414
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,160
One, ten, one hundred, one thousand,
ten thousand, one hundred thousand.

415
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,590
300,000?

416
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,440
That's a lot of people.

417
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,790
Should I quit?

418
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,790
That's okay.

419
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,550
The number of live broadcast platforms
is illusively high.

420
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,510
There are probably
only 20,000 to 30,000 people.

421
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,480
Block anyone who calls me ugly later.

422
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,440
I depend on you to maintain my reputation.

423
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,110
Okay.

424
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,960
Can he block them all?

425
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,070
Cheng.

426
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,640
I advise you to be kind.

427
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,700
(Loading at full speed)

428
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,200
(- Three with two.
- I can't take it.)

429
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,310
(North Wind. I hu-ed. Big Four Winds.)

430
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,510
(Four twos. Jokers.)

431
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,830
(The most mysterious person in history
is about to reveal herself.)

432
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,270
(How should I pretend not to loathe her)

433
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,270
(ugly looks?)

434
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,680
(- I'm waiting online.)
- Go back.

435
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,880
(My wife, my God.)

436
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,030
(She is as good-looking as I thought.)

437
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,070
(You're really a woman.
My view of the world crumbles.)

438
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,550
Hello, everyone.

439
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,030
I'm Smiling.

440
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,270
Right.

441
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,030
I'm the chosen anchor who was little known

442
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,480
but is a professional now.

443
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,200
From now on, I'll see you all every month

444
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,160
in the studio.

445
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,720
Remember to subscribe to me.

446
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,750
I'm going to start playing the game.

447
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,680
Thank you.

448
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,020
(War on)

449
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,960
I won't be able to see the pop-ups
while playing the game.

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,160
What is invisible doesn't exist.

451
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm such a little smartass.

452
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,920
I can't believe they got

453
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,590
a schoolgirl to play the game.

454
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,640
Team ZGDX employs a child laborer.
I'll report it.

455
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,510
You don't look more than 1.6 meters tall.

456
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,440
It's so funny

457
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
to watch a schoolgirl playing
as a professional.

458
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,510
Lu Sicheng.

459
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,200
What are you doing?

460
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,480
Read the pop-ups.
I'm in the live broadcast.

461
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,480
Be polite.

462
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,880
Don't swear, kid.

463
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,590
I didn't say that.

464
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,550
Besides, Chubby swears every day.

465
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,270
He is hopeless.

466
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,000
You can chat.
Why did you mention me all of a sudden?

467
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,240
Don't read the pop-ups.

468
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,030
I will get distracted.

469
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,790
I'll die.

470
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,920
No.

471
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,480
Who is reading the bullet-screen comments?
It's Cheng.

472
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,350
Yeah, it's me!

473
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,310
My wife is not Oitsukigami anymore.

474
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,680
It's Smiling.

475
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,030
You probably need to see
an ophthalmologist.

476
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,030
If the brain department is less crowded.

477
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,350
I recommend you can also go.

478
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,880
What is he doing?

479
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,920
Smiling.

480
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,400
You look so good, so good, so good.

481
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,400
So cute, so cute.

482
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,350
So many.

483
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,480
Or go to the toilet
to eat something to calm down.

484
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,110
You think it's interesting to read
the bullet screen comments like that, right?

485
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,440
Yes.

486
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,640
Tong Yao obviously looks so cute.

487
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,550
Why do you play the game so fiercely?

488
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,160
In me, the tiger sniffs the rose.

489
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,510
How long are you going to read for?

490
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,830
Until I'm tired.

491
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,920
Can you adjust the height of the seat?

492
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
Sitting like this, you look so short.

493
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,240
The camera cannot
take a full picture of your face.

494
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,350
Only the forehead shot?

495
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,830
You don't know how to use
the e-sports chair, do you?

496
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,030
You don't know how to use
the e-sports chair, do you?

497
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,440
You…

498
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,480
Congratulations!

499
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,070
What a loss!

500
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,110
Rui,

501
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
you bought a black and white monitor
for Tong Yao?

502
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
How do I not know that?

503
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,960
Tong Yao in anger looks so cute.

504
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,750
Of course!

505
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,000
The puffer fish is also very cute
when it is angry.

506
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,920
Lost in the first round.

507
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Tong Yao, you used to be
a substitute fighter, didn't you?

508
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,160
A substitute fighter would be so poor.
Do you believe that?

509
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
What is your relationship with my husband?

510
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,310
Who is your husband?

511
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,880
Tell him to come over and let him talk to me.

512
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,960
You need Cheng to read the bullet
screen comments while playing the game.

513
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,030
Shame on you.

514
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,000
Did I ask him to read me
the bullet screen comments?

515
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,110
Who can buy a packet of dummy pills
and feeds it to him?

516
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I donate one yuan.

517
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,510
See my record here?

518
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,110
It's the result of reading
the bullet screen comments.

519
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,400
Shame on you!

520
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,750
Room administrator, time for work!

521
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,960
Ban this guy's account!

522
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,510
That's it for today.

523
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,880
The anchor is not too happy.

524
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,270
And needs to have some yogurt
to calm down.

525
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,350
Shorty,

526
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,070
send your

527
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,200
beauty camera brand

528
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,550
to Chubby later.

529
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,270
I…

530
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,030
Lu Sicheng,

531
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,200
were you a mute in your last life?

532
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,750
Really bought the beauty camera.

533
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,750
Tong Yao values her looks so much.

534
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,790
Lu Sicheng!

535
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:44,200
Tong Yao is really fierce.

536
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
(ZGDX's new midsolo
shows her face during live broadcast.)

537
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,980
(No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae on the Chinese server
is actually a cute girl)

538
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,580
(1 ZGDX new midsolo Smiling
is a cute girl)

539
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,380
(ZGDX's new midsolo
shows her face during live broadcast.)

540
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,900
(No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae on the Chinese server
is actually a cute girl)

541
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,460
(The most potential professional e-sports player
1. Smiling)

542
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:57,960
Cheng.

543
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,860
(Invitation: The Friendship Tournament)

544
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,240
Your former boss TAT is inviting us
to a training match.

545
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,440
Not now.

546
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,440
I see that Tong Yao is now quite positive.

547
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,680
She's doing well in training sessions lately.

548
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,550
- Maybe we can…
- No.

549
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,160
Tong Yao needs more training for a while.

550
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,350
Talk about it later.

551
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:13,920
Good.

552
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,790
You are the captain to obey.

553
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,240
Cheng.

554
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,070
From the pocket,

555
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,030
take out the candy.

556
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,110
It's Xylitol candy.

557
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,960
That won't work either.

558
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,160
And…

559
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,480
And…

560
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,200
Mrs. Lu has instructed

561
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,790
no candy is allowed.

562
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,880
Congratulations, Tai.

563
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,590
Once again, you led the TAT

564
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,590
to win the game again.

565
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,790
Can you reveal your next plans?

566
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,750
This year's World Finals, of course.

567
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,680
Previously, in last season's

568
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
Spring Finals,

569
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,350
you defeated the strong opponent Ox
in one fell swoop.

570
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
So in today's Onmyoji tournament,

571
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,350
do you have any other players worth noting?

572
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,510
Our team gave the opponent's region,

573
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,270
many seniors before, right?

574
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,880
Although they are very powerful seniors,

575
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,350
there are always newcomers
in the South Korean arena.

576
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,160
So we are not very afraid.

577
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,550
I noticed that…

578
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,880
I heard that they recently
recruited a female player.

579
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,960
I am quite interested.

580
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,830
They just don't give me a chance.

581
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,030
I heard that the customs of
the Chinese arena

582
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,720
are not quite the same.

583
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,310
What they may focus on

584
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,110
may not be just things
like competition results.

585
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,640
Maybe the female players are there to

586
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,720
increase the popularity of the team.

587
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,830
She is not that powerful.

588
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,270
Of course they not dare to ask her to fight.

589
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
You mean the ZGDX

590
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,960
declined your invitation to a training match?

591
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
Doesn't that mean they are afraid?

592
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,350
Really?

593
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,920
What's the Chinese saying?

594
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,960
"A turtle retracting its head into its shell."
<i>*Coward</i>

595
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,660
(Tai expresses his opinion on
ZGDX's new midsolo, Smiling is challenged)

596
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
(Tai is not easy to deal with.)

597
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,160
(I guess Smiling also knows)

598
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,240
(her own capability, right?)

599
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,440
(It turns out)

600
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,510
(the whole team is given)

601
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,880
(the label of "Coward".)

602
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,400
(Immediately arrange
a training match with TAT.)

603
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,200
(What are you waiting for,
when the public opinion is like this?)

604
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,830
(Mr. Li…)

605
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,310
(But Cheng said…)

606
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,200
(It's decided.)

607
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,790
(Make a reply by
the official Microblog this afternoon.)

608
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,480
(Got it.)

609
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,350
(ZGDX e-sports club has accepted
TAT's invitation to training tournament)

610
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,310
- ZGDX is so tough.
- Looking forward to Smiling's performance.

611
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,790
(Tong Yao will participate in this training match)
Tai is so arrogant.

612
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Hurry to frustrate him.

613
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,510
As I said,

614
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,160
it is not the time to make
a training match with TAT.

615
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,480
But they have openly provoked us.

616
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,000
And we have been training for so long.

617
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,830
Tong Yao…

618
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
should have already adapted.

619
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,550
Why did they provoke?

620
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,310
They must have heard some rumors.

621
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Now the club PR says to the world that

622
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,720
our new midsolo is unbeatable
in the training match.

623
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,960
To prove our strength to South Korea,

624
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,240
just call their operator team.

625
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,960
Why must we respond to TAT?

626
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,830
This is the decision of
the club's general manager.

627
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,030
I can't argue with that.

628
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,720
Now the public opinion out there
believes that

629
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,440
ZGDX members are cowards.

630
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,400
We can't really be one, can we?

631
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,070
Just one lost game.

632
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,440
Before the start of the new season,

633
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,110
strong teams in the two regions
can know something about each other.

634
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
That's good!

635
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,160
Sooner or later, we will have to face TAT.

636
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,070
Tai is different.

637
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,680
It's not as simple as just losing a game.

638
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,790
The club has made a schedule.

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,750
It is designated that Tong Yao
must attend this match.

640
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,400
Well, whatever you want.

641
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,790
Anyway, in case of a problem,

642
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,240
don't ask me to clean up your mess.

643
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,000
You're too protective of her, aren't you?

644
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,440
You protect her every time.

645
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,000
As for the previous
E-sports White Snake Legend,

646
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
just speak directly on the internet.

647
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,750
The club came to me.

648
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,590
I dealt with it.

649
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,070
But now you even don't allow
the training games.

650
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,240
It's really inexplicable.

651
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,590
You know very well that

652
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,200
the improvement learnt
in a training game against

653
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,030
a powerful South Korean team
before the season

654
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
will surely prevail over that
which we can get

655
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,510
from a game against domestic teams,
those inferior to us, right?

656
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,350
And what's wrong with losing a game?

657
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
It will not destroy our confidence, right?

658
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
I really don't understand you.

659
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,720
Lu Sicheng,

660
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
you really like Tong Yao, don't you?

661
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,550
Unexpectedly,
you even like preying on those nearby.

662
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,750
I won't answer such a question.

663
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,720
Think about

664
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,550
whether what you just said is funny.

665
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,510
So the reason you are so protective of her

666
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,270
is that she's a little girl.

667
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,750
You think it's difficult for her
to achieve nowadays achievements.

668
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,680
You're afraid that she will be eliminated
from the club if she loses the game.

669
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,270
Rui.

670
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
If Shorty hears you say that,

671
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,350
probably she will jump up
and hit you on the head.

672
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,200
When will you stop talking about "Shorty"?

673
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,240
I don't see her as a little girl,

674
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,200
so there is no sympathy,

675
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,310
and no mercy.

676
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,830
Let alone thinking that

677
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
it was difficult for her
to achieve current achievements.

678
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,550
I took her for

679
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,160
the newcomers that
the team can use in the future.

680
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,880
It was hard to let her know

681
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,160
the importance of professional athletics.

682
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,680
She just integrated into the team.

683
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,160
This circle is complicated and

684
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,310
full of all kinds of people.

685
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,240
Like her, who only wants to play the game

686
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,270
and achieve good performance,

687
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,550
it's really hard to find.

688
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,550
So I don't want her to

689
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,830
be stopped by something

690
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,720
which should have been avoided halfway

691
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,720
before she becomes the best one.

692
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,350
I… I'm a little confused.

693
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,240
As for Tai,

694
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,920
when I was in the TAT team,

695
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,590
he's famous for his bad temper.

696
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,480
Calling him that

697
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,510
does not mean that he's so strong

698
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,400
or so professional.

699
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,640
Rather, he is more like
a midsolo quality inspector

700
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,400
without any mercy.

701
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
Once the TAT team wanted to
develop newcomers.

702
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,270
Those midsolo alternates,

703
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,750
after the training match with Tai,

704
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
some of them gave up on the career
after being beaten by him,

705
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,750
and others could not recover after a setback
and remained in the secondary league.

706
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,830
There are still many teams in South Korea

707
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,400
which refuse to pick up
a training game with TAT.

708
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
It's for this reason.

709
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
He deems powerful team members

710
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,030
as enemies.

711
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,350
In his eyes,

712
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,680
the so-called training matches

713
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
do not mean a technical exchange at all.

714
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Rather, he is only interested in
testing the strength of the other side

715
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,110
and whether they can fight him.

716
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,200
I sometimes feel

717
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,590
if this guy doesn't play
the professional game

718
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,830
and works in other industries,

719
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,830
he will probably also be

720
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,270
a cold and powerful person.

721
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,590
Did you know the Star Team

722
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,400
called as Star of Celebrities?

723
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,750
I know, Ox and his team members.

724
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,440
At that time their output was really strong.

725
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,070
They won the championship.

726
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,310
The game company also

727
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,000
customized a season
commemorative skin for them

728
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,830
in memory of that

729
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,440
they have been unbeatable that season.

730
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,350
But haven't they already retired?

731
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,270
In last season's Spring Finals,

732
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,270
Tai uses this skin

733
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,550
while passing the middle lane

734
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,510
to send his opponents to heaven in person.

735
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Tai is like this.

736
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,000
This time
the other party's intention is obvious.

737
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,000
Does he have some intention towards

738
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,830
first female professional player
with the title

739
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,070
of No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae in China?

740
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,510
(Why can this female anchor sign ZGDX?)
Tong Yao is a newcomer.

741
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,180
(Smiling can't be underestimated)

742
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,750
She joined the team with
a good training competition score,

743
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,000
a lot of striking operations

744
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,440
and confident and aggressive skills.

745
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,160
She also talks back.

746
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,510
Confidence is good.

747
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,200
It's fear that makes people feel annoyed.

748
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,590
She's being praised to the hilt outside.

749
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,590
They admire her extremely.

750
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,110
If this kid gets frustrated,

751
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,480
she will soon collapse

752
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,960
as she is not resistant to setbacks.

753
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,200
This is the reason
why I disagree with the club's

754
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,830
decision to let Tong Yao compete with him.

755
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,440
Cheng.

756
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,880
Tai would do these things to Tong Yao

757
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,510
in our training match?

758
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,680
He'll use Tamamo-no-Mae to defeat Tong Yao.

759
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,550
It's his best stratagem.

760
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,640
Prefers to take the opponent's best hero

761
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,960
to beat the opponent hard.

762
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,720
But Tong Yao is the best Tamamo-no-Mae player
on the Chinese server.

763
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,350
She won't necessarily lose.

764
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,110
That's the title he's running for.

765
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,920
He wants everyone to know

766
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,830
who is the world's No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae.

767
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,680
I was wrong.

768
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,880
I should have argued with the club.

769
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,750
I have to protect Tong Yao.

770
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
I told you, you would apologize.

771
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,160
This is not the time to talk about it, right?

772
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,510
So what do I do now?

773
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,000
Should I go and refuse a training match?

774
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,880
Cheng is right.

775
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,350
It is really not appropriate
to let Tong Yao play now.

776
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,240
But the official Microblog has made a reply.

777
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,590
There's no way to back out.

778
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,830
But being called coward is too bad, right?

779
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,110
Rui is also in a dilemma.

780
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,400
Yes, yes, yes.

781
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,590
I have to tell Tong Yao.

782
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,640
No.

783
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,590
What's up, Cheng?

784
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,350
Is it fun?

785
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,880
I didn't mean to do it.

786
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,200
I said,

787
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,880
I didn't hear anything.

788
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,590
Do you believe it?

789
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,960
How much did you overhear?

790
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,400
No eavesdropping.

791
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
Only a little.

792
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,920
You said I got good grades,

793
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,400
and made striking operations.
I am a good talent.

794
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,920
It's hard to find another.

795
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,110
And that I'm a gem.

796
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,880
What?

797
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,030
So is it true?

798
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,880
You said I was a gem.

799
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,640
I have been your teammate for so many years.

800
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,480
I haven't heard you praise me before.

801
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,510
You have a share of
the stepping stones in the latrine.

802
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,750
Wake up!

803
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,960
Wake up.

804
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,110
What's the matter with you two
standing eye to eye?

805
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,030
Romeo and Juliet?

806
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,350
It was just cleared up that
you two have nothing.

807
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
Then we hear the praise of gem and star.

808
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,880
Glacier melts.

809
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,590
Iron tree blooms.

810
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,440
The spring of a withered tree.

811
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
A group of stupid-idiots.

812
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,110
Let's get back to the point!

813
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,590
Now that you've heard it all,

814
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
we won't hide it from you.

815
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,880
This time Tai very likely

816
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,830
comes for you.

817
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,400
Just think about Ox.

818
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,880
I don't want you to be beaten to get retired.

819
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,750
just after signing
the professional qualification.

820
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,110
After all, you were selected by me.

821
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,400
I haven't attained national champion yet.

822
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,440
How can I retire?

823
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,880
It's not late to refuse.

824
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,510
Running away is shameful but useful.

825
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,110
I'll talk to the club about it.

826
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,440
No.

827
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,830
Rui, do not go.

828
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,920
I'll be the pretty girl who enforces justice.

829
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,920
Since one day we will face it,

830
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,920
running away from the problem
will not solve anything.

831
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,790
Being defeated now

832
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,110
is better than being beaten
on the real field.

833
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,110
- And...
- Yeah.

834
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,240
Even if he takes Tamamo-no-Mae,

835
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,270
I'll win.

836
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,640
Very optimistic.

837
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,400

(Being Banned)

839
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
It's not too late to ban Tamamo-no-Mae.

840
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,070
The opponents ban three midsolo roles.

841
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,400
It seems that he does not want to
give you a way out.

842
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,440
It's okay, I can use Higanbana.

843
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,480
Good.

844
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,750
Then ban Chin.

845
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,840

(Selecting)

847

Tamamo-no-Mae immediately.

If you want to take Higanbana.

851
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,070
Must pay attention to development.

852
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,760
Do not directly fight against
his Tamamo-no-Mae.

853
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,840

Forget it.

857
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,030

you should keep developing.
