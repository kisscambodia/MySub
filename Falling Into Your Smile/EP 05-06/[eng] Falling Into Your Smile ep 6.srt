1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,040
All he cares about is e-sports.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,600
He may have a rather high salary now,

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,710
but can he make a lifetime career
out of e-sports?

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,630
Once a little known but talented live streamer,

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,880
now a professional player.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,960
(No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae player on the Chinese server
shows her face in a live stream)

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,910
Coward.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,000
Cheng.

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,320
Tai would do these things to Tong Yao

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,710
in our training match?

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,960
He'll use Tamamo-no-Mae to defeat Tong Yao.

12
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,550
It's his best stratagem.

13
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,640
But Tong Yao is the best Tamamo-no-Mae player
on the Chinese server.

14
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,600
She won't necessarily lose.

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,760
Running away is shameful but useful.

16
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,030
I'll be the pretty girl who enforces justice.

17
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,280
Even if he takes Tamamo-no-Mae,

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,470
I'll win.

19
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,240
You're quite optimistic.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,140
(For professional players,)

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,740
(e-sports is...)

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,400
You pulled an all-nighter?

27
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
I'll be there soon.

28
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,840
You spent the whole night playing
Tamamo-no-Mae?

29
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,400
I thought you said you were fine.

30
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,630
I lied.

31
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,000
I am not fine.

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm deeply troubled.

33
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,870
I can see that.

34
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
I can't play Tamamo-no-Mae well.

35
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,070
I'm not the No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae player
on the Chinese server.

36
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
Little liar.

37
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,540
(ZGDX screwed up.
Look how lame its new midsolo is.)

38
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,600
I accidentally observed

39
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,480
the training match
between ZGDX and TAT on video.

40
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,310
As you know,

41
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,070
this video was not supposed to be made.

42
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,870
It must have been released on purpose.

43
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,270
Anyway, ZGDX lost miserably.

44
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,750
The other team's Tai used
Tamamo-no-Mae to crush Tong Yao.

45
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,390
Tong Yao became the weak link.

46
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,870
I can see her teammates tried so hard
to turn the tables.

47
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,830
But Smiling

48
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,560
was just inept and weighing the others down.

49
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Look how the "new hope for the Chinese side"

50
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,000
you praised in the last few days

51
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,000
is performing now.

52
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
(Her opponent used the same shikigami as her)

53
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,870
(and completely destroyed her.)

54
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,000
(She is lame.)

55
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,600
When she wins, you praise her.
When she loses, you insult her.

56
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,120
You certainly have a way to cope.

57
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,310
One training match doesn't mean anything.

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
Besides, it couldn't have been an accident

59
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,480
that all her victories were not observed

60
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,920
and her only defeat was observed.

61
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,630
TAT's motive is questionable.

62
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,750
Why do few people like this team

63
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,270
even though it won many championships?

64
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,920
It's time to ponder this question.

65
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,510
(Pope and Cheng were right)

66
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,870
(to leave TAT in succession.)

67
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,120
(I'm sure their fans are relieved.)

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,160
(It is contradictory)

69
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,720
(to like a player)

70
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,270
(and hate his team.)

71
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,720
(You were the one who sang its praises.)

72
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,190
(After it defeated a bunch of
weak Chinese teams,)

73
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
(you showered it with compliments)

74
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,630
(How laughable.)

75
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,040
(Does it hurt you to know you were wrong?)

76
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,390
ZGDX is really unlucky

77
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,630
to have taken this weak midsolo in.

78
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Please get Ming's substitute
midsolo Lyu back.

79
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,700
(Smiling was crushed. Are those who called her
the new hope for the Chinese side)

80
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,630
(feeling embarrassed now?)

81
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,600
My goodness.

82
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,920
TAT is just vicious.

83
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,720
Why did it post

84
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,870
the training match video online?

85
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,190
First, there was provocation

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
that forced the club to respond.

87
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,560
Then it targeted Tong Yao

88
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,680
and posted the video online

89
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,750
to lure the netizens
into cyberbullying our new midsolo.

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,190
It's such a shameless act.

91
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,270
Despicable. Shameless.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Biscuit,

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,680
your mom is having a mood swing.

94
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,750
Be good.

95
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,310
This is my fault.

96
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,270
I should have stood my ground
against the club.

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,160
Now others have bullied her.

98
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,950
Soon after she joined our team,

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Tai crushed her like that.

100
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,630
Maybe she'll never recover from this setback

101
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
and lose the courage to play again.

102
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,870
Has she shut herself off?

103
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
She has been in her room for the whole day.

104
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,070
If she really is this vulnerable,

105
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,000
then she is not suited
for a professional e-sports career.

106
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,310
She is new, after all.

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,510
This must be the first time

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,270
she has suffered this kind of setback.

109
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,430
As her teammates,

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,830
we should be more understanding.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,360
Yes.

112
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,390
- She is just...
- Yeah.

113
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,950
...a young woman in her early 20s.

114
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
We need to protect her

115
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,160
and care for her.

116
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,190
K, did you hear that?

117
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,480
Protect and care for her.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,070
Is she a Class III protected animal

119
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,070
like the giant panda?

120
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
She doesn't need care and protection.

121
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,600
E-sports is unrelated to gender.

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,750
Wait.

123
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,830
Class III?

124
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,390
The giant panda
is a Class I protected animal?

125
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,800
Look.

126
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,080
I told you.

127
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,150
(They signed a female member for hype.)

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
(Any team that wants to win
will fight for Pope.)

129
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,000
(To draw attention,
they even refused to let Lyu return.)

130
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,390
(Let me tell you a joke.)

131
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,840
(The Chinese Tamamo-no-Mae player)

132
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,750
(was crushed by
the other Tamamo-no-Mae player.)

133
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,910
(ZGDX will never beat TAT.)

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,870
(TAT will remain the champion this year.)

135
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,870
(The Chinese Tamamo-no-Mae
player is utterly weak.)

136
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,270
(At least those in favor of ZGDX only started to
praise it after it won multiple matches in a row.)

137
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,480
(Now you poor wretches)

138
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,790
(saw them lose just one training match)

139
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,080
(and couldn't help criticizing them.)

140
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,270
(You must have suppressed
yourselves for a long time.)

141
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,550
(All that holding back
must have made you uncomfortable.)

142
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,870
(You find happiness in criticizing people.)

143
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,600
(You take delight in slandering people.)

144
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,720
(TAT will remain the champion?)

145
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,480
(If the Chinese team wins,)

146
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
(will you live-stream
your trip to the toilet)

147
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,630
(where you will eat something)

148
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,840
(and cut off something?)

149
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,030
Is she still sleeping upstairs?

150
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,120
Yeah.

151
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,630
We haven't seen her all day.

152
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,080
This can't go on.

153
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,870
It was just a training match.

154
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,080
I'll go and talk to her.

155
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,910
Rui, I'm going out.

156
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,910
Jinyang wants to see me.

157
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,960
You'll come back, right?

158
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,200
Don't stay out late.

159
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,600
You're a girl. Be careful outside.

160
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,480
It's good for her to hang out,

161
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,720
away from the internet at this time.

162
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,670
You saw what happened.

163
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,790
Someone posted

164
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,670
the training match video.

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
Nobody will be willing to
train with them now.

166
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
That's why they don't have
training matches with other teams.

167
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
Usually, they just split into two groups
and compete with each other.

168
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
A bunch of jerks.

169
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,080
I think Tong Yao is fine now.

170
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,550
She looks fine.

171
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,200
But she must be hurting on the inside.

172
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,910
She has been here for a while,

173
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,750
but that was the first time
she trained all night.

174
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,440
Right.

175
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,150
I saw the dark circles under her eyes.

176
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,720
Heaven knows when she went to bed.

177
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Half past five in the morning.

178
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,270
You lost points.

179
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm just playing for fun.

180
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,790
(Don't come back too late.)

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Welcome.

182
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,480
We made reservations.

183
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,080
Alright.

184
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,600
Come here.

185
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,630
Stop wallowing in depression.

186
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,670
Cheer up.

187
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,120
Sit down.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
See what you would like to order.

189
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,750
Thank you.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Take a look. What do you want to drink?

191
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,510
I can't drink alcohol.

192
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,720
I don't mean for you to drink alcohol.

193
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,510
I took you out to lighten your mood.

194
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,720
Make your pick.

195
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,030
Here.

196
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,790
Alright.

197
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,270
Long Island Iced Tea.

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,080
I will have this.

199
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,030
Two glasses of Long Island Iced Tea.

200
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,870
Understood. Just a second.

201
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,630
Long Island Iced Tea can make you strong.

202
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Strong?

203
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,480
You just lost a training match.

204
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,670
When Ai Jia just started to participate in
professional competitions,

205
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,360
he was so young and inexperienced

206
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,550
that he often suffered
emotional breakdowns after losing.

207
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,320
He cried in the balcony

208
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,550
to keep me from finding out.

209
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,030
He was such a crybaby.

210
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,440
But a day after the cry,

211
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,270
he began revving himself up

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,360
for the next match.

213
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,480
I couldn't hold the tears in either.

214
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,960
I cried for the whole morning.

215
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,320
You said you were not weak a moment ago.

216
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,080
Alright.

217
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,670
There is no shame in crying
as a young woman.

218
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,790
I cried hideously and someone saw it.

219
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,630
What are you mumbling about?

220
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,270
Take it easy.

221
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,630
How could you be so impetuous?

222
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,510
That's very wild of you, Miss.

223
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,960
Come here. Drink with me.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,960
Drink with me.

225
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,750
Who are you?

226
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
Just one drink.

227
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,630
Come here.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,790
What are you doing?

229
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,030
Who are you?

230
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,870
Piss off.

231
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,510
What a lingering nuisance.

232
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,600
Why does he know we are here?

233
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,550
Who knows?

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
He must have a sense of smell
as keen as that of a dog.

235
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,440
After I put makeup on you the other day,

236
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,790
he caught me.

237
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,910
Ai Jia.

238
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,270
Can you please control the look in your eyes?

239
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,790
Honey.

240
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,440
Honey.

241
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,390
Honey.

242
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,870
Yang.

243
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,600
Babe.

244
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,870
You.

245
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,790
Move away.

246
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,550
Wait until I finish talking to my friend.

247
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,670
Yao.

248
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,960
Every e-sports player

249
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
faces losses as well as victories.

250
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,320
Obviously, you don't win every game.

251
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,750
It was just a training match.

252
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,510
You still have a chance
in the National League.

253
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,910
Don't care about others' opinions.

254
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,200
Here is an idea.

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,320
I can pay some people

256
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,240
to throw the insults back at your haters.

257
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah.

258
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,200
Everyone loses at some point.

259
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,910
I don't know that guy Tai.

260
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,840
But don't worry,

261
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,080
if I ever compete with him,

262
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,240
I'll avenge you.

263
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,240
Shut up.

264
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,750
Nobody wants to hear you talk.

265
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,440
She is perfectly capable of
taking revenge on her own.

266
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,750
She doesn't need you to avenge her.

267
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,390
That's not what I mean.

268
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,840
I just told you to move away.

269
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,600
Go.

270
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,550
My friend,

271
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,910
how can I

272
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,790
cheer you up?

273
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,480
How about

274
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,440
I treat you to a beefcake show

275
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,240
like that in Las Vegas?

276
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,910
(Come quickly. Your opportunity is here.)

277
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Then again,

278
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,630
I don't understand why Tai

279
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,750
can affect you professional players so deeply

280
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,150
by using the shikigami
you are good at playing

281
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,000
to defeat you.

282
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,630
Ox retired because of this.

283
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,440
I didn't expect the same thing
to happen to Tong Yao today.

284
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,240
Logically,

285
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,200
you should be infuriated that
you were defeated

286
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
by someone using the shikigami

287
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,750
you were good at playing.

288
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,200
That's not what this is about.

289
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,670
In order to use a shikigami adeptly,

290
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
you need to analyze the shikigami's skills

291
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,600
and employ the techniques proficiently.

292
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
You also need to understand the whole game.

293
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,440
So you'll feel greatly frustrated

294
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,600
once you lose.

295
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,790
You still don't understand?

296
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,150
Let me put it this way.

297
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,150
You'd been good at English since childhood.

298
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,120
You outshone everyone around you.

299
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,080
You could even communicate
with foreigners smoothly.

300
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,720
Every time the school
organized a speech event,

301
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,790
you were there to participate.

302
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,670
You were the legendary English learner
in this city.

303
00:16:59,390 --> 00:16:59,910
Then one day,

304
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,200
you won first prize
in a municipal competition

305
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,790
and moved on to participate
in a national English summer camp.

306
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,920
You found that every participant

307
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,160
was as good as you.

308
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,350
When some of them spoke,

309
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,640
you had to wrack your brain

310
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,070
trying to figure out
what they were talking about.

311
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,680
As you felt confused and lost,

312
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,400
they turned back and mocked you.

313
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,240
They said, "You are not qualified

314
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,510
for the summer camp."

315
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,790
What would you think?

316
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,960
Let me put it another way.

317
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,070
A group of people
who spoke different foreign languages

318
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,920
attended a party.

319
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,070
One of them spoke perfect Japanese.

320
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,680
You could barely understand
what he was saying.

321
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,960
What would you think?

322
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,960
You would think,

323
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,480
"This person speaks perfect Japanese.

324
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
But what does it have to do with me?

325
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
I don't speak Japanese anyway."

326
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,070
If you put it that way...

327
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,510
So, what Tamamo-no-Mae means
to Tong Yao is...

328
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,960
What?

329
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,440
Never mind.

330
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
As a professional player,

331
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,790
she'll go through this sooner or later.

332
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,340
(Heading to your destination, SOHO Bar.)

333
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,960
Stop reading the negative things.

334
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,790
I brought you here to have fun.

335
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,550
Quit drinking.

336
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,830
Excuse me,

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,480
can I have one more glass of iced black tea?

338
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,350
Sit down.

339
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,830
What you had was not iced black tea.

340
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,400
It was Long Island Iced Tea.

341
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:41,920
Jian Yang?

342
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,480
What is he doing here?

343
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,830
You snitching bastard.

344
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,350
Are you so eager to meet your doom?

345
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Come here.

346
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,750
But...

347
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,160
Come here.

348
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,750
- Come here.
- What do you want?

349
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,640
They can be together. We can be together.

350
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,880
This is nice.

351
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,200
Yao, stop drinking.

352
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,480
Go away.

353
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,790
Come on, let me take you away
to wash your face.

354
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,750
Get some fresh air.

355
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,790
I won't live-stream

356
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,160
or compete or perform on stage.

357
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,160
Why should I wash my face?

358
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,830
Who are you?

359
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,030
It's 11 o'clock.

360
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,310
Why is Tong Yao still not back?

361
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,680
Did that silly girl jump into the sea?

362
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,750
(Tong Yao)
(SOHO Bar. Come quickly.)

363
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,920
Why did you message Lu Sicheng?

364
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,240
I already got Jian Yang here.

365
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,270
Maybe they will get back together tonight.

366
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,790
When did I allow that to happen?

367
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,830
A lying and cheating man

368
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,270
doesn't deserve to be with my bestie.

369
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,830
That was a misunderstanding.

370
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,680
Jian Yang has always loved Tong Yao.

371
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,110
Don't claim it is a misunderstanding.

372
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,590
Besides, Tong Yao doesn't
love Jian Yang anymore.

373
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,440
If that's the case,
why did she become a professional player?

374
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,830
Her professional e-sports career
has nothing to do with men.

375
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,920
Moreover,

376
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,240
if they loved each other,
why did they break up?

377
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,200
We love each other,
but we almost broke up too.

378
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,160
It's normal for lovers

379
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,830
to break up and get back together.

380
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,070
Anyway, I'm on Jian Yang's side.

381
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,880
Jian Yang is my friend.

382
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,480
Tong Yao is my bestie.

383
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,030
A good woman should choose
a man worthy of her.

384
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,030
It's enough to have one of us

385
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,270
go blind.

386
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,160
Blind?

387
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,070
Who is blind?

388
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,880
I am.

389
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,310
Really?

390
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,030
Let me see.

391
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,960
Let me have a look.

392
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,920
You don't look blind.

393
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,680
Piss off.

394
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,680
Yao.

395
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,510
I know you're feeling down

396
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,510
after losing the match.

397
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
But you shouldn't use alcohol

398
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,790
to numb yourself.

399
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,830
You also shouldn't turn those
who care about you away.

400
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,110
I've thought a lot these days.

401
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,200
I made mistakes in the past.

402
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,070
I shouldn't have lied.

403
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,830
I shouldn't have been annoyed by you
and avoided explaining.

404
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,200
Now I understand.

405
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,880
Yao.

406
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,030
I can't live without you.

407
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,550
Without you,

408
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,030
I couldn't play games well.

409
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
I read every piece of news about you.

410
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,240
and felt terrible

411
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,720
whether you were faring well or not.

412
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,510
When you were faring well, I felt terrible

413
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,160
because I was not the one
who made you happy.

414
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,240
When you were not faring well,

415
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,550
I wanted to be with you.

416
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,640
I know I should tell you this

417
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,240
when you are sober.

418
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,030
But I can't help it.

419
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,480
Give me one more chance.

420
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,550
Let's get back together.

421
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,680
Okay?

422
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,640
Where is my phone?

423
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,510
Where is my phone?

424
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,400
Here it is.

425
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,110
Come here.

426
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,880
Give them some space.

427
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,030
Tong Yao is feeling awful right now.

428
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,200
This is all because

429
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
you Internet addicts are outrageous.

430
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,070
Chen Jinyang.

431
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,030
You can insult me.,

432
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,590
but don't call me an Internet addict.

433
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,000
I might sue you for libel.

434
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,310
How dare you talk back?

435
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,240
You spent every day using the computer.

436
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,590
Of course you are an Internet addict.

437
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,510
Programmers use the computer
every day too.

438
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,030
We are professional players.

439
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,270
We are athletes.

440
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,030
We are not fooling around.

441
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,510
Professional players?

442
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,640
Is your future promising?

443
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,510
I don't appreciate that coming from you.

444
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,680
My future is certainly promising.

445
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,000
I fight to win honor for the country.

446
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,030
Don't be mad.

447
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,510
Yao.

448
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,070
What are you looking at?

449
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm looking at

450
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,960
my grandpa's comment.

451
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,590
Who would name their accounts like that?

452
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,350
Stop reading.

453
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,480
Let them say whatever they want.

454
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,960
We'll just do our job.

455
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,200
Come on. No more drinking.

456
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,960
I'll take you home.

457
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,070
Jian Yang.

458
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,400
You don't know me at all.

459
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,200
You have no idea what I care about.

460
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,030
I don't care

461
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,200
what the netizens say.

462
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,680
Those haters can't beat me.

463
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
I'm bothered

464
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,750
because of what Tamamo-no-Mae

465
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,110
means to me...

466
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,110
- Are you okay?
- Jian Yang.

467
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,510
Jian Yang, what's the matter with you?

468
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
How did you make her puke?

469
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,400
She said I didn't know what she cared about.

470
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,790
Even I know what she cares about.

471
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,400
You care about the fact

472
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,510
that another player used the shikigami

473
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,880
you're good at playing to defeat you, right?

474
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,030
I understand this feeling.

475
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,030
You don't understand anything.

476
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,310
Mom, I lost my baby tooth.

477
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,070
The upper one or the lower one?

478
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,480
If it's the upper one,
I'll toss it under your bed.

479
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,750
Captain, you're finally here.

480
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,550
Hey, wake up.

481
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,720
Someone is here to pick you up.

482
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,350
I think I'm seeing our captain.

483
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,790
He is glaring at me fiercely,

484
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,640
as if he would throw me into the sea.

485
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,270
I'll set sail and scoop your corpse
out of the sea.

486
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,070
How did she get so drunk?

487
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
She was feeling down

488
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,000
and I worried she might start reading
the netizens' comments again

489
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,440
if she had nothing to do.

490
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,240
I didn't expect her to get drunk.

491
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,310
That's not true.

492
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,000
I drank iced black tea.

493
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,720
Shut up.

494
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,550
Why is he being stern in my dream?

495
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,750
I'm taking her back.

496
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,270
I can take Tong Yao back.

497
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,240
I'm the captain of her team.

498
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm obligated to send her back to
the team's base.

499
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,480
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

500
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,400
Ex. That means you are
not her boyfriend anymore.

501
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,550
Come on.

502
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,350
What are you up to this time?

503
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,070
I want to send Tong Yao back.

504
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,880
Cheng can do it. You are not needed.

505
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,790
Should I let them be with each other alone?

506
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't feel easy about it.

507
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,000
Jian Yang.

508
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,240
You and Tong Yao have broken up already.

509
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,750
My slipper... My slipper fell off...

510
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,480
Where is my slipper?

511
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,590
In my hand.

512
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,880
I want to wear it.

513
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,070
You're not walking. Don't bother to wear it.

514
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,350
Stop or I'll shake you off.

515
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,720
You're so mean.

516
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,790
Cheng,

517
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,240
why are you always so mean?

518
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,270
Can't you be kind?

519
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,400
Carrying you is the kindest thing I can do.

520
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,680
Shorty.

521
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,680
Do you know

522
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,680
that it is normal to lose and win?

523
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,030
I know.

524
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,960
You told me that.

525
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,920
Do you know

526
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,550
that other people's insults

527
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,790
won't stop you from becoming

528
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,960
an exceptional e-sports player?

529
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,680
I know.

530
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,750
That's why I don't care

531
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,960
about the haters' comments at all.

532
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
Cheng,

533
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,070
I didn't cry because of my defeat

534
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,790
or the comments

535
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,480
or my self-esteem.

536
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,750
I just didn't like being a burden
to my teammates,

537
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,790
feeling anxious, uneasy,
self-abased, conceited.

538
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,200
Can I really be a good professional player?

539
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,070
Do I really know how to play this game?

540
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,920
Do I really know how to play Tamamo-no-Mae?

541
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,350
Jian Yang and the others don't understand

542
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,310
that Tamamo-no-Mae is actually my...

543
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,440
Faith.

544
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,030
Yes.

545
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,680
Cheng.

546
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,310
Now my faith has crumbled.

547
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,000
What should I do?

548
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,880
How about you resolve to win

549
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,790
and find a new faith?

550
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,920
It's not that easy.

551
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,750
You'll never know until you try.

552
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,830
I'll know if I try?

553
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,400
You should know

554
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,160
that Ming picked you

555
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,000
from hundreds of people.

556
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,480
Are you questioning his judgment?

557
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,750
I can teach you.

558
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,160
Cheng.

559
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,350
You're lying.

560
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,790
You are such a good player.

561
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,830
You'd never let yourself
be humiliated in this way.

562
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,310
You can't teach me stuff like this.

563
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,400
You're so proud.

564
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,000
Why aren't you talking?

565
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,510
I'm starting to think
that your words make sense.

566
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,350
Wake up.

567
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,000
If you go back like this,

568
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,000
Rui will chide you for certain.

569
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,160
I'll buy drugs to sober you up.

570
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,200
Wait here for me.

571
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,200
Why are you glaring at me?

572
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,640
You once dragged me like this.

573
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,880
And you almost pulled me down.

574
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,110
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

575
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,750
Are you going to fall?

576
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,750
Are you going to fall?

577
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,720
Are you going to fall? Are you?

578
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,240
No.

579
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,830
Give me five minutes.

580
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,000
So what if you have long legs?

581
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,720
It takes me ten minutes
to walk from this place

582
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,920
to the entrance of the residential area.

583
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,310
What if a lecher shows up?

584
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,240
No lecher would take an interest in you.

585
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,270
Right.

586
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,070
Go now.

587
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,920
I'll stay here.

588
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,790
From now on, I'll be like Wei Sheng.

589
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,550
I won't leave until you come back.

590
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,680
You seem more cultured when you are drunk.

591
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,160
You just referred to
a character from a classic.

592
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,070
Fine. Hug that thing tight, Wei Sheng.

593
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,000
Idiot.

594
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,640
I'm not drunk.

595
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,200
I don't need any drug to sober up.

596
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,830
I just talked to you about my dreams.

597
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,680
I'm as sober as I can be.

598
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,400
Wake up from your sleep, guys.

599
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,790
I'm back.

600
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,550
I'm back.

601
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,350
I'm back.

602
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,830
Cheng.

603
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,070
I thought you left to buy me drugs.

604
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,030
How come you came back earlier than I did?

605
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,270
A ghost!

606
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,900

What are you doing?

609
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,680
Cheng, there is a ghost in the base.

610
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,640
There is a ghost who looks

611
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,240
exactly the same as you in the base.

612
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,240
He is very scary. I'm terrified.

613
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,920
Get off me, drunkard.

614
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
No, there is a ghost in the base.

615
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,350
Get off me.

616
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,070
No.

617
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,240
Tong Yao.

618
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,310
I hope you won't admit what you did today

619
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,030
after waking up tomorrow.

620
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,590
What if I admit it?

621
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,310
I will have peace for a month.

622
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,920
You are short and unattractive.

623
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,030
How come you weigh more than 50 kilograms?

624
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,310
You're as heavy as a pig.

625
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,440
I'm retracting my hands.

626
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:37,880
No.

627
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,200
One. Two...

628
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,030
You wouldn't dare!

629
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,590
What are you doing here?

630
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,070
What?

631
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,510
You are not a ghost?

632
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,680
Have you seen such a handsome ghost?

633
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,350
You two look alike.

634
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,680
We have the same parents.

635
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,030
Of course we look alike.

636
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Lu Yue.

637
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,030
Ming.

638
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,110
Tell us why you came back.

639
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,640
I was going

640
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,310
to start for Kenya

641
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,680
and observe the great animal migration

642
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
when I found on the internet

643
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
that Tai crushed Tong Yao,

644
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
the latest addition to your team.

645
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,750
I heard that he destroyed that poor girl.

646
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,350
I was not destroyed.

647
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,350
I'm pretty good.

648
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,680
At that time, a voice

649
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,160
occurred in my head.

650
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,310
"Lord Lu Yue,

651
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,160
it's time to go back
and be a professional player."

652
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,270
So,

653
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,960
you're Tong Yao,

654
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,400
the player who got destroyed by Tai.

655
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,200
Did I say you could ask questions?

656
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,310
I just want to know.

657
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,960
The way you came in with her

658
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,360
made me think she was your girlfriend.

659
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,760
I almost messaged our mother
to announce the great news.

660
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,840
Her eldest son actually prefers women.

661
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,710
She'll get to

662
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,800
sleep tight.

663
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,800
Shut up.

664
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,110
You are frivolous as usual,

665
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,840
Lu Yue.

666
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,840
But I'm telling you,

667
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,590
we have a new midsolo now.

668
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,630
You came back late.

669
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,630
What do you mean by "late"?

670
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,400
I was banned from competing.

671
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,760
It'd have been pointless
if I'd come back sooner.

672
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,630
What?

673
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,030
You got banned?

674
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,960
It served you right. I'm so happy.

675
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,070
Can someone get this lunatic under control?

676
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,000
Hey,

677
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,110
I've heard that ZGDX

678
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,670
hasn't chosen a starting midsolo

679
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,280
for the National League.

680
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,480
Ming, I would like to compete.

681
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,150
No.

682
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,960
I'll message our mother then.

683
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,510
Mom,

684
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
the weather has turned cool lately.

685
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,360
I dropped by Cheng's team base

686
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,360
to give him a thermal outfit.

687
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,630
Then I saw Pope,

688
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,710
the guy involved in
a romantic scandal with him.

689
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,110
He came all the way to China for Cheng.

690
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,960
And I caught him lying in the bed with Cheng.

691
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,150
They were smooching.

692
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,510
Don't you dare send that message.

693
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,590
I'm serious.

694
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,400
You'll run into TAT again sooner or later.

695
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,150
You shouldn't rely on Tong Yao,

696
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,710
namely this lady,

697
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,800
to regain confidence
in the official competition

698
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,070
and defeat the player
who had shattered her hope once.

699
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,710
You'd better smarten up

700
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,920
and get a substitute player

701
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,590
who can counter Tai's moves,

702
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,400
and that is

703
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,630
me.

704
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,440
It's true that dreams are important,

705
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,670
and exciting stories
about rising in adversity

706
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,150
fill people's eyes with tears.

707
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,440
But sometimes people

708
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,840
should face reality.

709
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,320
You don't win a trophy

710
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,280
by shouting slogans

711
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,070
and performing the goose step. Am I right?

712
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,400
Am I going back to being
the substitute for the substitute?

713
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,920
Am I going to be the only

714
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,110
starting midsolo who can't play

715
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,800
and can only watch as the substitute?

716
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,960
Am I never going to play

717
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,110
in the National League?

718
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,190
I don't want that.

719
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,510
I want to play in the National League.

720
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,280
You can't make me a substitute.

721
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,840
I just lost one match.

722
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,190
I don't want to see the water dispenser.

723
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,190
Tong Yao, how much alcohol did you drink?

724
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,110
I didn't drink alcohol.

725
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,590
I drank iced black tea.

726
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,710
I'm not drunk.

727
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,920
Cheng,

728
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,710
I want to be a professional player.

729
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,840
I want to take revenge.

730
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,710
I'm very competent.

731
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,440
You can't make me see the water dispenser.

732
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,030
Cheng, exactly how much did she drink?

733
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,960
I don't know.

734
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,150
We'll report the bar across the street

735
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,030
for selling alcoholic drinks
to an underage customer.

736
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,400
We can check the surveillance footage.

737
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,280
Cheng,

738
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
this is for you.

739
