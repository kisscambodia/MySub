1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,520
What?

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,640
A girl?

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,870
A girl is joining the ZGDX team,

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,360
eating, living and playing with my Cheng?

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,670
Seriously?

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,640
It really is a girl.

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,880
Oh, my god!

8
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,320
A girl plays professionally?

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,600
Is ZGDX going crazy?

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,920
They were so shorthanded

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,800
that they went to find one at random?

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,440
Some unknown anchor

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,800
is to take the place of Ming?

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,030
A female to boot...

15
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,760
This operation of ZGDX

16
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,640
will surely cause a loss of fans.

17
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,510
Where is the base located?

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,830
I'm going to pounce on them.

19
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,540
(Girls playing pro is hilarious.)

20
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,440
The No. 1 player,
Tamamo-no-Mae of the Chinese server?

21
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,220
Are they bluffing?

22
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,300
(Female anchors can make money
by their faces why bother actually working?)

23
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,390
This chick Tong Yao
must be targeting my Cheng.

24
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,140
(I want to play pro too.)

25
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,390
ZGDX is crazy about being famous.

26
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,750
That woman is old enough to be your mother.

27
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,920
Why can't she play?

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,740
=Falling Into Your Smile=

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,580
=Episode 2=

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,760
Hello?

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
Yao, just look at
what these people said on the Internet.

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,760
So harsh.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,070
Whatever.

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,080
I have been through enough to survive this.

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,310
Just ignore them.

36
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,240
I'm starving.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Didn't eat anything all the way.

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm just angry for you.

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,280
I dare say,

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,190
none of the people who said those things

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,590
could beat you in a game.

42
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,150
But do not argue with them.

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,680
Be careful of being targeted as
my fans' leader.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,000
What about being a fans' leader?

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,960
You're gonna let someone else
be your fans' leader?

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,030
My dear Tong Yao.

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,430
(Ai Jia)
Let me know when you arrive at the base.

48
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,590
I'll pick you up.

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
My wife blocked me.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,190
Could you talk some sense into her for me?

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Our team is right next to your ZGDX.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,030
You really aren't gonna let me
be your fans' leader?

53
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,710
It's not that.

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,680
Ai Jia just sent me a message.

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,470
He said their base is right next to ZGDX.

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
He's gonna come down and pick me up.

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,080
What is he up to by being so attentive?

58
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,240
He wanted me to persuade you

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,310
to remove him from the blacklist.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,310
Don't even think about it!

61
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm one of my words.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,190
Don't even bother.

63
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,800
If you dare to help him.

64
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,840
You'll join him on the blacklist.

65
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,080
I wouldn't dare.

66
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,400
Anyway, do you think my teammates

67
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,680
will welcome me joining?

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,590
Of course.

69
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,310
You are all equals.

70
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,870
Why pick on you?

71
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,190
It's not the age for sexism.

72
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,030
Your joining ZGDX

73
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,150
will only make them all wake up laughing.

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Well then.

75
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,240
Will they welcome Biscuit too?

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,630
Have you ever heard of the story of
the golden and silver axes?

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't be too greedy.

78
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,120
All right.

79
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,190
Just enjoy your e-sports life.

80
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,910
Bye bye.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,470
The No. 1 player Tamamo-no-Mae of
Chinese serveris joining the ZGDX team.

82
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,430
This is the beginning of a break
with the traditional pattern.

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
Following the North American arena

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,190
admitting female professional players
into the final for the first time,

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,750
The Chinese arena's ZGDX
followed closely behind.

86
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,960
The e-sports industry farm
also retweeted this one.

87
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,840
Who is this Tong Yao?

88
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,630
What makes her qualified to succeed Ming?

89
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,910
The ZGDX has taken a lot of time and effort

90
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,710
to impress and convince Tong Yao

91
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,750
to join the ZGDX team

92
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,430
as the first female professional player
in the Chinese arena

93
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,870
since the start of the Battle of Heiannkyou,

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,560
and promised her a starting position.

95
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,120
Look, K.

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
The ZGDX actually found a woman
to play the first.

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,030
We're so screwed.

98
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
Tong Yao indicated,

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,180
(Chinese server's No. 1's player
Tamamo-no-Mae is joining the ZGDX team.)

100
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,680
that professional gaming
has nothing to do with gender.

101
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,190
She didn't quite understand why

102
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,190
it has always been boys
who were at the top of gaming.

103
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,000
She also stated outright

104
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,630
that if you really want to do something,

105
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,120
girls wouldn't do it badly either.

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,950
Have you finished yet?

107
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,160
Is she your relative or something?

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,270
Too much talking.

109
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,750
She is not your enemy either.

110
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,750
Why being so mean?

111
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,720
Shut up. It gives me a headache.

112
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,480
Cheng.

113
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,870
Captain.

114
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,870
My CV boss.

115
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,680
The girl is our new midsolo.

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You have to pay some concerns.

117
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,870
Maybe she'll be here tomorrow.

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,680
I heard she'll bring
a furry little animal with her too.

119
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,510
It's probably my takeout.

120
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,630
Captain, please open the door for me.

121
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,920
K. What are you doing?

122
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,510
Use my other account to comment.

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,390
I don't like her either.

124
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,680
Lu Sicheng,
why is it you who opened the door?

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
- Thanks.
- I...

126
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,830
I am Tong Yao.

127
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm so hungry.

128
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,070
Cheng, you aren't playing another game?

129
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,630
It's too dumb to play
with the general players.

130
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,950
I can't bear to let them
use me to score points.

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
They've died more times than I've killed.

132
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
Cheng is very grumpy today.

133
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Cheng.

134
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,390
Just suck it up.

135
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
The data will be reviewed
the day after tomorrow.

136
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,800
If you don't want your pay docked,

137
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,190
there are at least a hundred points
more to go.

138
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,310
Plus three advanced competitions.

139
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,600
Cheng is hovering at the line.

140
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,630
Stop struggling.

141
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,510
A rank is dropped.

142
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,920
Twenty percent of the monthly salary
will be deducted.

143
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,510
Ever since this rule came out,

144
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,950
Cheng has never received

145
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,950
his full salary.

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,310
Let's not be headstrong, Cheng.

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,430
Being headstrong costs you money, man.

148
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,680
Our Cheng is rich, that is no big deal.

149
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,920
This isn't right, Cheng.

150
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,510
This isn't the takeout I ordered.

151
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,100
(One notification from Weibo)

152
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,460
(Maiden salt fish smiling)

153
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,120
I came to ZGDX
to enroll and knocked on the door.

154
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
It was Cheng who opened the door.

155
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,190
Then he took my takeout,

156
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,270
said thanks and then shut the door.

157
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,270
So now I'm standing
in front of the door once again,

158
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,160
with my Biscuit.

159
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,310
Hahaha!

160
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,390
Cheng took Tong Yao as a delivery girl.

161
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
Delete that tweet.

162
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,830
No.

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Delete that tweet.

164
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,800
I won't.

165
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,950
For the last time, delete that tweet.

166
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,360
You apologize first.

167
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,920
I have never seen Cheng being
picked on in my life.

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
Give the new girl my thumbs up.

169
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,920
Yeah, impressive.

170
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,720
Everyone is so diligent today.

171
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,430
You finished the meeting before I got here?

172
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
Rui, I'm here to enroll.

173
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,070
Hey, you came!

174
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,000
Let me give you a formal introduction.

175
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,190
This is Tong Yao.

176
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,360
Rumor has it that she reached
the top of the Chinese Server at the age of 19.

177
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,310
At 21, she ranked as the head of Kyoto
in the South Korean Server.

178
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,310
Standing on the shoulders
of ninety-nine percent of boys,

179
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,390
She is a talented Mid-lane girl.

180
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,920
Save the press lines please.

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
That's too much, Rui.

182
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,480
Anyway.

183
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,720
Tong Yao has officially replaced Ming

184
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,190
as our new midsolo from today on.

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,120
Welcome.

186
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,480
Although you probably know them all,

187
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll do the introduction anyway.

188
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,270
This is our topsolo, Cat.

189
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
He is straight as an iron rod,

190
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,390
and can beat the crispy guys
on the other side who

191
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,120
tremble with fear in game.

192
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,480
Welcome.

193
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
It's just that his arc of reflection
is a little long.

194
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Just ignore it.

195
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,430
Who did you say has a long reflecting arc?

196
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,360
Sorry. I've been exercising
a little too much lately.

197
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,160
It's okay.

198
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,310
This one is our support.

199
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,120
Just call him Chubby.

200
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
He's our nanny in the team.

201
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
A pure and harmless fat game nerd.

202
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,390
You can say I'm a nerd.

203
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,600
But calling me fat is going too far.

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,950
I just have more weight.

205
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,240
Hello, Miss Tong.

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
Don't come to me if there's any problem.

207
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,750
When free, we can play games together.

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,070
No problem.

209
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,510
And that is K,

210
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
Our jungler.

211
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,190
Despite his looks,

212
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,390
he is actually living in his own head.

213
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,000
With him,

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Ming could walk unscrupulously

215
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,430
in front of the opposing midsolo.

216
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,830
That's because Ming was there.

217
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,510
If it was someone else,

218
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,830
things are not necessary.

219
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,070
Next one,

220
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,310
I don't think
he needs any more introductions,

221
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,240
our shooter.

222
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,750
I heard you just shut her out.

223
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,310
I thought she was a delivery girl.

224
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,600
A delivery girl would dress like that?

225
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,360
And hold a cat?

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Why not?

227
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,390
So I closed the door.

228
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm sorry I didn't get all dressed up.

229
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,360
He's so mean,

230
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,830
being judgmental
about other people's clothing.

231
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,270
Do you have something to say?

232
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,040
I didn't say anything.

233
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,190
Your face tells me

234
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,270
that you have something to say.

235
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
Being judgmental
about other people's minds too.

236
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,120
What kind of
horrible character setting is this?

237
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,030
Anyway, let me introduce.

238
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,910
This is my cat. Its name is Biscuit.

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
So?

240
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,030
So can I call you Cheng?

241
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,000
Your cat's name is Biscuit.

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
What does that have to do with my name?

243
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Those are two different questions.

244
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,750
Keep an eye on your furry little animal.

245
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,360
I've asked Rui.

246
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
No one in the base is allergic to cat hair.

247
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,320
That's why I brought it with me.

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,000
Actually there's one.

249
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,150
Who?

250
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,750
My son.

251
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,540
(Si Cheng Sicheng)

252
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
Cheng, that's not allergic.

253
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
It is called the food chain.

254
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,000
You can't suppress the nature of a kitten.

255
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,600
What if her cat eats my son?

256
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,600
Buy another one.

257
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,480
It's not like you can't afford it.

258
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,960
If you try to not lose
so many points and get fined,

259
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,480
you'd have enough money
for your children and grandchildren.

260
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,390
Cheng, relax.

261
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,840
I'll keep my eyes on Biscuit

262
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,150
and make sure
you'll have a house full of children.

263
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,670
Okay, okay, okay.

264
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,150
Any more and Cheng will lose his temper.

265
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
Come on, Miss Tong.

266
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,720
Let me show you your room.

267
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,030
- Okay.
- Let's go.

268
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,840
You take it from here, Chubby.

269
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,870
OK.

270
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you laughing at?

271
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,240
What you just said about
having a house full of children.

272
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,150
Not funny?

273
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
Take a look, Miss Tong.

274
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,200
How's this?

275
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,320
This was all carefully arranged by me.

276
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,000
The room Rui had decorated before

277
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,630
was a straight man's way of fashion.

278
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,030
What do you think of this one?

279
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,510
I specifically picked out the girl's specials

280
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,150
from the Internet for you.

281
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,870
Girl's specials?

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Have you got the wrong idea about girls? Bro?

283
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,910
Miss Tong.

284
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
Look at this.

285
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,150
I searched hundreds of stores

286
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,000
to find this.

287
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
It's a four-piece suit

288
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,600
with both pink ruffles and lace.

289
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,260
- Nice huh?
-This lace and this pink.

290
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,270
(Four-piece cotton bedding with pink ruffles
and lace in Korean style.)

291
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,910
Did Peppa Pig eat it and spit it out?

292
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,030
And this.

293
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,840
Look at this one.

294
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
(Cute romantic maiden style feathered lamp)

295
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,360
How fluffy!

296
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,000
It's blinding me.

297
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,240
And look at this.

298
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Flamingo special tender style for girls.

299
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,000
How beautiful they are!

300
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,180
(Simulated flamingo decoration)

301
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
Miss Tong.

302
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,870
How is it? Is it nice?

303
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Yeah.

304
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,870
Told you so.

305
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,790
You're the first girl
ever to play professionally

306
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,960
and join our team.

307
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
It's our honor.

308
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,150
So we have to take good care of you.

309
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,870
Give you special attention.

310
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,080
Okay.

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,750
I think he's tired, too.

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
Just take your time cleaning up.

313
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,200
Go to bed early.

314
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll leave you alone.

315
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,200
By the way,

316
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,780
there's a team manual
on the table for you.

317
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,480
(ZGDX I Team Manual)

318
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,030
But it doesn't matter if you don't read it.

319
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,080
Tomorrow Rui

320
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,000
will walk you through the routine.

321
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,670
Bye bye.

322
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
Bye bye.

323
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,150
Miss Tong.

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Welcome to ZGDX.

325
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,440
Go get it!

326
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,000
Bye bye.

327
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,480
First day on the team.

328
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,630
Cold Cheng.

329
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,960
Passionate Companions.

330
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,600
Amazing bedroom.

331
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,630
Ha, ha, ha.

332
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,720
Actually, I'm glad to be here.

333
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Tong Yao, go!

334
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,020
(The Happy Family)

335
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
Dad, Mom, I'm at the base.

336
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,750
Sending love.

337
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,540
(Dad, Mom, I'm at the base. Sending Love.)

338
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,140
(Mom has changed the group name
to "The Unhappy Family")

339
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,620
(The Unhappy Family)

340
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,200
Can the door be locked?
Take a picture for me to have a look.

341
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,150
It can.

342
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,360
This is a formal training base.

343
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,390
Take a picture of the door lock.

344
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,860
(Dad waiting for a response from Dad)

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,510
Yao, how's your room?

346
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,270
Dad.

347
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,480
We're fine here.

348
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,270
Look,

349
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,150
this is the room my teammates
decorated for me.

350
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,790
Although,

351
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
But,

352
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,550
It's kind of thoughtful.

353
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,390
This door looks pretty solid.

354
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,000
But I think this window

355
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,630
is a little insecure.

356
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,720
Come on, dad.

357
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,790
What's not safe about this window?

358
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
You might as well seal it all up.

359
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,720
Your daughter's here for games,

360
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,960
not some kind of secret job.

361
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,870
Look at you,

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,750
I was worried about you,

363
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,510
concerned about your safety.

364
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,550
I haven't finished my sentence

365
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,960
and you've already started talking.

366
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,390
You have the same personality

367
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,270
as your mother.

368
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,670
Don't get me involved.

369
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,200
Her impulsive temper is not like mine.

370
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
Dad.

371
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,360
Mom's still mad?

372
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,480
She's been angry all day.

373
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,910
She didn't even cook for me.

374
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
Don't talk nonsense.

375
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,120
Didn't you eat your porridge?

376
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,960
Has the ghost been eating it?

377
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,000
Isn't that porridge left over from yesterday?

378
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,600
Are the leftovers from yesterday
no longer food?

379
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,840
And then,

380
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,550
why was there porridge left yesterday?

381
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,390
Let me ask you.

382
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,790
wasn't it because of your little girl.

383
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,000
Your precious little girl
who left without hesitation.

384
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,270
All right, she's already gone.

385
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,080
What's the point of bringing it up again?

386
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Why can't I?

387
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm her mother.

388
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Why can't I bring it up?

389
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,440
I'd say it's all your fault.

390
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,080
Why did you let her go?

391
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,960
And leave the bank job behind?

392
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,320
She got the internship already.

393
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,630
We even made all the arrangements.

394
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,550
People asked me,

395
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,510
What's your daughter's job?

396
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,320
Playing video games.

397
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,030
Why does a college graduate

398
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,630
play video games for a living?

399
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,670
Why are you talking about this
on the phone call?

401
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,870
She is young and not settled down yet.

402
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,440
It's not unusual for her
to want to play a little bit.

403
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,150
If she really wants to try,

404
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,910
just let her try.

405
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,720
Maybe in two or three months
she will come home.

406
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,120
Is that right, Yao?

407
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,510
- Dad...
- Besides,

408
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,630
Our family is not short of

409
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,720
- a few months' salaries from her.
- Mom.

410
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,270
Are you out of your mind?

411
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,870
It's so hard to find a decent job these days!

412
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
It's not like you don't know that.

413
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,960
Besides, Yao,

414
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,790
You're a fresh graduate.

415
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,720
Do you know

416
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,150
how much this first job means to her?

417
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,200
Playing video games.

418
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,600
Is playing video games even a real job?

419
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,550
Does it have the five social insurances
and the one housing fund?

420
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,360
Yeah.

421
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,910
Yes, it has.

422
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,720
You see,

423
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,670
It has insurance.

424
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,910
It has.

425
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,750
- I'm not as good as you.
- Mom.

426
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,240
Well.

427
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,750
I don't know how to educate kids, okay?

428
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,910
Come on.

429
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
What are you doing?

430
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,790
What are you doing with the phone?

431
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,670
I'll talk to Yao a little more.

432
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,320
What do you have to say?

433
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
I'll say what's important.

434
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,360
It's all because of you.

435
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,440
What's so important, huh?

436
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
You always speak contrary to me.

437
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,360
You're always out of tune with me.

438
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,390
Yao has been coddled by you since childhood.

439
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,630
Biscuit.

440
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,790
The formal training starts tomorrow.

441
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,750
Are you looking forward to it?

442
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,980
Get up at eight thirty.

443
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,790
(The ZGDX's daily schedule)

444
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,840
Nine o 'clock physical training.

445
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,060
No joking around
and negative coping during training.

446
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,600
(The ZGDX's training rules)

447
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,480
Offenders will be fined 1,000 yuan.

448
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,000
(Training summary must be made
and submitted to team coach at the end of each day.)

449
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
(Failing to submit once,
a warning will be issued, twice, ¥1000 fine)

450
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,700
(Three times, one month's salary.)

451
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,780
(The ZGDX's Training Rules)

452
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,180
(The ZGDX I Team Manual)

453
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,880
Good morning.

454
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,680
How come there's no breakfast?

455
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
Who are you?

456
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,070
Little girl.

457
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,510
Who are you?

458
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,030
I just arrived yesterday.

459
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,680
Little girl, listen to me.

460
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,110
Don't mind my droning.

461
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
I advise you,

462
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,590
just pack up and go.

463
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,550
There is one rule for this team.

464
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,590
Girlfriends are not allowed here.

465
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,960
Last time someone brought his girlfriend,

466
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,070
the result was,
he was docked half a month's wages.

467
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,750
Girlfriend?

468
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,000
No, no, madam.

469
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
You're mistaken.

470
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,550
I'm nobody's girlfriend.

471
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
I am the new member of the team.

472
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,480
A member?

473
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
A woman?

474
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,200
A woman.

475
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,270
Madam.

476
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Are you going to cook breakfast?

477
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,960
These are the materials for lunch.

478
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
Lunch?

479
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,790
Don't we have to get up
at 8:30 in the morning?

480
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,880
At half past eight?

481
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,920
These kids are working hard.

482
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,400
They trained late last night.

483
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,880
I'll be glad to see them up by 12:30 today.

484
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
There are no mornings
for those who play e-sports.

485
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
I'd advise you

486
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,960
to get some rest, too.

487
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
They'll play games with you in the afternoon.

488
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,000
Madam.

489
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,750
Are you the only one

490
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,350
cleaning such a big base?

491
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,110
I usually do the cooking and the cleaning.

492
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
As for the professional jobs
of cleaning appliances,

493
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,200
they're going to go online
and find people to do it.

494
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,030
Girls are playing e-sports now.

495
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,640
Congratulations to ZGDX for winning

496
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
the 2019 Onmyoji Arena Pro League

497
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,640
Spring Playoffs Championship.

498
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,480
At the same time,

499
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,310
Let us also congratulate Lu Sicheng

500
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,750
on being crowned the MVP of the competition.

501
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,420
(If you win, they praise,
if you lose, they blame.)

502
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,880
Good morning.

503
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,830
Good morning.

504
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,440
Your superman shorts are quite nice.

505
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,110
What's for breakfast?

506
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,830
The same old things.

507
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,550
Good morning.

508
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,720
Good morning.

509
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,550
Good morning.

510
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,830
Good morning.

511
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,720
Good morning, Cheng,

512
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,030
Good morning.

513
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,790
- Oh my God.
- Why's he running away?

514
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,510
That's stimulating.

515
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,070
What do you think?

516
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,750
Too stimulating.

517
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,200
Where's everyone?

518
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,920
Come here.

519
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,030
Ming, you're back.

520
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,200
What did the doctor say?

521
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,240
Nothing.

522
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,000
Hello, Tong Yao.

523
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Hello, Ming.

524
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,790
Is your hand any better?

525
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,070
Much better.

526
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,830
Cut the crap and get to the point.

527
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,030
Although Ming has retired,

528
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,720
he won't be leaving us.

529
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,880
From today,

530
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,750
he is officially

531
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,240
the team coach of ZGDX.

532
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,960
I knew it.

533
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,790
Ming couldn't bear to leave us.

534
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,070
I am back,

535
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,880
and I never left.

536
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,590
Ming.

537
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,680
I still miss the days
when you played middle lane.

538
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,750
Now our midsolo is Tong Yao.

539
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,310
I will try my best.

540
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,960
The National League is coming up.

541
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,270
I'll work with Ming

542
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,440
to supervise your training.

543
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,790
Alternating work with rest,
maintaining a regular routine.

544
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,590
Starting tomorrow.

545
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,680
No one is allowed to sleep in.

546
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,160
Early to bed and early to rise.

547
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,000
You better wake up early
to watch the TV series.

548
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,480
I...

549
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,880
I didn't know
we can't watch TV shows at the base.

550
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
There's no such requirement.

551
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,750
You can do whatever you want on your breaks.

552
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,200
Right? K.

553
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,200
Funny.

554
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,790
K.

555
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,000
I'll go talk to him.

556
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,880
Don't mind him.

557
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,720
Ming has been
the midsolo all the time.

558
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,240
He's also been on the team the longest.

559
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,270
So his retirement

560
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,920
was a sad thing for all of us.

561
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,960
Especially to K.

562
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,160
He was recruited by Ming.

563
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,200
So he only trusts Ming.

564
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,720
Ever since Ming's retirement,

565
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,070
It's like he's been menstruating.

566
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,960
And he also acts odd.

567
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,590
All right, go train.

568
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,310
Come with me, Miss Tong.

569
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,070
Okay.

570
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,590
Let's go. Perfect.

571
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,680
You.

572
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,350
Come.

573
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,720
How did you feel on your first day?

574
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,920
Not bad.

575
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,790
It's just that Chubby's Superman

576
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,110
and Cheng's bathrobe costumes

577
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,270
blinded my eyes.

578
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,070
I didn't expect them

579
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,160
to act so freely while I was away.

580
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,790
You can read the team manual a little more.

581
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
It contains the detailed rules
and regulations of our team.

582
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,830
Also, the club has rules

583
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,920
that each team member

584
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,640
must broadcast live 45 hours per month.

585
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,960
You're going to
meet your live performance KPI.

586
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,720
Here is the contract. Please have a look.

587
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,880
By the way,

588
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,110
Which platform
did you broadcast live from before?

589
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,200
You didn't sign a contract, did you?

590
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,070
It's Xingfan.

591
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
But I haven't signed a contract yet.

592
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,270
Oh right,

593
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,160
I've never shown my face on air before.

594
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,240
So I just want to ask,

595
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,000
can I wear a face mask for live streaming?

596
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,510
Wear a face mask? Why?

597
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,750
Wearing a face mask
for live broadcasting feels safer.

598
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,310
You're full of lies.

599
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,160
All right, then wear a face mask.

600
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
But in the later competitions

601
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,480
and the seasonal photo shoot,

602
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,350
if you always wear a face mask,

603
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,750
I'm sure someone will ask,

604
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,440
Is this girl here to play games

605
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,240
or to play some

606
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,640
mysterious urban girl drama?

607
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,880
Sooner or later your face will be seen.

608
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,030
What's there to hide from?

609
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,920
And then,

610
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,070
This is work.

611
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
You have to have the courage
to face your fans.

612
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,790
Okay.

613
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,700
(Party B: Tong Yao)

614
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,640
It's done.

615
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
Here, this is for you.

616
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,830
Let's get down there.

617
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,550
Okay.

618
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,400
Let's go.

619
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,590
Let me tell you.

620
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,310
In fact, our team is very developed.

621
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,160
You don't know, do you?
In addition to season results,

622
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,550
our team is also very popular.

623
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,160
You see, the facilities and equipment here
are first-rated.

624
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,030
Enough.

625
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:33,920
Rui.

626
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,350
You should arrange someone to take her

627
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
to the supermarket later.

628
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,960
Indeed!

629
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,510
It's her first day here today.

630
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,160
She'll need to
get some groceries or something.

631
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,310
I would've forgotten
if you hadn't mentioned it.

632
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,350
I'll really have to arrange it.

633
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,240
Cheng, how about you take her?

634
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,160
I think I just said

635
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,750
you can assign someone.

636
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,510
Yes, I assigned you.

637
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,830
I'm very busy.

638
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,240
Too busy losing points?

639
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,160
You've been demoted to Shaoyun, my friend.

640
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
That's why I'm busy.

641
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,920
There will be a monthly assessment
in two days.

642
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Two days to upgrade
from Shaoyun to Lord of Kyoto?

643
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,480
Cheng, you think you are some god?

644
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,420
(Breaking of the ward,
practice in private room, no onlookers)

645
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,110
Let's go.

646
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,350
- Bye-bye, Rui.
- Come home early.

647
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,720
Come on, let's play together.

648
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,960
Wait for me, Cheng.

649
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,640
May I call you Cheng?

650
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,960
You could even call me Dad if you want.

651
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,680
I advise you to be a man.

652
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,960
Didn't you call me that long ago? Shorty.

653
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,590
Hurry up.

654
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,510
Wait for me.

655
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Who are you calling Shorty?

656
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,350
We met by chance.

657
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,880
Just relax and be kind, man.

658
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,070
Why are you so hostile?

659
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,830
Because I didn't expect

660
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,310
my future teammate would be a minor.

661
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,720
I'm 22. I've graduated from college.

662
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,510
Your height tells me you're lying.

663
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,440
Deleted that tweet.

664
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,510
No.

665
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,270
You shut me out in the first place.

666
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
And you called me shorty.

667
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,480
The tweet is on top.

668
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,310
Tong Yao.

669
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,590
Ai Jia.

670
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,420
(Cute boyfriend, Ai Jia
Midsolo, the composed midsolo)

671
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,540
(The boy next door, Liang Sheng,
Support, the YQCB team captain)

672
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,160
Tong Yao,
you didn't even tell me when you arrived.

673
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,590
It was your ex-girlfriend
who ordered me not to contact you.

674
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,000
You two know each other?

675
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,590
We went to the same university.

676
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,640
He's three years older than me.

677
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,920
His mother was my teacher.

678
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,110
His ex-girlfriend is my best friend.

679
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,310
Did I ask you that much?

680
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,030
Cheng.

681
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,350
Is this

682
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,440
the Miss Tong Yao who tweeted about

683
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,880
being locked out yesterday?

684
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,750
Tong Yao is the only girl

685
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,750
among the professional players.

686
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,510
Cheng.

687
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,400
Can you stop that painful face of yours?

688
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,920
Anyway, Miss Tong.

689
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,920
My name is Liang Sheng.

690
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,270
The captain of YQCB.

691
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,270
Our team is right next door.

692
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,070
You're welcome to have meals with us.

693
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,790
That's great.

694
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,270
Do not corrupt us with food.

695
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
One Chubby is enough.

696
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,830
By the way,

697
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,270
Let's do a battle before the National League.

698
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,270
No problem.

699
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,510
Wait until our new guys are in place.

700
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,480
I'll arrange with Rui.

701
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,920
Seems that you have recruited some new aids?

702
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,000
What position?

703
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,200
Shooter.

704
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,110
Wait for the official announcement. Big news!

705
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,160
Who is it?

706
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,440
I don't know.

707
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
Tong Yao.

708
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,240
Just put in a good word for me
with your best friend.

709
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,920
At least pull me off the blacklist.

710
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,830
Or tell me why she broke up with me.

711
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,750
I can only tell you,

712
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,110
your ex-girlfriend has turned down

713
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,030
three offers from abroad to come home.

714
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,110
And you only focused on

715
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,680
how many tips
you get for doing the live streaming.

716
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,680
Shorty, get in the car.

717
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,790
Oh my god.

718
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,480
Do all the pros drive this?

719
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,920
What?

720
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,200
You're used to Uber

721
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,200
and don't know how to open the door yourself?

722
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,750
No, no. I'll do it myself.

723
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,110
Cheng, all I need is a pair of slippers,

724
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,400
some daily toiletries.

725
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,310
You can go to any mall around here.

726
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,310
Or what? Take you to the furniture store?

727
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,440
Really?

728
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,550
You missed me?

729
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,880
You want me to pin you down
by the water cooler,

730
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,750
and make you watch me bring home
one trophy after another?

731
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,550
In your dreams.

732
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,270
The other day at the spring finals,

733
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,550
Rui said you were there too.

734
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,510
Yeah.

735
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,720
You were staying at the same hotel as us.

736
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,480
Yeah.

737
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,310
The forty-sixth floor.

738
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,960
Yes.

739
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,270
No.

740
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,310
That stubborn shorty
the other day was really you.

741
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,270
No.

742
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,640
You stubbornly refuse
to admit that you were short.

743
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,400
And stubbornly
refuse to admit that it was you.

744
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,030
No, Cheng, listen to me.

745
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
I wasn't too short to reach it that day.

746
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,270
I was carrying too many things in my hands.

747
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,350
That's why I was being .

748
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,200
stubborn.

749
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,110
I'm starting to hate you.

750
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,830
Do you think I care?

751
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,110
So feisty.

752
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,310
Hurry up.

753
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,550
Cheng, which one looks better?

754
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,640
The blue one.

755
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,880
I thought I just said blue.

756
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,310
Straight guys' aesthetics
are a reference of exclusion.

757
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
Like Chubby's.

758
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,160
What else do you want to buy?
Buy it all at once.

759
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,350
Don't act like an acrobat.

760
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,830
You were almost hanging on that shelf.

761
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,960
It's not my fault.

762
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,790
Only one last pair of pink.

763
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,350
I just managed to get it off.

764
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,440
- But you...
- You were the one

765
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,000
who put the water away

766
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,480
in the supermarket that day.

767
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,000
What are you talking about?

768
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,680
How did you know that?

769
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,440
You were the water thief.

770
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,310
What water thief?

771
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,350
Did it have your name on it?

772
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,550
I saw it first, so I hid it.

773
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,350
You call that 'hiding it'?

774
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,440
Why can't I?

775
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,790
Hiding things away in the supermarket,
are you a kid?

776
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,960
I was afraid someone else would take it.

777
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,310
Those two days,

778
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,680
I thought I was being besieged
by a pack of zombie shorties.

779
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,270
I didn't know it was all the same person.

780
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,160
What zombie shorty!?

781
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,440
Captain, watch what you say.

782
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,750
Are long legs a big deal? You walk so fast.

783
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,310
Beauty camera, what is it for?

784
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
It's for the live streaming.

785
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,960
Has Rui talked to you today

786
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,160
about the live streaming KPI?

787
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,350
You didn't bargain with him?

788
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Using the excuse that girls
need to sleep and wake up early

789
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,400
to make him give you
ten hours less on the air every month?

790
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,590
Forty-five hours and thirty-five hours.

791
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,480
What's the difference?

792
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,110
You'll know the difference

793
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,110
when you need to
catch up at the end of the month.

794
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,270
What do you mean?

795
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,030
It's like your kindergarten homework
for the summer.

796
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,960
And you saved it for the last day.

797
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,200
Who're you saying goes to kindergarten?

798
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,160
Can you talk nice?

799
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,510
A warning from senior.

800
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,590
Such a good deed,

801
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,110
I would only do once in my life.

802
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:06,340
(Welcome to the Win House, A section.)

803
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,360
It's him?

804
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,510
Is it Cheng? Cheng!

805
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,150
What are you rushing for?

806
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,840
Your fans are taking pictures.

807
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,510
What's wrong with taking pictures?

808
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,920
How can I meet people today
without much makeup on?

809
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,960
And I haven't posted a picture online yet.

810
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,030
You think your fans

811
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,710
would be kind enough
to use the beauty camera on me?

812
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,190
They're coming this way.

813
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,440
Cover me up. Don't expose me.

814
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,760
It'd work vertically, but horizontally?
Not sure.

815
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,510
Cheng, I'm so glad to see you here.

816
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,630
Can you sign for me, please?

817
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,440
Cheng, how's Ming's hand?

818
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,230
I read from the official that
his hand has been being treated.

819
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,880
Is it true?

820
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,320
Cheng, you are really tall.

821
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,070
Taller than you were
on the scene of the competition.

822
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,880
Crap!

823
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,030
Am I going to be exposed?

824
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,760
Cheng.

825
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,230
- Is this your girlfriend?
- She saw me.

826
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,360
- What should I do?
- No.

827
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,150
Why would I find a girlfriend
who looks like my daughter?

828
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,440
She's a team worker.

829
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,840
She accompanied me out shopping.

830
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,320
She is so cute.

831
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,150
Childlike is the correct word.

832
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,320
Miss, could you take a picture
for me and Cheng?

833
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,030
I want it, too. I want it, too.

834
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Thank you, Cheng.

835
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,510
It's my turn, take a picture for me please.

836
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,630
Thank you, Cheng.

837
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,320
Thank you, Cheng.

838
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,550
- Thank you, Miss.
- You're welcome.

839
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,840
Bye, Cheng. Bye.

840
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,320
Yeah, I didn't expect to see him in person.

841
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,880
Bye bye.

842
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,280
Let's go.

843
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,630
He's so cool.

844
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,630
What the hell is that
look on your face about?

845
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,400
Cheng.

846
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,110
Do you think I'll have
as many fans as you do in the future?

847
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,880
Will they like me so much that

848
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
they'd fight to take pictures with me?

849
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,280
That's if you can get to the finals.

850
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,760
If the team signed you

851
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
only to get its grade dropped,

852
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
there will be a lot more people than this

853
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,320
to blame you for it.

854
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,360
They'll ask you every day
if you choked to death on your water.

855
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,070
How come the wind outside
didn't blow you away.

856
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,320
They will fight to hang you on the wall.

857
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,760
Just like K did.

858
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
Do you care?

859
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,510
Shall I be honest?

860
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,190
Play well if you care.

861
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,960
In the world of e-sports,

862
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,630
only the strong can be recognized.

863
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,880
You've just came into the business.

864
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,320
There's going to be a lot of skepticism.

865
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,960
But if you can prove it by strength

866
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,070
that you can replace Ming.

867
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,670
No one will say a word more about you.

868
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,710
However, Cheng,

869
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,960
how come no one ever seems to question you?

870
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,840
Because I am strong.

871
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,280
In e-sports, weakness is the original sin.

872
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,440
Let's go.

873
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,820
(Exit)

874
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,620
(Exit for vehicles)

875
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,880
K, go to the middle lane.

876
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,880
This way, go this way.

877
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,360
The corner.

878
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,960
What are you doing?

879
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,230
You're back.

880
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,590
Cheng seems to be getting along

881
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,480
with his new teammate very well.

882
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,070
Very well?

883
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,920
It's like taking your kindergarten daughter
to the supermarket

884
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,320
to buy snacks for a spring outing.

885
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,150
Tong Yao.

886
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,400
This is where you're going to sit.

887
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,440
Isn't this where you sat before?

888
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,360
It's not appropriate.

889
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,760
It's okay.

890
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,510
The midsolo all sit in this position.

891
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,190
Look,

892
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,070
this is the latest e-sports chair
that I changed for you

893
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,630
according to Chubby's instructions.

894
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,590
It's all professional.

895
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,320
It can be adjusted at will according to

896
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,480
your personal habits.

897
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,510
Have a try.

898
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,070
I guarantee you won't feel tired
even after a day of playing.

899
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,510
Miss Tong, go get it!

900
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
What's the use of just shouting "go get it"?

901
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,590
The team's warm-up match
is coming up in a few days.

902
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Whether she can stay or not

903
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,150
depends on her first performance.

904
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
Tong Yao, don't be nervous.

905
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,070
Cheng is always

906
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,070
so strict.

907
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
What is this thing?

908
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,550
It's a pink decoration that suits a girl.

909
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,630
Take it off.

910
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
It affects my vision when it's around.

911
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,880
I'll blame you if my rank drops.

912
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,550
I chose it carefully.

913
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,510
Tong Yao likes it. I won't take it off.

914
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,030
You like it?

915
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,960
The lace does block the vision a bit.

916
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,760
Miss Tong.

917
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,480
Don't let the power bully you.
