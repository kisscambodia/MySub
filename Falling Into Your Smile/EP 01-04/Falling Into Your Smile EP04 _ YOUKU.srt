1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,040
We often say that

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,400
when you recall a game,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,910
you are actually
recalling your youthful years.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,390
I didn't tell you that before,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,510
because it has been a year since we broke up.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,670
It's such a long time for me.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,320
Of course,

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
these are just memories.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,000
After all,

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,710
who is still playing "Contra" today?

11
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,940
=Falling into Your Smile=

12
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,780
=Episode 04=

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,590
FNC.

14
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,280
I think you do not need further introduction.

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,840
It's our old rival.

16
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,560
Since they officially entered
the Chinese market last season,

17
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,840
we have played six games against them.

18
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,150
We won four and lost two.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
The reasons for losing two games…

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,150
Cheng,

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
do I need to repeat them myself?

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,280
No, you don't.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,070
I need you to take it seriously this year,

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
because they have a Korean aid

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,200
bought from the team
winning the world final last year,

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,710
that is, TAT,

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,590
the former boss of Cheng.

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,920
This guy is named Kun.
(Name: Li Hengshuo, another name: Kun)

29
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,480
I've watched

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,480
the nine games FNC
played as of Kun's participation.

31
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,350
They won six and lost three.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
Their winning rate is up to 70 percent.

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,190
Kun's dominance in the jungle

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
is slightly better than K.

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,120
He is also very good at identifying
the enemy's weaknesses

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,840
and creating advantages for his teammates.

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,870
FNC's tactic for this season

38
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,870
is very clear.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,150
Their junglers

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,500
will carry the whole team.

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,140
(Club data)

42
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,680
So when you are playing against them,

43
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,080
I hope each of you

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
can pay attention to

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,630
the resources in your own jungle.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
We have Cheng and Chubby in the bottom lane.

47
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,630
So don't worry too much.

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,400
Kun also will not focus on
their vulnerable lane.

49
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,960
The top and middle lanes
are Kun's main targets.

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,680
Therefore, our junglers must cooperate well
in the top and middle lanes.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,470
K.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Tong Yao.

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,000
We're about to play the game.

54
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,430
Is it useful to take notes now?

55
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,840
Tong Yao.

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,120
Besides Tamamo-no-Mae,

57
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,430
what other shikigamis
are you good at playing?

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,150
Besides Tamamo-no-Mae?

59
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,870
Can you play any other roles
besides Tamamo-no-Mae?

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,470
Well, we're doomed.

61
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,680
Once they ban her from playing Tamamo-no-Mae,

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,870
we will lose our midsolo.

63
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,870
Don't talk nonsense.

64
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm good at playing a lot of shikigamis.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,120
Menreiki, Susabi, Enenra…

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,000
I can play any role.

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,590
Good.

68
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,030
In the training game,

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,960
the enemy will definitely
ban your role of Tamamo-no-Mae.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,150
Just get mentally prepared.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,630
First, we can ban the enemy's junglers

72
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,190
from picking Yamakaze, Yoto Hime and Yasha.

73
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,360
I guess they will give the other two bans to

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,750
the shooter.

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,030
We must take Mannendake first.

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Do not let Kun get it.

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,680
If Hakuro is not banned,

78
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,190
the enemy would choose to

79
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,470
combine Hakuro with Ichimokuren
in the bottom lane.

80
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,750
Then Cheng can continue to pick Youko.

81
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Chubby can choose Kuro Douji or Umibozu.

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,190
There will not be many options left
for the enemy's junglers.

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
According to Kun's previous performance,

84
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,030
he would probably choose Ubume.

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
Their topsolo would pick

86
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,590
Ryomen or Shuten.

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,590
To make up for their loss in the jungle,

88
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,520
they are more likely to pick Shuten.

89
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,400
Tong Yao,

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
which shikigami will you choose?

91
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Ootengu.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,190
Okay, Ootengu.

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Great, Ming.

94
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,960
You have foreseen that.

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,590
Tong Yao,

96
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,280
this is the first training game

97
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,240
since you joined ZGDX.

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,190
You can never take it lightly.

99
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,150
Okay.

100
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,680
I will not be a disgrace to the team.

101
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,120
You're very confident.

102
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,000
We must win this game.

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,680
Come on, everybody.

104
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,430
Tong Yao.

105
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,430
Come on!

106
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on!

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll go and prepare
some food for everyone.

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
The script is done.

109
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,600
The rest is up to you.

110
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,300
(Ibaraki Douji, Mannendake, Ootengu, Youko,
Kuro Douji VS Shuten, Ubume, Hakuro, Ichimokuren)

111
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,340
(Start fight)

112
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Line up along the river.

113
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,270
Cat, watch out.

114
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,560
The enemy's junglers
would come to steal Kirin.

115
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,680
They have entered our jungle.

116
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,800
I'll go to fight their bottom Kirin.

117
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,560
Stop.

118
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
Go straight to your top Kirin.

119
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
They probably won't show up.

120
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Cat, get closer to the jungle just in case.

121
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,360
Okay.

122
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,560
Cheng,

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
how do you know they didn't come?

124
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,750
Ubume is weak in the early stage.

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,310
Besides,

126
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,190
the position he just took

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,310
was found by Cat obviously.

128
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,000
But he still chose to continue.

129
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,070
So I guess,

130
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,310
Kun should be waiting for K
at their bottom Kirin.

131
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,300
(Jungle controller!)

132
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
(Kun  Li Hengshuo
Jungle  Sweet of Team)

133
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,240
Why is this guy not here yet?

134
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,560
Tong Yao,

135
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,870
their jungler is here.

136
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,780
(Seal: Initiate)

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,310
Nice!

138
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,950
As they didn't add caster minions,

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,120
the jungler must be absent.

140
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Do not risk until the enemy comes in sight.

141
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,680
What if you get caught in their trap?

142
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm sure

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,240
their jungler is not so smart.

144
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,270
She is too fierce. I'm scared.

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,070
Don't be afraid.

146
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,560
It's not too late to kneel down.

147
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
You still have time to type in?

148
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,950
Maybe you can even browse the Weibo.

149
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,160
Okay, the bottom Kirin's time is up.

150
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,920
It's time to get refreshed.

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,630
Ignore it.

152
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,000
K, go to the top lane.

153
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
Wait for their topsolo with Cat.

154
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:16,920
Okay.

155
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,270
Chubby, let's go back to the base.

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,390
Let Kun think
there is no jungler in our bottom lane.

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,630
The enemy's supporter
and bottom laner have gone home.

158
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,040
Got it!

159
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,510
Kun is here.

160
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,680
Wait in the grass nearby.

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,510
After Cat stalks them here,

162
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,720
it will be a sure catch.

163
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,430
The enemy's midsolo is missing.

164
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,560
Be careful.

165
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,720
Middle and bottom laners, come to me.

166
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,480
Okay.

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,600
They took the bait.

168
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,160
Cat, K, kill their topsolo.

169
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,870
K, follow.

170
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,070
I'm coming.

171
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,260
(Defeat Assist)

172
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,310
Cat, stalk.

173
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,310
I'm coming.

174
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,560
Cat is stalking us.

175
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,120
No, it's a scam! Leave.

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,510
Come on.

177
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,460
(Seal: Double Assist)

178
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,660
(Unassailable Support Assist)

179
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,080
- Nice!
- Good! Bravo!

180
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,200
Cheng,

181
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,720
you can be a director.

182
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,390
We have a good script.

183
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,270
K, Chubby,

184
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,320
steal their Orochi with me.

185
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,240
Got it.

186
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm dead. Be careful, Cheng!

187
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,060
(Defeat Assist)

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,200
K, watch out!

189
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Leave! Hurry!

190
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm leaving.

191
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,200
I'll wait for you to come back.

192
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,910
Don't go, K.

193
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,790
I can fight.

194
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
Tong Yao is starting again.

195
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,580
(Defeat)

196
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,000
K, be careful. I'm coming.

197
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,440
- Nice!
- Nice!

198
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,840
We won!

199
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,360
What's wrong?

200
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,270
Wonderful! Bravo!

201
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,120
Tong Yao, you played Ootengu so well!

202
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,360
A newborn calf is not afraid of the tiger.

203
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,870
You even dare go down to
the snake pit just now.

204
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,630
But I did a good job too.

205
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,790
No one would fight in this way.

206
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,000
Tong Yao,

207
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,720
I never thought

208
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,120
you could play the shikigamis so well.

209
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,600
- Great!
- You're too impulsive.

210
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,150
I thought we could fight them.

211
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,240
To kill you guys,

212
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,670
they had nearly run out of their skills

213
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,000
and got weak then.

214
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
If we hadn't seized the chance,

215
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
our skills would have been wasted.

216
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,030
It's too risky!

217
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,550
You taught me that!

218
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,320
How dare you talk back?

219
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,080
Confidence is good.

220
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,870
It's fear that brings trouble.

221
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,240
Tong Yao did very well, right?

222
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,870
Right!

223
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,440
Just move forward and fight.

224
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,720
You are indulging her.

225
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
I ordered milk tea for you guys.

226
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,750
Treat yourselves!

227
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,840
Milk tea.

228
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600
Let's take a break.

229
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,080
Let's go.

230
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
Go. Tong Yao, let's go.

231
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
Go.

232
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,720
Let's go.

233
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,860
(Win)

234
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,870
Cheng,

235
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,000
aren't you going?

236
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,790
No.

237
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,360
FNC is also very powerful.

238
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,000
It's just a game.

239
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,840
We will win the next game soon.

240
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,260
(Dinner Live Broadcast Kun)

241
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,270
But,

242
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
the girl from ZGDX
did excellently as midsolo.

243
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,030
I really admire her operations.

244
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,750
I'm looking forward to meeting her
in the competition.

245
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,030
ZGDX's tactics surprised me today.

246
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,720
Stop watching it,
or you will be really cocky.

247
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,310
After graduating from primary school,

248
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,589
I've never heard any compliments from others.

249
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,720
Let me hear more.

250
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,640
She must be a pretty girl.

251
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,000
- Don't listen to his nonsense.
- Right?

252
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,829
You can receive compliments from me.

253
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,510
Good-looking girls

254
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,719
- …are all very dangerous.
- Go ahead.

255
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,550
I remember my mom said that to me.

256
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,270
- Although this team is very good.
- Go ahead.

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,110
But next time I won't fall for it!

258
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,000
What do you mean?

259
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,000
Captain,

260
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
I did a great job today.

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Don't you want to praise me?

262
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,550
Good job.

263
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,350
Will you give me any reward?

264
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,640
Don't I have any strengths

265
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,750
that deserve your…?

266
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Here is a small red flower for you,
a reward from your captain.

267
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,920
Keep going.

268
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,960
I will paint it on your forehead next time.

269
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,030
Lu Sicheng, you must have not
graduated from kindergarten yet.

270
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,000
Stupid Lu Sicheng.
This ugly flower cannot be wiped off.

271
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,030
You wanted a reward and I gave it to you.

272
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,350
But now you are trying to wipe it off.

273
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,790
Why are you so fussy?

274
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,270
By the way, little girls are not allowed
to speak dirty words.

275
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,750
You do not like the little red flower?

276
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
Next time I will paint a turtle for you.

277
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,790
Bah.

278
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,350
And I will paint it on your forehead.

279
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,310
Let me tell you something.

280
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,510
Today's training game was really amazing!

281
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,350
Tong Yao's operation is so wonderful!

282
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,270
She does deserve to be called
"Mulan in E-sports".

283
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,920
Chubby, talk something about Smiling.

284
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,000
My girl. Wonderful!

285
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,030
I also like this girl.

286
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,920
Suddenly I feel letting her have Cheng for a while
(Dinner Live Broadcast Chubby)

287
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,240
doesn't seem to matter.

288
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,640
The middle and bottom laners
should work well together.

289
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,720
What's going on with the midsolo,
Cheng and Yang?

290
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,030
My Smiling is great.

291
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,880
Can you explain

292
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,270
- Did I tell you…?
- …the "White Snake in E-sports"?

293
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,310
Explain it.

294
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
Jian Yang was my boyfriend
when I was a student.

295
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,480
Then we broke up.

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,640
Smiling appeared.

297
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,030
Can you see the words we typed in?

298
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,880
She is really at the base.

299
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Why did you break up?

300
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,270
Young people in love break up easily.

301
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,440
Isn't it normal?

302
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,590
There is no special reason.

303
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
Where is Jian Yang now?

304
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
He is at CK's training base

305
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,510
in Shenzhen, China,

306
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,790
- and also in my blacklist.
- Naive!

307
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,920
Is that you who carried the team

308
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
to victory today?

309
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,270
In today's training game against FNC,

310
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,270
we would have had a big advantage.

311
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,310
I even went back to the city
and added some blood

312
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,510
under the nose of the enemy's midsolo.

313
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,880
Chubby, Cheng and K

314
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,510
worked together
to push the tower in the top lane.

315
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,550
After that, Cheng had a bright idea and said,

316
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,440
"How about going to steal their Orochi?"

317
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,920
So they went to do

318
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,590
that kind of sneaky thing.

319
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,960
But it turned out that

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,830
they shouldn't have done
too many things like that.

321
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,680
After all, everything is visible
in the bright sunshine.

322
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
Five people came up all at once
from the opposite side,

323
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,640
surrounding and beating them.

324
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,310
The big snake is also attacking wildly.

325
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,680
It was hard for them to survive, right?

326
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,680
I didn't carry the team. Really.

327
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,030
But the enemy was so eager to kill them

328
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,880
that they nearly ran out of their skills.

329
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,960
So I just reaped
the rewards of their hard work in the end.

330
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Who stole the snake?

331
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,640
Dare you say it again?

332
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,920
Good. Team bully's anger!

333
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,440
Domineering Captain Cheng
fell in love with me.

334
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
What's going on with you two?

335
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,070
Focus on the live broadcasting!

336
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,200
Stop your public display of affection.

337
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,550
Why don't you behave decently?

338
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,070
Why should we do that?

339
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,680
We are just teammates, okay?

340
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,510
We did not go shopping hand in hand.

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,350
The only time Cheng and I

342
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
appeared on the street together

343
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,200
was when I first joined the team.

344
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,240
That day, as I didn't know the way,

345
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,400
Cheng accompanied me
to the supermarket to buy daily necessities.

346
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,830
We did not go shopping hand in hand.

347
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,270
And my taste is not so bad.

348
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,790
Yeah, his taste is not…

349
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,240
What are you talking about?

350
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,790
It's not what you think.

351
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,400
I just joined the team not long ago.

352
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
If we are together, you will soon know it.

353
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,510
Will we receive your wedding candies?

354
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,640
Yes, perhaps!

355
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
Shameless!

356
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,350
Hello, Base Explosion,

357
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,550
what the hell is "shameless"?

358
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,640
Room Administrator, time to work!

359
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,240
Ban this guy's speech quickly!
What are you waiting for?

360
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,920
He is waiting for your wedding candies.

361
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,030
Aren't you wearing headphones?

362
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,830
I didn't turn them on.

363
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,590
Then who are you acting for?

364
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,030
I just want to keep my ears warm.

365
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
Bravo. Smiling, come on!

366
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,750
Looking forward to your excellent
performance in the National League!

367
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,720
Let's go to dinner together!

368
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,680
We should celebrate our big victory
in tonight's training game!

369
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,400
Okay!

370
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,240
What will we eat?

371
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,880
I'm starving.

372
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,920
AZ Hot Pot.

373
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,960
Cheng, is it okay?

374
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,440
Okay. Go.

375
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
My treat!

376
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,350
Okay, it's your treat.

377
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,880
K, do you want to go with us?

378
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,440
Let's go.

379
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,110
I'm not going.

380
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,640
I can't eat spicy food recently.

381
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,790
Leave him alone.

382
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,640
He is just that kind of person.

383
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,030
Only games attract him.

384
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,200
My God, the beef is amazing.

385
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,830
Rui, help me get two more plates.

386
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,400
Come on, come on.

387
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,720
The beef is amazing,

388
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,640
so is the beef tongue.

389
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,790
I'll give you mine too.

390
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,440
How come you guys are eating so fast?

391
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
It's tender. Order two more plates.

392
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Take your time.

393
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,160
I'll get nothing if I take my time.

394
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,590
568 yuan for a plate of scallops?!

395
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,070
Were they gotten out of the sea of stars?

396
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,110
Stop. Save some for me.

397
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,200
Tong Yao, you're screwed.

398
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,110
White gourd.

399
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,920
White gourd must be cheaper.

400
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,880
78 yuan!

401
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,240
Are you kidding me?

402
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,350
This is a robbery!

403
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,350
Why should I volunteer to pay the bill?

404
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,590
Nice.

405
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,830
Tong Yao.

406
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,590
What are you waiting for?

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,750
Get cracking.

408
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm not hungry.

409
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Is it because it's too expensive?

410
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,030
I saw that Cheng

411
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,550
gave his credit card
to the manager just now.

412
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,400
He paid the bill.

413
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,000
Excuse me.

414
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Bring me two bowls of shark fin soup.

415
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,830
One is for drinking,
and the other is for rinsing my mouth.

416
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,510
Shorty.

417
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,480
Eat more meat,

418
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,240
so that you can grow taller.

419
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,590
Why is there no one here?

420
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,640
Take a careful look.

421
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,110
Look.

422
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,880
I think it's right here.

423
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,030
Let's go then.

424
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,400
Tong Yao.

425
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,310
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

426
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,310
You didn't want to come

427
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,960
when I invited you at first, right?

428
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,830
You still didn't say yes
after you arrived at the hotel.

429
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,550
How did you agree later somehow?

430
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,790
I was quite surprised.

431
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,680
To tell you the truth,

432
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,480
I thought Rui was a liar at first.

433
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,680
You thought?

434
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,070
He is a liar.

435
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,000
Me?

436
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,440
Have you ever seen such an honest liar?

437
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,350
Tong Yao, we have to make it clear.

438
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,750
Did I behave like a liar

439
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,480
when I was inviting you?

440
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,270
First you sent me messages in English,

441
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,510
and then in pinyin.

442
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,920
That was very strange.

443
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,510
And then I thought,

444
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,510
"Isn't there always a substitute

445
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,310
for Ming from ZGDX?

446
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,590
Where has he gone?

447
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,240
Why do they want me?"

448
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,480
Then I found you even more suspicious.

449
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,920
Besides, my parents didn't agree at first.

450
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,400
My mom and dad
didn't agree either at first.

451
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,880
My parents also didn't quite agree.

452
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,640
It's normal.

453
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,920
Every one of us,

454
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,590
except K

455
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,350
who has never mentioned his parents,

456
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,830
has parents who are clearly

457
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,110
against it.

458
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,310
So I hesitated at first.

459
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,000
So

460
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,830
what changed your mind?

461
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,790
That day, I went to see
the game between you and CK.

462
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,720
When I heard what Ming said on the stage,

463
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,350
I finally made up my mind:

464
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,640
"I want to be a professional player too.

465
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,240
I will stand on the world stage
with you guys

466
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,070
to win the world championship."

467
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,350
And then I can pat my chest,

468
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,200
telling those who
doubted about my ability that

469
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
"I, Tong Yao, made it."

470
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,640
I'm a little bit cocky.

471
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
Good for you.

472
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,400
Salute Tong Yao's dream.

473
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,070
Come on.

474
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,440
Let's make a toast together.

475
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,070
Okay.

476
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,720
Come on.

477
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Salute the dream.

478
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,830
Salute the dream.

479
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,400
Cheers.

480
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,720
Cheers.

481
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,920
Hello.

482
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,640
Anyone there?

483
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,880
Are they out?

484
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,920
Anyone there?

485
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,480
How can we enter uninvited?

486
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,310
The door is open, isn't it?

487
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,240
Change your shoes.

488
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,640
It's not necessary. Come on in.

489
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,200
Is anyone there?

490
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,270
Hello? Is anyone there?

491
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,310
Is anyone there?

492
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,510
Is anyone there?

493
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,000
Who are you, ma'am?

494
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,680
Hello?

495
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,510
Son.

496
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,960
Your mom is doing it again.

497
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,110
I will become a real coward
if I keep coaxing her.

498
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,270
What a henpecked husband. I'm sorry.

499
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
For what?

500
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,200
That's a Chinese traditional virtue,

501
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,350
isn't it?

502
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,550
Yeah, it is.

503
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,510
Chubby is right.

504
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,350
It's a virtue.

505
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,720
How can an upper-class gentleman

506
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,680
be henpecked?

507
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,200
Everything he does is out of love
for his wife and children.

508
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,070
When you have spouses in the future,

509
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,750
remember what you said today.

510
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,880
If you forget,

511
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,830
I can remind you.

512
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,960
You're not going back again, are you?

513
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:44,960
Don't care about that.

514
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,790
They will be fine in a couple of days.
Let's go.

515
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,510
Let's go.

516
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,880
What's Cheng's family background?

517
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
You don't know?

518
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,720
I just know he's rich.

519
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,310
There's more to it.

520
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,270
Have you heard of the Lu's Group?

521
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,790
He is exactly the eldest son
of the group president.

522
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,110
Their family has nothing but money.

523
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,550
According to the typical script,

524
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,640
shouldn't he inherit the company?

525
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Why do I have a feeling that his parents

526
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,000
both support his e-sports career?

527
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,480
I heard that they weren't on board either

528
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,480
at the beginning.

529
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,640
I don't know what happened.

530
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,000
Anyway, when I came here,

531
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,200
his family had already been
a shareholder of the team.

532
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,680
He bought the team?

533
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,440
What are you gossiping about?

534
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,440
Nothing.

535
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,830
Boss, I'm going to leave now.

536
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,310
Chubby.

537
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,790
We weren't gossiping.

538
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,030
We were just talking about

539
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,310
how your parents
supported your e-sports career.

540
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,070
Why are you so interested in that?

541
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,440
Don't your parents
support your e-sports career?

542
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,550
My dad's fine with it.

543
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,270
My mom is like…

544
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,030
If only my dad is the head of our family.

545
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,590
But my dad is just
as henpecked as your dad.

546
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,030
It's actually good.

547
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,240
That's good.

548
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,960
You can't expect your man to be henpecked.

549
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,830
Why?

550
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,160
One world, one dream.

551
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,000
Because you're suggestible.

552
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,550
Let's go, Shorty.

553
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,270
Wait for me.

554
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,400
You're long-legged, so what?

555
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,590
Lu Sicheng.

556
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,070
Why are you all standing here?

557
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,480
Dad.

558
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,830
Mom.

559
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,310
You...

560
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,550
You drank?

561
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,310
No, I didn't.

562
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,510
Mom.

563
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,030
Chrysanthemum tea.

564
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,480
It can clear away internal heat
and toxic materials and protect your liver.

565
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,400
Have a sip.

566
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,920
Knock it off.

567
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,680
Are we here to drink tea?

568
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,350
Yes, yes.

569
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:00,920
You…

570
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,110
No, no.

571
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,240
What the hell is wrong with you?

572
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,590
You're a girl.

573
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
Why did you drink alcohol?

574
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,030
Didn't you say

575
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,240
you came here to play
some kind of professional games?

576
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,200
You promised me when you left that

577
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,550
this was a proper job.

578
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,720
Look at yourself.

579
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,070
You're even hiccupping from wine.

580
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
The proper job you said

581
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,030
is to go out drinking at night?

582
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,510
Did they instigate you to do so?

583
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,200
Do you know who they are
and what their backgrounds are

584
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,110
before you just hang out
with them every day?

585
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,880
That Chessman?

586
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:34,830
Who's him?

587
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Mom.

588
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,790
It's no longer fashionable

589
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,750
to pry into someone's background.

590
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,400
Don't interrupt me.

591
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Let's get serious.

592
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
You've been here for only a few days.

593
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,880
And you've already

594
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,030
made such a mess.

595
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
Now rumor has it on the internet

596
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
that you and that Chessman

597
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,960
have put on a so-called

598
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,440
"White Snake" show.

599
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,550
Every time I call you,

600
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,880
I can't say a few words before you hang up.

601
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,070
How can your dad and I not be worried?

602
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,310
What's the difference between
these computers and ordinary ones?

603
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,920
There is a big difference.

604
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
For example, the monitor

605
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,160
is customized according

606
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,920
to personal habits and preferences.

607
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,070
Am I right, Tong?

608
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,590
And so is the computer case.

609
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,640
What's the difference?

610
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,030
It's water-cooled inside.

611
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,270
Tong.

612
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,550
Your mom is right.

613
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,070
What does water-cooling mean?

614
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,110
Water-cooling means heat dissipation.

615
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,160
Mom.

616
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm doing fine here.

617
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,480
What could happen to me?

618
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,920
So you didn't even read

619
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,960
the news I sent you?

620
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,200
Dad.

621
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,830
Your mom has a good point.

622
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,590
You have to listen to her.

623
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,440
Look, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

624
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,070
These are the comments on us
on the internet.

625
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,350
Sorry.

626
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,720
Sorry for all the trouble.

627
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,270
Never mind, Tong Yao.

628
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,550
Look, we're

629
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,070
taking good care of your parents.

630
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,260
(Boast for victory
Self-mockery for loss)

631
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,310
Well.

632
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,790
Don't look at that. You can ignore that.

633
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,270
Just look at this. Look at this.

634
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,270
Not bad. Good.

635
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,640
This is an accident.

636
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,640
Really.

637
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,270
I promise I'll send them away
as soon as possible.

638
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,960
Don't panic.

639
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,720
- Tong Yao.
- Mrs. Tong, look.

640
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,200
You didn't drink much tonight.

641
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,720
Why can't you stop burping?

642
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,400
Come on.

643
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,880
Have a slice of dried mango to relieve it.

644
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm burping not because of the wine.

645
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,200
- It's because I'm scared.
- This is about me.

646
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,030
- I'm scared.
- Of course, it's about you.

647
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,000
I understand.

648
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,640
It's normal for parents to pay a visit.

649
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,880
I think

650
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,240
we should help Tong Yao through this.

651
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,110
We can smile together

652
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,440
and extend our greetings to make
a good impression on her parents.

653
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,830
Mr. Tong, this way.

654
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,200
These are all our trophies.

655
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,160
Forget it.

656
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,070
Cheng, you can just keep your distance then.

657
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,640
Thank you.

658
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
- There are so many.
- How's that, Tong Yao?

659
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,880
See this?

660
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,720
- Thank you.
- It's about me.

661
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,590
If you can send them away
as soon as possible,

662
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,440
I'll buy you a month's supply of snacks.

663
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,230
This is the training base of ZGDX,

664
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,110
not an acting training class.

665
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
We don't have the time
to cooperate with you in your show.

666
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,800
If there's too much trouble,

667
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,840
why don't you ask your parents
to take you back?

668
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,710
K.

669
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,760
Yao.

670
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,280
What are you guys talking about?

671
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,440
What should we take back?

672
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,150
It's nothing, Mrs. Tong.

673
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,030
Mom.

674
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,960
It's getting late.

675
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,550
If you want to criticize me,

676
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,280
you'll have to wait until you
get up tomorrow morning, right?

677
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,920
Let's go.

678
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,710
Let's go to bed.

679
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,710
I'm not sleepy yet.

680
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
- You're leaving?
- Mom, you are sleepy.

681
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,840
Dad, come on.

682
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,590
Should I go too?

683
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,190
Come on, come on.

684
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,710
See you tomorrow, Mr. Tong.

685
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,280
Okay.

686
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,880
Let's go. Okay.

687
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,190
Mr. Tong, here's a bag of dried mango.

688
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,440
- It's for me?
- Yes.

689
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,230
It's for you.

690
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,920
I'll take it then.

691
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,550
Sorry for the trouble, bye-bye.

692
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,320
Okay, bye-bye.

693
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,590
Bye-bye. Bye.

694
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,920
Okay, bye-bye.

695
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,880
Tong Yao, take care of your parents.

696
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,960
I'll take care of them.

697
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,630
Yao.

698
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,550
If you're not happy here,

699
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,710
go home with us tomorrow.

700
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,800
Mom.

701
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,230
How can you tell I'm not happy?

702
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,800
You...

703
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,960
Tong.

704
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,510
I don't want to go.

705
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,280
Yao.

706
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,230
Mom.

707
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,230
Dad.

708
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,840
I know you're worried about me.

709
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,150
But I'm doing great here.

710
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,360
Really great.

711
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,670
Although I felt a little out of it at first,

712
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,920
I really

713
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,920
want to be a professional e-sports player.

714
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,550
So I have to overcome
all these difficulties.

715
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,630
I know you worry about me.

716
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,880
You want to arrange a regular job for me.

717
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,320
But I'm pretty sure

718
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,150
that's not the kind of job I want.

719
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,000
If you don't like the job at the bank,

720
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,400
we can find another one for you.

721
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,190
Mom.

722
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,880
I know you both want me to be better.

723
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,030
But

724
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,190
if I go to the place for an internship
as you arranged,

725
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,070
get a job I don't like,

726
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,230
marry a man I neither like

727
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,630
nor dislike,

728
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,150
and then have kids

729
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,110
and live a stable life until retirement,

730
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,880
my epitaph will read,

731
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,760
"Here lies an ordinary person
who lived a stable life

732
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,670
but were never happy."

733
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,320
Such a life is totally meaningless.

734
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,840
Dad, Mom.

735
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,110
I'm an adult now.

736
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,280
So I'm not kidding

737
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,150
or just trying.

738
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,550
I'm serious about learning

739
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,510
how to become

740
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,280
an excellent professional e-sports player.

741
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,800
Maybe one day,

742
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,960
your daughter

743
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,590
can stand on the stage of a world competition

744
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,960
and win a world championship.

745
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,800
You must be dreaming, champion.

746
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,920
Maybe.

747
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,510
Dad.

748
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,550
Say something.

749
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,920
Well.

750
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,440
Your mom is right.

751
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,550
You…

752
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,840
You have a point too.

753
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,360
What I just said is true.

754
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,000
The National League
is only three months away.

755
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,480
I hope

756
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,230
you can let me stay here until that time.

757
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,670
If I really can't get used to the life here,

758
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,800
or I really don't fit in here,

759
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,920
I will go home then.

760
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,320
Dad.

761
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,710
Let's just act the same way as before

762
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,000
to make a gentleman's agreement
and an equal treaty

763
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,110
between father and daughter.

764
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,840
How's that?

765
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,960
Fine.

766
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,480
Let's make a gentleman's agreement

767
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,630
and an equal treaty.

768
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,550
I knew my dad was
the most open-minded and sensible.

769
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,150
Thank you, Dad.

770
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,000
Of course.

771
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
My mom is more open-minded and sensible.

772
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,230
Enough. Don't show off your cleverness.

773
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,800
I'm telling you something serious.

774
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,230
You didn't point out to me

775
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,550
that Chessman
who was mentioned on the internet.

776
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,510
Does he have a crush on you?

777
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,630
His nickname is Chessman.

778
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,630
It doesn't sound like a good man.

779
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,280
You should be careful.

780
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,400
Mom.

781
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,030
How many times have I told you?

782
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,230
It's a misunderstanding.

783
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,070
You'd better spend less time
surfing the internet.

784
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,920
Misunderstanding?

785
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,150
What misunderstanding?

786
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,590
You've always

787
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,480
thought your mom doesn't know anything.

788
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,070
Right?

789
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,550
Let me tell you.

790
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,760
I'm a teacher.

791
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,760
I'm surrounded by young people.

792
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,070
Dad.

793
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,800
Your mom has a point.

794
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
Cheng.

795
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,840
Rui just cleaned out a room.

796
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,510
Let me lead your parents downstairs to sleep.

797
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,150
Thank you, Cheng.

798
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,800
By the way, Mom and Dad.

799
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,550
Let me introduce someone to you.

800
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,630
This is our team captain

801
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,320
Lu Sicheng. You can call him Cheng.

802
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,550
He's a nice guy.

803
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,030
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

804
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,190
We cleaned out a room in a hurry.

805
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,710
You'll have to make do with it tonight.

806
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,360
Thank you so much.

807
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,670
We came here uninvited.

808
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,320
Sorry for the trouble.

809
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,510
I'm sorry.

810
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,280
By the way,

811
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,510
I forgot to tell you something just now.

812
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,590
People also call me

813
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,590
Chessman.

814
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,590
Good.

815
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,920
Very good.

816
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,960
Chessman.

817
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,920
Let me take it, Mr. Tong.

818
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,630
Thank you.

819
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,550
It's okay.

820
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,360
Thank you.

821
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,960
Mr. and Mrs. Tong, this way, please.

822
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,440
Go.

823
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,190
Have an early rest.

824
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,030
Close the door.

825
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,920
Okay.

826
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
See you tomorrow morning.

827
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,510
See you tomorrow morning.

828
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,920
