1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,350
No one and nothing

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,480
can be invisible online.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,670
I was just curious about

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,160
why you didn't tell me
you were playing professional e-sport games?

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,040
Isn't it a better choice for you
to come to our team

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,270
than go to the ZGDX Team?

7
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,110
Bro.

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
It's my own decision to play as a pro.

9
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,240
It has nothing to do with you.

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,750
Block me.

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,870
Cheng.

12
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,870
Is she your girlfriend?

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,350
Especially when I've got you.

14
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,500
(Smiling?@ZGDX e-sport club)

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,160
(Seems like some big news.)

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,000
Smiling.

17
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,800
It must be her.

18
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,070
Although it's only her back,

19
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,600
she looks cute.

20
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,000
This girl knows Jian Yang?

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,030
How long has she been here?

22
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,520
She's already started to come
and go alone with Cheng.

23
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
Miss Smiling.

24
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,390
We can't wait

25
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,520
to see your first performance.

26
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,860
(Release)

=Episode 03=

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,150
Hey girl, wanna play a duo?

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
I'll have a look.

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,030
Outplayed.

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,240
Your hands move like lightning.

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,120
That's awesome.

34
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,560
Stop running,

35
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,150
wait for me.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,030
Fight with them, I am coming.

37
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,310
She dares to attack
when enemies are all there.

38
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,360
So much damage.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260
(Kill, support)

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,710
Tong Yao,

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,190
stop ambushing the enemy support,
I can't hold it.

42
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,030
A wave attack, hold there.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
I will be there in a minute.

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,470
No, there are three enemies there.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,590
It's fine, let's attack.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,470
Now press Q and jump them.

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,400
I…

48
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,680
Chubby, jump!

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
I…

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,520
Chubby is dead.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,910
Come on, noob.

52
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,460
(Kill, support)

53
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,310
Nice.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,870
Her hands are moving really fast.

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,870
Engage, Chubby.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,150
A wave, a wave, a wave.

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,150
You have more health, hold him.

58
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,870
Great, nice.

59
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,310
What a game.

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,280
Awesome!

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,120
Tong Yao, what you did was monstrous.

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,080
I feel like I was tricked.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,630
Are you sure we are playing a duo?

64
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,800
I feel like I am being left all alone.

65
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,750
Chubby.

66
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,000
You are the support,

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,400
and you gotta carry the damage.

68
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,750
Or else how am I going to carry the game?

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,710
Tong Yao,

70
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,190
I did not know that

71
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,000
you would become
a totally different person during the game.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,190
No wonder other people
call you the "Mulan in E-sports".

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,000
Tong Yao, you got the MVP.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,960
Awesome!

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,470
Easy, let me carry you for the next round.

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,190
Great!

77
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,360
K,

78
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,960
the new midsolo girl

79
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,030
is so awesome.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,190
One girl took the stats and kills
for the whole team,

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,310
great,

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
great solo,

83
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,120
why bother carrying the others?

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,830
Never mind, never mind.

85
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,120
Good game,

86
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,830
seriously.

87
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,750
Let's go, let's play.

88
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,390
All right.

89
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,390
I'll be the shooter.

90
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,950
Then I am out, I am out.

91
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,270
I know you are going to
bring up the old times.

92
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,120
K might be wrong in dealing with her.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,830
But he's got a point.

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,070
I understand.

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
She's been too aggressive
in terms of her playing.

96
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,270
Lack of teamwork.

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
No professionalism.

98
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,430
I know,

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,950
(Seal · Three Holy Artifacts)
you told me

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,240
before the tryout match.

101
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,740

(Invincible Victor)

103

(Seal · Matrix of Five Phases)

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Are you all right?

105
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,310
I told you to let me play it for you.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,630
Why not?

107
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,950
It's ok.

108
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,240
What do you think?

109
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,920
Too aggressive.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,040
Lack of team spirit.

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,190
No professionalism.

112
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,920
Professionalism can be cultivated.

113
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,270
She's the best

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
among all of the candidates.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,070
Why are we hiring a newbie?

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,750
We have been through that conversation.

117
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,270
You are our midsolo.

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,310
You have the say about

119
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,360
who's going to be in your place.

120
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,310
You never asked me

121
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,800
why I chose Tong Yao.

122
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,750
Half of our team

123
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,160
was chosen by you.

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Not to mention,

125
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,360
she's taking your place as a midsolo.

126
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,560
I have faith in your judgment.

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,630
She is the one I

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,750
hand-picked from hundreds of candidates.

129
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,800
She has a strong desire to win

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
and doesn't give up easily.

131
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,430
She's fearless.

132
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,480
Kind of like you.

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,480
I can't play the game
with my hand the way it is now.

134
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,830
But the reason I choose
to retire at this moment

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,750
is not entirely because of my injured hand.

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,270
There have been many new talents
for this year's Spring Playoffs.

137
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,270
If we want make it to the Finals.

138
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,390
We need fresh blood like Tong Yao.

139
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,800
You are brilliant, Tong Yao.

140
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Nice, good one.

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
That's risky.

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,920
The National League is about to begin.

143
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,120
That's why I need you
to train Tong Yao with me.

144
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,190
You are right.

145
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
She has to learn
how to become a professional player

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
instead of just a gamer.

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Come up with a training program
for her as soon as possible.

148
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,480
Starting from tomorrow.

149
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,870
Okay.

150
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,950
Hi dad.

151
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,720
Son.

152
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,480
Do you know how far your mum went?

153
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,240
I just said something a bit annoying

154
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,750
and she just walked out again.

155
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, I got it.

156
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,190
I'll be home tomorrow.

157
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,040
No, son.

158
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,270
You gotta help me figure it out.

159
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
How to talk to your mum.

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,750
I.

161
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,270
It's okay, just go home.

162
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,630
Don't worry,

163
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,870
I will start to train her beginning tomorrow.

164
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,630
(Tactics, War Gods Directory, Basics for Middle Laners)
Tong Yao, let's begin our training.

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
Today I am going to start from

166
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,360
being a professional e-sport player.

167
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
The ultimate goal of participating in a game

168
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,950
is not to achieve individual victory,

169
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,720
but a team one.

170
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,950
During the process.

171
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,070
You need to get rid of lots of

172
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,630
your attitudes of charging ahead alone.

173
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,830
And the first thing you need to get used to

174
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,830
is to see yourself
as a screw within your team.

175
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,870
Okay.

176
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,920
I am ready to be a backup.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
We will officially begin when you are ready.

178
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,950
First take a look at this.

179
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,820
(Basics for
Decisive Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

180
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,380
(ARM Practice)
APM practice, last hit practice.

181
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,430
(Creep Score)
APM practice, last hit practice.

182
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,310
Get to know the game's background
and shikigami characteristics.

183
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,270
These are the very basics.

184
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,830
Are you sure you've got the right one?

185
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,430
For a professional player,

186
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,560
you are still a newbie.

187
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,190
You need to understand that

188
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,070
playing e-sports and playing video games
are two different things.

189
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
That's why you need some good training.

190
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,240
Let's roll.

196
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,630
Keep on with the last hit.

197
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,150
♪The reversal of plots

198
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,910

215

Another round.

216
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,340
(Aoandou)

217
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,630
So tired.

218
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,550
As tired as a dog.

219
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,020
(Jin Yang)

220
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,270
Hi.

221
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,510
Hi, Yao.

222
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,840
You are up so early.

223
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,600
No, not up.

224
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,910
I haven't gotten any sleep.

225
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,870
I am exhausted.

226
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,390
I just sent you a picture.

227
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,750
Check out your WeChat.

228
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,020
(Mother of Amao)

229
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,630
That's why Ai Jia's been saying

230
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,510
he couldn't find you anywhere.

231
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,270
Turns out you are enjoying your own retreat.

232
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,030
What happened to the promise of
favoring your besties?

233
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,510
My advice, be a human, please.

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,360
Well, I am on my break-up trip, aren't I?

235
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,550
Hawaii is so great.

236
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,790
Next time I will bring you along.

237
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,150
I can't.

238
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
You don't care.

239
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
Will you feel good
hearing me crying out loud for you?

240
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,360
What's up?

241
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,440
Why can't you make it?

242
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,790
It's so hard to become
a professional e-sport player.

243
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
I got trained like a dog.

244
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,240
12 hours a day every day.

245
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,360
And it's all about the basics.

246
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,840
My hands are wasted.

247
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,390
I doubt they are doing this on purpose.

248
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,320
Crap.

249
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,790
What?

250
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,790
I feel like I am talking to Ai Jia.

251
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Goodbye.

252
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,150
Who is it?

253
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
Tong Yao, are you awake?

254
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,360
Time to eat dinner.

255
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,670
I just went to bed, no dinner for me.

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,270
It's getting dark.

257
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,480
Ming called you to have a duo with K.

258
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,320
Do you want to?

259
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
K?

260
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. K.

261
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,080
Coming.

262
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,750
On my way, soon.

263
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,480
Ming arranged this.

264
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,030
I am ready.

265
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,700
(Onmyoji Dayun,
Qualification Game, Mist, Unselectable)

266
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,620
(Multiple Individuals Team matching,
Onmyoji Dayun)

267
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,480
Holy!

268
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,150
What's up?

269
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,240
Who did you get?

270
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
This Sunflower.

271
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,270
Why does it sound so familiar?

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,670
Yao, what a coincidence.

273
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,550
Make it a good one.

274
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,360
I will cover you.

275
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,080
Yang.

276
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,740
(So tired, as tired as a dog)

277
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,630
As tired as a dog.

278
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
No way.

279
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,270
What?

280
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,320
I am against Cheng.

281
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,150
Why do I keep hitting the jackpot
without buying any lottery tickets today?

282
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,840
First Cheng and then Jian Yang.

283
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,120
What role is Cheng?

284
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,360
The enemy is doing Jungle.

285
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,270
Then we're finished.

286
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,910
He's going to stay in your middle lane.

287
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,440
What am I going to do?

288
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,870
I was one round away
from claiming the Lord of Kyoto.

289
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,120
Why would I meet Cheng?

290
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,870
On my.

291
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,120
And also Jian Yang.

292
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,840
Calm down.

293
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,150
The Shikigami Cheng chose

294
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
is a mid-level Shikigami.

295
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,840
As long as we make sure
Yang is in the middle lane,

296
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,270
we can still have a chance to win.

297
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,440
Don't panic.

298
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,600
Let me teach you a move.

299
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,240
Later.

300
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,150
Are you done?

301
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,150
Or just AFK?

302
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,510
Listen to my advice.

303
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,200
Cheng is definitely going to throw the game.

304
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,320
Is now the time?

305
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, take my word for it.

306
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,910
Cheng.

307
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,750
I am one round away
from claiming the Lord of Kyoto.

308
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,600
So,

309
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,720
please don't screw me.

310
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,670
You have my respect.

311
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,440
It seems to be working.

312
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,270
The minions are now under the turret
and Cheng is yet to be found.

313
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,480
Of course.

314
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,260
(Seal · Initial Ritual)

315
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,700
(Kill, Support)

316
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,399
Go back to the base, I will protect you.

317
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,660
(Lightning Speed)

318
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,350
What's going on?

319
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,510
Well.

320
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,310
Cheng.

321
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,350
Are you taking me with you while dying,

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,070
and being buried together?

323
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,400
How kind you are, Cheng.

324
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,480
Tong Yao, Tong Yao.

325
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,350
Psychological attack.

326
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,160
Are you sure?

327
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Just do what I told you.

328
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,240
Hurry.

329
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,960
When are you coming back, Cheng?

330
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,720
The cat,

331
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Biscuit,

332
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,440
is trying to catch fish.

333
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,070
I can't help with that.

334
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Hurry back and deal with it.

335
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,070
You are losing your sons.

336
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,270
It's my fault, Cheng.

337
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,920
It was all Chubby's idea.

338
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,680
Your sons are all good.

339
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,400
It's a big family
with many sons and grandsons.

340
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,510
I am also very obedient.

341
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,680
Cheng, we miss you a lot.

342
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,790
When are you coming back?

343
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,550
As we are missing you so much.

344
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
Don't come to middle lane.

345
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,510
Enjoy the view on the bottom lane.

346
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,400
What the hell?

347
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,590
Nobody cares.

348
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,350
What's so funny about that?

349
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,680
Does it make any sense, talking to yourself?

350
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,590
If you want to win, I will carry you.

351
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,640
Tong Yao, is that what you want?

352
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,240
Hello.

353
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,160
I told you to stop calling, didn't I?

354
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,200
K.

355
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,790
Don't worry, Tong Yao.

356
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,750
I guess it's K's family calling.

357
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,110
He becomes like that

358
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,070
as soon as he picks up
his family's phone calls.

359
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
Not against you.

361
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,830
Why did you stop playing?

362
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,640
I will be back tomorrow.

363
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
Watch yourself and the cat.

364
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,400
Bye.

365
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,000
Who is it? What's up?

366
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,270
Cheng.

367
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
Cheng, what did he say?

368
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,640
He says he will return tomorrow.

369

(ZGDX: first show of its midsolo, a show of

(Smiling: You are gonna lose your sons!)

374
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,940
(Smiling: Go back to the base,
I will protect you)

375
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,140
(Sunflower: If you want to win,
I will carry you......)

376
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,030
Check out the e-sports industry farm.

377
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,590
ZGDX double play flirting interaction.

378
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,440
Yang from CK is shown a cold shoulder.

379
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,200
It could be called
The e-sport Legend of the White Snake.

380
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,270
How long has this girl been here for?

381
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,880
Flirting with Cheng?

382
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,830
What a shame.

383
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,270
Reply to the post and curse her.

384
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,070
No way.

385
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,680
What is Cheng doing?

386
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,110
And what's wrong with Yang?

387
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,510
What a dramatic love triangle.

388
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,000
According to reliable sources,

389
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,400
She is Yang's first love.

390
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,830
Is Yang Xiao Qing?

391
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,110
Have you seen a Xu Xian
like Lu Sicheng before, poster?

392
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,270
I can't believe Yang is that kind of person.

393
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Yang seemed to be jealous.

394
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,310
I wouldn't have thought him
as someone who would say those words.

395
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,110
Like "come on, I can carry you".

396
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,830
It's so flattering, ok?

397
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,640
That's why generally,

398
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,790
a professional team
doesn't have female players.

399
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,510
It's too easy to develop office romance.

400
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,720
It's not like I am against it.

401
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,000
Everything seems to be fine
when they are together.

402
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,240
But what if they have a quarrel?

403
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,880
How are they still going to
fight alongside one another?

404
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
What are these?

405
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,110
Are they talking about Yao?

406
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,110
Is she not off playing games?

407
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,550
How is she involved in a relationship?

408
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,310
Who are these people?

409
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,350
Why are they so mean?

410
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,460
(Oh my god, Yang seemed to be so jealous)

411
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,780
(Is she heading for the apex of her life?)

412
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,790
No.

413
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,720
Hello?

414
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,480
Hi mum.

415
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,310
Yao.

416
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,160
Would you explain to us

417
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,550
what's going on?

418
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,550
Why is there the Legend of the White Snake?

419
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Are you there to play games
or to date with someone?

420
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,480
Mum.

421
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,240
I have told you millions of times.

422
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,550
What more can I say?

423
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,480
There's literally nothing going on.

424
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,480
I have just been here a few days.

425
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,200
How could I be seeing anyone?

426
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,550
Besides, we have a 12-hour daily training.

427
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,550
I need some time and space
to be able to see someone, right?

428
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,790
Then.

429
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,110
The e-sports industry farm.

430
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,160
What are they talking about?

431
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,000
Why are you browsing information
on the so-called e-sports industry farm?

432
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,590
How am I supposed to know
what people said there?

433
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,000
I was also wondering
why would they say things like that?

434
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,200
Let me ask you.

435
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,200
Is this the Yang Jian Yang,

436
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,480
who broke up with you last year

437
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,110
and used to live next door?

438
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

439
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,030
Yang is Jian Yang.

440
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,440
That's right, the one who lives next door.

441
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,510
My relationship with him

442
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,200
didn't end up impeding my college life.

443
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,680
Why are you bringing that up?

444
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,510
We simply came across each other yesterday
during the game.

445
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,440
Before that, we have never seen each other.

446
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,680
Then who is Cheng?

447
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,750
He is flirting with you.

448
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,790
Cheng is our captain.

449
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,030
He is the most innocent.

450
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,310
Don't make things up.

451
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,200
What flirting?

452
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,550
Do I look like I have got the charm?

453
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,590
No.

454
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,640
I will tell you what.

455
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,110
You are a young lady.

456
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,110
Playing e-sport with a bunch of boys.

457
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,240
You gotta be extra careful, do you know that?

458
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,350
Don't fool around,

459
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,640
and leave the netizens to gossip around.

460
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,750
That would leave you a bad impression.

461
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,350
Mum, I got it.

462
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,350
I gotta go.

463
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,640
Yao.

464
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,310
Cheng.

465
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,240
What?

466
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,440
Why are you back so early?

467
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,400
Shorty.

468
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,880
What's going on between you
and this Jian Yang from the CK team?

469
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,510
What is it?

470
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,310
Our encounter in
the qualifying game last night

471
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,200
was posted by someone
on the e-sports industry farm.

472
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,110
With snapshots of all our conversations.

473
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,440
Don't tell me you didn't see it.

474
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,030
I saw it.

475
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,920
Why are you looking at the farm as well?

476
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,550
There are more than a thousand replies.

477
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,400
The mysterious relationship
between the three of us

478
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,720
is good enough for a TV series.

479
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,750
Its content,

480
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,310
A flattering heroine,

481
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,920
A desperate secondary lead actor.

482
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,350
And a cruel lead actor.

483
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
Come on, let's talk.

484
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,500
(Did some fan see Yang talking with
another girl on the day of the Spring Final)

485
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,660
(Is she this Smiling?
Maybe they already knew each other)

486
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,960
Of course, I knew her.

487
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,480
I have known that girl many years ago.

488
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,750
Yang.

489
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,550
Stop being unhappy.

490
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,030
How about some yogurt?

491
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,830
Piss off.

492
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,550
Oh, shoot.

493
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,790
Even Yang began to curse.

494
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,030
It's over.

495
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,550
Something's going to happen.

496
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,400
What do we do?

497
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,350
Go, go.

498
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,110
Me?

499
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,640
Yeah, go.

500
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,920
Me.

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
Yang.

502
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,790
Let's talk about this Smiling.

503
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Who is she?

504
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,070
Do you really want to know?

505
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,550
She's my ex.

506
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,830
She is playing professional games

507
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,510
only because of me.

508
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,720
Come on, come on, here, here, here.

509
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,750
All middle, all middle.

510
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,680
Come to the middle.

511
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,200
No, no, no.

512
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,350
Go, go, go.

513
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hit, hit, hit.

514
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,480
Go, go, go.

515
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,000
Go, go, hit it.

516
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,160
You'll die if you don't hit it.

517
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,440
No, I can't, I'm leaving.

518
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,680
Leaving, leaving, leaving.

519
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,310
Go, go.

520
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,750
I am sorry, that was my girlfriend.

521
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,000
I am sorry, so sorry.

522
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,750
Jian Yang.

523
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,200
Seeing as you are having so much fun.

524
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,110
How about you teaching me how to play?

525
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,200
And I can join you.

526
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,640
Sounds good, come on.

527
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,680
Take a seat.

528
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Which one do I pick?

529
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,350
Can I choose the good-looking one?

530
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,510
Stop scrolling, pick this.

531
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,790
White hair with long strands
of hair on the temples.

532
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,640
That's him.

533
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,750
This one looks so ugly.

534
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,070
A long as you are good-looking.

535
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,160
Are there any characters that
don't have to run around,

536
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,440
but are able to perform explosive moves,

537
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,310
good-looking,

538
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
and have a strong presence,

539
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,160
with no need to partner
with others when laning

540
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,680
in order not to get scolded
because of lame skills at the same time?

541
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,350
Yeah, midsolo.

542
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,110
Choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

543
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,920
You gotta control a lane
or you won't gain experience.

544
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,830
Don't use skills.

545
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,030
Give the minions the last hit.

546
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,550
How?

547
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,350
What's Acing the minions?

548
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,240
You land the basic killing blow

549
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,830
on an enemy minion
whose health is low enough.

550
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,310
I can't do the Acing.

551
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,680
Did you lie to me?

552
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,160
Help, help!

553
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,880
I am dead again.

554
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
How come I am dead again?

555
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,270
If you don't come to
the middle lane, Jian Yang.

556
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,270
You are losing your girlfriend.

557
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,510
Coming in hot.

558
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,310
I will kill whoever touches you.

(Victory)

560
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,510
Sweet.

561
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,310
What about after that?

562
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,310
After that.

563
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
I really did lose my girlfriend.

564
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,240
Jian Yang.

565
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,510
Happy Birthday!

566
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Thanks.

567
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,720
Open it and have a look.

568
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,880
How is it, do you like it?

569
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,070
Yeah.

570
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,160
As long as it's from you.

571
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,680
Let's go, let me help you put it on.

572
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,310
Just to see if they look good.

573
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,920
Come on, put it on.

574
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,830
Are you going out?

575
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,270
School is about to begin.

576
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,440
Have you finished your paper?

577
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,790
Stop procrastinating

578
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,110
and ask me to write it for you.

579
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
What's wrong?

580
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
I am not going back to school.

581
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,480
What?

582
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,510
A manager from a professional team
has spotted me.

583
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
He asked me to have a tryout in Shenzhen.

584
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,000
If everything goes well.

585
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,880
I will be staying there to play the game.

586
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,000
My parents have agreed.

587
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,640
You know I am not good at studying.

588
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,550
I don't know what to do after graduation.

Look.

665
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,110
You first trained her to be
the No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae on the Chinese server.

666
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,230
And then broke up with her.

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,510
Raised the level of hatred to a new height.

668
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,360
And then let her join the enemy's team.

669
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,190
That is going to
make her your biggest weak point.

I've told you everything.

714
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
The reason why
I didn't tell everyone anything

715
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,440
is because we broke up more than a year ago.

716
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,190
It has long been over.

717
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,150
I didn't expect this would cause
so much trouble.

718
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,800
Let alone affect you.

719
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,030
I didn't criticize you.

720
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

721
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,920
It's just I think.

722
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,400
I have just joined the team not so long ago.

723
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,150
And I haven't made any achievements.

724
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,960

right from the get-go.

725
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,710
Besides, I was playing duo with K yesterday.

726
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,630

727
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,190
mend the relationship between he and I.

728
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,110
But what I did yesterday

729
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,000
seemed to have upset him.

730
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,110
No.

731
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,960
But I heard from Chubby.

732
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,190
You have never had
any unfavorable news like this.

733
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,710
And this is your first time getting up
on the wall because of this.

734
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,320
I feel really sorry.

735
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,960
As a girl to be a professional player,

736
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,360
where you will be surrounded by boys,

737
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,360
it will be inevitable
to attract some attention.

738
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,000
I thought you already expected it.

739
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,400
I did.

740
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,110
But not this bad.

741
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,630
Wait until the surge of interest has gone.

742
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,590
What is left

743
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,150
will be your achievements and strengths.

744
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,230
The closest one is probably

745
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,960
the National League.

746
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,230
But the premise

747
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,920
is that you are qualified to be part of it.

748
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
I swear, Cheng.

749
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,550
I can definitely make it.

750
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,320
Rest assured, Cheng.

751
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,840
I will keep a close watch of Biscuit,

752
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,190
and make sure you have lots of kittens.

753
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,440
What's the matter, Cheng?

754
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,880
Why are your eyes reddening?

755
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,070
Nothing, I am allergic to cat's hair.

756
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,740
(ZGDX's midsolo girl seems
in love with captain, CK Yang gets involved)

757
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,550
Is the gossip about my "husband" true?

758
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,070
I am so sad.

759
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,070
I am mentally unstable now.

760
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,230
I will cancel the subscription.

761
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Turn into a troll from a fan.

762
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,190
You've got questions from your fans again?

763
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,550
Don't you have a phone?

764
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,630
Actually, you don't have to care
too much about what they say.

765
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,590
Lots of their words don't make sense.

766
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,960
It's not like they don't love you

767
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,230
once you are in a relationship.

768
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,800
In the fans' world,

769
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,670
It is pretty normal for them

770
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,070
to switch between a fan and a troll.

771
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,000
I couldn't believe it when someone told me

772
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,510
that they saw you with Cheng

773
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,670
shopping, hand in hand.

774
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,760
It's so annoying.

775
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,710
This is it?

776
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,630
That night,

777
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,590
I lost both my "husband"

778
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,840
and my "wife".

779
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,960
This strange news really did finally appear.

780
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,150
I am kind of worried about you.

781
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,880
As the only female professional player.

782
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,110
Don't fall at the very beginning.

783
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,840
Tong Yao!

784
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,630
What?

785
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,480
Look.

786
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,440
Here it says me and you, hand in hand.

787
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,230
They literally didn't spend a penny on lying.

788
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,150
I have never touched your hands at all.

789
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Now that I touched your hands,
do you still feel it's unfair?

790
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,920
Your cat is about to be suffocated.

791
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,070
Tong Yao.

792
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,030
We used to have a long-distance relationship,

793
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,400
plus the inappropriate timing.

794
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,030
Which makes you feel that our relationship
was a waste of your time,

795
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,590
that's why you found something unimportant

796
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,070
to have a fight with me over
and then broke up with me after that.

797
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,230
Now that you are
a professional player yourself.

798
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,360
You are also fully aware of
the daily routine of a pro.

799
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,510
I didn't mean to leave you alone.

800
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,510
I didn't want to break up with you at all.

801
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,760
The KTV incident is in the past.

802
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,230
And I shouldn't have lied to you.

803
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,590
It was my fault.

804
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,590
But I did apologize to you.

805
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,000
Yao.

806
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,400
Can we have a good conversation?

807
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,760
What are you doing?

808
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,880
Are you creating a shadow ID

809
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,480
and arguing with others on Tieba?

810
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,320
Do I look like such a bored person to you?

811
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,320
Yeah.

812
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,630
That's how I see you.

813
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,510
Childish?

814
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,360
In my view.

815
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,840
It is necessary to clarify this on Weibo.

816
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,030
About what?

817
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,480
Me, you and Jian Yang.

818
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,110
There is no White Snake Legend between us.

819
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:43,880
No need for that.

820
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes, there is.

821
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,190
I can't just stain your reputation.

822
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,960
Go check the special group on Douban.

823
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,590
(I am your father)
Nonsense, nothing like that.

824
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,880
Stop guessing.

825
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,670
Is that you?

826
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,760
Why?

827
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,630
The worst job

828
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,280
should be done by the man.

829
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,230
Cheng.

830
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,710
Why, why this look?

831
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,670
Take it back.

832
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,630
Although I have no idea

833
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,630
who will be lucky enough to be your Mrs. Lu.

834
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,230
But right now,

835
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,920
I am starting to envy her.

836
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,230
Because you will definitely
take good care of her.

837
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,550
No one can touch her
and nothing will harm her.

838
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,630
What Mrs. Lu?

839
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,800
Are you retarded?

840
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,510
We have an open training match appointment
with FNC tomorrow.

841
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,920
It will be recorded and shown to the fans.

842
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,440
Make it a good match, don't lose face.

843
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,510
Biscuit.

844
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,800
Jian Yang,

845
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,440
What's past is past.

846
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,710
No more mentioning.

847
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,110
You and Lu Sicheng.

848
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,740
(Ai Jia)

849
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,800
Hey Bro.

850
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,590
Hi Ai Jia.

851
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,030
I have something important to ask you.

852
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,510
Are you going to ask things
about Tong Yao and Lu Sicheng?

853
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,510
Don't worry,
nothing is happening between them.

854
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,070
It's all gossip on the internet.

855
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,320
Leave it.

856
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,710
I will keep playing the game then, bye.
