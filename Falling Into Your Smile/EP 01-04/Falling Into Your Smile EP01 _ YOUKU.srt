78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
Didn't you say just a while back

79
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,310
that you guys will think seriously
about the future?

80
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,000
Why did you break up?

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
Out of my league.

82
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,360
No more talking.

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,160
I want to go shopping.

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,270
Go with me. Let's go.

85
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm really done with him.

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,750
All he does is play games all day,

87
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,560
is a game more important than girlfriend?

88
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,040
I have been back to China
for a few months now,

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,870
and I finally caught a time
when he had no training.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,310
I told him I was in a bad mood.

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
Guess what he said?

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,190
I lost the training. I'm also in a bad mood.

93
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,240
Boo hoo.

94
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,720
I said I want to see him

95
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,040
He said, okay, honey.

96
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,750
I'll turn on the camera
when I live stream tonight,

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
come and see me,

98
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,240
and send me some gifts while you're at it.

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,070
Mwah.

100
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,240
I said I'm really tired from class.

101
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm also tired from playing games.

102
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,480
Tong Yao.

103
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,830
What? You asked me to guess.

104
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,480
I really can't bear you people

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,310
who are obsessed with games,

106
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,070
even your dates are about gaming.

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
And not just playing games,

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,310
he even despised my skills.

109
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,240
Please.

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Isn't it good for woman to be cute?

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
If there's a creature

112
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,390
that's cute

113
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,070
and can play games well,

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,190
then what's the point of
having e-sports youth like you guys?

115
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,560
I told you not to say yes

116
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,870
to that professional e-sports boy.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
As the saying goes,

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,310
There's no such thing
as falling in love in e-sports.

119
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,750
There's no such thing
as falling in love in e-sports.

120
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,950
Isn't your ex-boyfriend, Jian Yang,

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
also a professional e-sports player?

122
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
That's because I was young and frivolous.

123
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,160
That's the past.

124
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,430
Don't mention it.

125
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,800
Anyway, I'm serious this time.

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,870
I've spent three years
to complete my master's

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,390
abroad and came back.

128
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,310
Ai Jia still looks like a teenager
with internet addiction.

129
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,310
If only I knew earlier,

130
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,120
I might as well stay abroad
and not come back.

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,070
Tong Yao.

132
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,510

You're on your phone all the time!

136
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,310
Oh my god.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,360
Someone's asking me
to play e-sports professionally.

138
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,160
That's really damned.

139
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,430
That has to be a liar, right?

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
But why would he lie to me about this?

141
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
Who knows?

142
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,270
This liar keeps up with the times.

143
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,630
The business has developed
into the e-sports industry.

144

If this is not good enough, we can talk.

154
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,360
Then ask him, which team is it?

155
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,150
Okay.

159
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,840
ZGDX? What?

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,150
ZGDX of Lu Sicheng!

161
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,270
You mean, Lu Sicheng from the team
next to Ai Jia's,

162
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,320
the guy who's so hot that I can blush

163
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,150
even if I see him throwing garbage
in his pajamas?

It doesn't matter if

167
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,240
I've seen Lu Sicheng in pajamas.

168
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,840
The point is,
why doesn't the liar type Chinese?

169
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,840
May be his phone broke
and he can't type Chinese.

while I was playing a game today.

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,000
He asked me to play professional e-sports.

182
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a very famous team.

183
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,390
I also received a call today

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
said that I won a Rolls Royce

185
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,840
by buying fish in the supermarket.

186
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,360
(The 2020 Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

187
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
(Spring Final)

188
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,630
(will launch in Shanghai in recent days.)

189
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,000
(Live Onmyoji Arena Pro League)
(The two teams participating in the duel)

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
(are ZGDX and CK.)

191
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,910
(This grand game is expected)

192
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,480
(to attract thousands of people.)

193
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,440
Actually, being a professional player

194
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,480
and winning the championship on stage

195
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,080
seems to be a pretty cool thing.

196
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,750
I don't think cool is a factor to consider

197
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,960
when choosing a career.

198
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,720
You've graduated,

199
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,630
you're going to work soon,

200
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,840
and you're still all about games.

201
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,600
Mom.

202
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,630
You're so naïve.

203
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,670
Talking about hiring you
to play professionally.

204
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,670
Did you wash your hands yet,
if not why did you start eating already?

205
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,840
Give it to me.

206
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,910
Look at you.

207
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,870
You are a girl.

208
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Touching the keyboard all day long
and you reach for the food.

209
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,000
If you don't think that's dirty, I do.

210
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,840
Give me a hand.

211
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,870
Food's ready, Tong.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Coming.

213
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,120
Nice food today.

214
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,870
Mom,

215
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,480
what if someone was really
looking for me to play professionally?

216
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,150
So I worked so hard

217
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,320
to pay for your degree from a key university,

218
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
so that you can go play games
after you graduate?

219
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
If you're so free,

220
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,360
I'll just work harder

221
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,080
and pay for your tuition
until you finish your PhD.

222
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,460
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

223

(Skill 2: Fox Fire)

225
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,960
What should I do?

226
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,720
Why aren't you responding?

227
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,150
Biscuit, do you think I should go?

228
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,660
(Amao's Mom)

229
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,960
(How's it? Did you tell them?)

230
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,390
(Did auntie tear you into pieces?)

231
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,120
(Didn't turn out so well.)

232
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,870
(Don't get discouraged.)

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
(I'm surprised that you are still alive now.)

234
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,870
(You're still thinking about it, too, right?)

235
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
(What if we head to Shanghai
to watch the game first?)

236
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,200
(Didn't you say)

237
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,240

about professional gaming first?)

239
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,670

Hi, Mr. Rui.

256
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,200
No don't be silly, that's not our style.

257
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,120
Just call me Rui.

258
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
Here, a room card for you.

259
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Thank you.

260
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,750
By the way,

261
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,870
Cheng and the others,
do they live here too?

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,550
Yeah,

263
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,750
but they are not here now.

264
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,840
They went out for a training match.

265
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,480
You want to meet them?

266
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,080
No, no, no. Not at all.

267
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,000
Why?

268
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,910
Trainees who used to come to our base

269
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
were eager wait to see Cheng
and the others right away.

270
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,080
I want to see them, too.

271
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,440

272
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,550
It's here! Here!

273
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's go!

274
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,030
Cheng!

275
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,270
Here he comes, Lu Sicheng.

276
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,270
Cheng!

277
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,080
This is like a tour.

278
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,320
Don't know where the media

279
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,480
got the news that

280
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,600
Ming is retiring.

281
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,240
So they've been acting crazy these two days

282
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,270
and want to capture headlines.

283
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Ming is retiring?

284
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,510
Because of his hand injury?

285
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,240
Oh my god, but that's Ming.

286
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,670
That's why we need you, Miss Tong.

287
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,150
How is it? Have you considered it?

288
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,440
Do you want to join us at ZGDX?

289
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
It's okay, take your time to think.

290
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,480
Answer in no hurry.

291
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,200
But you have to know,

292
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,240
if you join us,

293
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
that'll be the biggest news of the year.

294
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,670
Don't, don't.

295
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,360

Cheng,

349
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,550
I'm feeling a bit nervous
with you looking at me like this.

350
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
I bought only one bucket of water.

351
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
How about I go and get another one in a bit?

352
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,550
There is only one bucket of water left
in the supermarket.

353
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,790
I saw a dwarf hiding it in the top shelf

354
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,790
with my own eyes.

355
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,200
Do all dwarves in the world

356
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,750
think that it's safe to hide somewhere high?

357
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,510
I can see with my chin,

358
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,510
and it's so dumb that
even I feel embarrassed for her.

359
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,680
How is there a water thief in a supermarket?

360
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,310
I literally hid it in the back of the shelf,

361
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
and still got found out!

362
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm so mad!

363
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,590
It's okay.

364
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,590
You've died about a hundred times
already from anger just now.

365

Let me ask you,

366
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,680
are you staying in the same hotel

367
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,640
with Lu Sicheng?

368
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,590
Yeah.

369
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,790
That's good.

370
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,240
Why?

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,270
You need to raid Lu Sicheng.

372
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,640
I don't think that's a good idea.

373
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,750
Think about Ai Jia, at least a little bit.

374
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,310
I'm not happy to hear that.

375
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,270
Why should I consider the feelings of my ex?

376
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
A woman's heart is the most poisonous.

377
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,270
How about you just sign the contract?

378
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,400
You happen to be good at the middle position.

379
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,480
The thought of you

380
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,790
beating up Ai Jia

381
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,590
when you are in a game

382
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,590

383

384
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,440
e-sports took away both your boyfriend

385
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,750
and your girlfriend.

386
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,830
Correct.

387
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,640
I must have had a grudge
against e-sports in my last life.

388
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,510
First my boyfriend, then my girlfriend.

389

Alright, alright.

390
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
You've said this many times.

391
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,750
Anyway, once you're done beating Ai Jia,

392
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,750
the two of you can go
on my blacklist together.

393
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,640

is having a concert here.

429
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,030
Look at those girls over there,

Oh, you're the best
because you know how to play games?

433
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,550
So you're saying those
who don't know how to play

434
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,200
don't deserve to come and watch the game?

439

who can play the game well.

the time when these girls

475

sent your boyfriend a big sword as a gift

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,270
Next,

547
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,030
let's do an interview with Captain Cheng.

548
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
As the captain of ZGDX,

549
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,240
before the game,

550
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,310
do you have anything to say with your team?

551
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,350
Do your best.

552
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,350
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

553
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,400
Our Cheng is really too profound.

554
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,440
Our competition is about to begin,

555
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,830
let us look forward to
their wonderful performance.

556
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,640
Fight on!

557
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,070
Fight on!

558
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,510
Alright.

559
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,680
To all at the venue
and in front of the screen,

560
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
greetings!

561
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,750
We're now live at

562
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
the 2020 Onmyoji Arena Pro League
Spring Final!

563
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,790
I am Dudou, someone who's been narrating
the games this entire spring,

564
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,440
and has yet to become popular.

565
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,240
I am today's commentator, Fan.

566
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,240
Let's take a look.

567
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,400
Our players

568
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,590
have entered the competition area.

569
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,270
That's right.

570
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,400
Fan, take a bold guess,

571
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,200
CK vs. ZGDX,

572
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,400
who's going to win?

573
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,750
Well from what we're looking at now,

574
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
these two teams

575
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,310
are very different in the ways they play.

576
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,550
Although they are both classic teams,

577
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,030
but they have different styles.

578
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,720
I'm guessing CK.

579
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,510
Okay. CK.

580
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
But I don't think so, actually.

581
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,070
Because ZGDX is now ranked first in points.

582
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,310
I think they have a good chance of winning.

583
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,510
Let's just wait and see.

584
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,110
Just wait and see.

585
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,270
Ok, then next up,

586
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,000
let's give the time to the audience.

587
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,070
Let's take a look at the lucky ones
who got picked by the director today.

588
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,750
Who would it be?

589
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,510
Let's see!

590
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,480
Kiss! Kiss!

591
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,550
That was PDA!

592
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,640
Too much!

593
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,830
Come on, Director, let's continue!

594
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Come on, keep going.

595
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,920
We got two ladies this time.

596
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,960
Look at the screen.

597
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,310
The director is quite something.

598
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,030
Is the director doing this for himself?

599
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,830
The girls present are very beautiful.

600
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,400
They'll blush
when the director gets to them.

601
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
What is it, Yang?

602
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,030
Sorry. Sorry.

603
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,590
Your water splashed on my keyboard.

604
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,830
Why did she come to Shanghai?

605
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,790
Who?

606
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,310
My ancestor.

607
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,110
Ancestor?

608
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,510
That's awesome.

609
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,110
Your ancestor will give you luck
and help you win!

610
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,200
The ancestor who's here to collect my debt,

611
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,920
and prays that
I'd get my legs and arms torn apart.

612
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,030
Really?

613
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,110
Ex-girlfriend?

614
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Okay, the game officially starts.

615
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,240
First, we've arrived at the BP sector.

616
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
To be friendly to

617
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,310
our new players,

618
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
we'll briefly introduce

619
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
the meaning of ban pick.

620
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,920
It means to select shikigamis and ban them.

621
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,200
Coach, this version of Yamakaze
is very strong.

622
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Let's disable it.

623
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,830
Yamakaze banned.

624
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,790
ZGDX chooses to band

625
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,480
the strong version Yamakaze.

626
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,640
Ban K's Kosodenote.

627
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,030
It's too stable
to choose this in the beginning.

628
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,550
Okay.

629
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,510
Ban Miketsu.

630
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,440
Bye bye.

631
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,880
Ban Enma.

632
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,400
(The latter two teams have banned)

633
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,880
(Kosodenote, Miketsu, and Enma.)

634
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,830
CK will probably ban Aobouzu.

635
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,310
Let's ban Satori.

636
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,400
Perfect

637
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,070
Give the last ban position to a Aobouzu.

638
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,720
Okay.

639
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,830
Okay.

640
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,000
Now that the two sides
have entered the pick section,

641
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,680
Cat, choose Menreiki for Ming.

642
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,000
Got it.

643
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,590
They've chosen the strong version

644
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,480
Menreiki.

645
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,310
Next up, CK

646
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,590
will probably choose a shikigami

647
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,310
that targets Menreiki.

648
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,830
Well to face someone
with weaker clearance ability in the early stage

649
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,830
like Menreiki,

650
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,510
I'd choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

651
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,110
Yang,

652
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

653
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,440
(Yes, I've seen her games)

654
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
(and witnessed her mind-blowing operations.)

655
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,510
(Really powerful)

656
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,550
(and full of spirits.)

657
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,110
(Right?)

658
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,110
(If you didn't target her in the early stage,)

659
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,750
(and allow her to develop,)

660
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,350
Yang.

661
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,160
Yang!

662
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,270
What are you thinking about? Lock it.

663
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,720
(Why is Yang hesitating?)

664
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
(Haven't locked it yet.)

665
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,160
(Choose Tamamo-no-Mae.)

666
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,960
Tamamo-no-Mae, Tamamo-no-Mae.

667
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,790
Tamamo-no-Mae, Tamamo-no-Mae.

668
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
(Selecting)

669
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,720
My god, what happened?

670
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Yang ended up picking Ootengu!

671
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,110
It seems like his hand trembled.

672
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,350
Jesus. What did you get me?

673
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,510
What're you doing?

674
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,550
It's over, all gone. Can't understand it.

675
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,550
You really made a wish before you came.

676
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,790
OK, OK, everyone calm down,
and do your best.

677
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,720
What's going on there
with Ootengu, Ming?

678
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,480
I don't get it.

679
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,070
Maybe it is to increase the difficulty
of the game by taking a step back.

680
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,400
Maybe his hand trembled
and clicked it by mistake.

681
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,240
Shut up.

682
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,160
It's starting.

683
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,920
Fight on! Fight on!

684
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,830
Come on, fight on! Fight on!

685
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,350
Steady down the bottom lane.

686
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,830
Don't come over.

687
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,830
Yang, squat in the grass for me.

688
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,270
Okay, coming.

689
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,310
(Yang! Yang! Yang!)

690
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,000
(Hua is deliberately
sending damage under Ming.)

691
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,400
Yang, what are you doing?

692
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,880
It's okay, don't panic.

693
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,960
Yang, stay.

694
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,030
Go.

695
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm coming.

696
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,790
(But Ming of ZGDX used the skill.)

697
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,480
(After a series of acts by K, Jian Yang died.)

698
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,350
(Congratulations.)

699
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,270
Cool. Beautiful.

700
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,400
- Beautiful!
- Ming, awesome!

701
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,510
(But we don't know
what's going on with Jian Yang,)

702
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,920
(he seems completely out of state.)

703
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,030
(Yang, what are you doing?)

704
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,680
(Okay, Yang is also resurrected again)

705
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,720
(and arrived at his jungle.)

706
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,510
(Not knowing that
K and Cat are squatting on him,)

707
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,750
(the two rushed out,)

708
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,030
(and with a set of perfect coordinated moves
they attacked Yang once again.)

709
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,440
(We can see)

710
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,750
(there's very tacit understanding.)

711
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,110
(At the same time,
Yang is being a little careless.)

712
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,720
(K attacks again and with
this wave of strong kill, Yang died again.)

713
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,200
(Rise to Prominence)
(Yang was caught and killed again.)

714
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,720
(Yang is really not in the mood today.)

715
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,400
What's up with Jian Yang today?

716
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,110
Probably a cramp in the hands.

717
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,270
Zero kills, eight deaths, and two assists.

718
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
This data is suffocating.

719
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,480
Yang, please don't give any more lives away.

720
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,240
Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

721
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,270
Take a big snake after this wave.

722
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,400
We can take it back.

723
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,750
Let's go for a snake group fight.

724
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,270
- Got it.
- Got it.

725
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,160
K, get ready to yield.

726
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,110
Coming.

727
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,310
They're taking snakes,
shall we harass them?

728
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,030
Yang.

729
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,480
Yang, wait for us, Yang!

730
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,830
(Jian Yang marked Lu Sicheng with a skill,)

731
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,550
(but it was avoided by Lu Sicheng.)

732
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,880
(Is he going to do one vs. three?)

733
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,880
(Yang gets killed once again.)

734
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,310
(Yang's operation is too impulsive.)

735
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,200
Cubby, follow me.

736
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Cat and K, get prepares to wrap the back.

737
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,960
(Second to None)
Okay. Roger that.

738
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,200
Come, retreat!

739
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,270
- Shooter, shooter retreat.
- Can't do it!

740
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,350
(Seal·Double Kill)
(Cheng is on fire!)

741
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,720
(Killed Jian Yang and got)

742
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,030
(the lives of Butterfly and Goodluck.)

743
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,790
(Chubby slowed down Wang and Hua.)

744
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,920
(K hits Hua.)

745
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,680
(Goes big next on second skill, beautiful.)

746
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,590
(Hua got killed.)

747
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,400
(They still want to go.)

748
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,000
(Let's see how they'll choose.)

749
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,680
(Yeah.)

750
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,400
(Looks fierce,
seems like another wave is coming.)

751
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,680
A wave to push it up.

752
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,270
The last wave is coming.

753
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,030
Head up, head up!

754
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,270
(Line approaches.)

755
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,960
(Breaks into middle lane base turret.)

756
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,070
(The other party is still resurrecting.)

757
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
(Can this be the wave?)

758
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,480
(Nice!)

759
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,060
(Victory)

760
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,550
(Congratulations to ZGDX
for winning the first game!)

761
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,070
ZGDX is awesome!

762
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
Good.

763
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,110
Let's go.

764
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,840
Thank you, Yang.

765
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,800
What's up with you?

766
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,960
Go.

767
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,880
- What's up today with Captain?
- Yang

768
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,880
What's up with him?

769
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,840
I don't know.

770
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,000
What's wrong?

771
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,590
Really made no progress.

772
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,000
His ex-girlfriend came to watch the game,

773
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,280
must be really stressed.

774
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,670
Well

775
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,400
do you think there are any tricks behind

776
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,760
your invitation to the game by ZGDX?

777
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,920
Go away!

778
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,030
Put away your weird conspiracy theories.

779
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,760
Hold this for me.

780
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm going to the bathroom

781
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,670
To the bathroom?

782
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Bad kidney.

783
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,630
Thank you, Yang.

784
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Sign for me.

785
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,190
Tong Yao!

786
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Sorry. Sorry.

787
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,440
Why did he leave?

788
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,960
Yang.

789
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,230
- Who's that girl?
- Tong Yao

790
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,670
What a coincidence.

791
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,150
Why did you come to Shanghai?

792
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,230
Did you come to see me play the game?

793
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
For you?

794
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,630
I saw you just now,

795
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,510
so I thought you would
definitely come to the bathroom.

796
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,590
So I waited for you here.

797
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,280
Anything you need?

798
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,000
Not really.

799
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,000
Just want to see

800
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,150
how you've been lately.

801
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Pretty good.

802
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,190
You're still mad at me.

803
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,630
I really didn't mean to not call you.

804
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,670
Our phones were put away

805
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,920
during training.

806
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,920
They were all placed with the coach.

807
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,110
Jian Yang, I'm really not mad at you.

808
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,230
I just want to tell you calmly

809
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,590
that we're over.

810
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,070
You don't need to explain this to me.

811
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,760
No, Yao.

812
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,590
Stop, don't.

813
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,800
Don't call me that.

814
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,070
Sounds weird.

815
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,000
Anything else?

816
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,760
If not, I'm leaving.

817
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,880
Tong Yao,

818
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,550
for a girl like you,

819
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,000
if you didn't come here
to see me play the game,

820
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,230
what else would you be here for?

821
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,480
Although I don't need to
explain to you either,

822
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,920
I'll still tell you.

823
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,880
I came because

824
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,030
ZGDX is asking me to play professionally.

825
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,150
Don't be kidding me.

826
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
How can a girl like you
play professionally with us?

827
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,400
Jian Yang, why are you still so silly?

828
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,400
Why can't girls play professionally?

829
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,400
Your absurd operation just now

830
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,190
was shameful enough.

831
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,670
How do you get the guts to belittle me?

832
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,800
(Mannendake!)

833
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,880
(Yang ended up choosing)

834
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,280
(the shikigami he's best at, Mannendake.)

835
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,760
Why did Yang

836
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,880
decide to choose Mannendake

837
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,920
when it's weaker in this version?

838
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,510
Well, because this shikigami, Mannendake,

839
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,590
truly requires

840
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,840
- Right.
- precise operation and timing.

841
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,320
If you can't seize advantage
in the early stage,

842
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,880
it'll be difficult to besiege

843
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,110
the opponent's core position later on.

844
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,150
If ZGDX doesn't establish an advantage
in the early stage of the game,

845
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,630
it'll be hard for it to catch up later on.

846
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,030
- Go!
- Go go go!

847
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't just push forward.

848
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,590
Kill it. Kill it.

849
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,510
Retreat, retreat!

850
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,230
Come on, keep up.

851
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,320
The opposing jungle
is working on the top lane unicorn.

852
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,590
Watch out, Ming and Cat.

853
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,710
Okay. I got it.

854
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,360
I'm going to squat.
You guys watch out for a chance.

855
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,920
(Was that a slip due to Ming's hand injury?)

856
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,360
(K, Yang is not in his own jungle area.)

857
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,320
You need to watch out.

858
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

859
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,550
(Is the best part coming up?)

860
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,440
The bottom lane unicorn has been robbed.

861
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,920
(Here we go.)

862
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,150
(Yang with the unicorn is leading by a little.)

863
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,670
(Nice shot. First blood.)

864
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,070
(Yang took out K.)

865
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,920
K, hang on.

866
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
Let's stall for time to develop ourselves.

867
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
(Let's see what Yang is doing at this point.)

868
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
(He showed his spot.)

869
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,630
Ming, lean to the left.

870
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,960
Jian Yang is in the grass to your right.

871
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,480
Looks like Yang's about to
get something going.

872
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,670
Hua, go up to seduce Ming.

873
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,400
Okay, okay.

874
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,630
(Hua is seducing.)

875
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,320
Yang is using his ultimate skill.

876
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Hua, attack!

877
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,670
Copy that.

878
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
(Sacrifice)

879
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,230
(No, why is Cheng in the middle lane?)

880
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,760
(That's odd.)

881
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,510
(Nice! That's my boy.)

882
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,320
(That was too awesome.
He was able to dodge 80% of the skills)

883
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,110
(in a one-on-two situation.)

884
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,550
Why didn't you tell me that
Cheng came to the Middle?

885
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,190
Your account was banned?

886
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,230
I saw Chubby on the line.

887
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,400
I thought Cheng had gone home.

888
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
(After gaining some advantages,)

889
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,590
(the other side chooses to advance.)

890
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,630
(The game has reached the middle stage.)

891
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,440
(The longer it stalls the less ideal
it will for CK.)

892
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
Cheng, I'll go steal a monster.

893
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,360
- Go.
- CK will not be able to beat ZGDX

894
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,030
(without a surprise move.)

895
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,960
(K over there seems to have a new move.)

896
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,510
(The direction of the monster.)

897
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,550
That was a nice containment by K.

898
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,960
K is going to hit the monster.

899
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,840
(Should we fight or grab the monster?)

900
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,880
Yang, make a decision.

901
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,800
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

902
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,710
Grab the monster.

903
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,360
(CK didn't attack the base by force.)

904
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,230
(Killed off monster)
(They're going back for the monster instead.)

905
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,550
K, surround them.

906
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,030
Coming.

907
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,630
Make it quick!

908
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,480
Yang, they're catching up.

909
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,110
Are we on?

910
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,440
Prepare for a counter-kill.

911
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,400
(Yang has showed his ultimate skill.)

912
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,230
(Get ready to start the teamfight.)

913
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,070
Kill Ming first.

914
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,920
Ming, watch out.

915
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,480
(Second to None)
(Quickly cut into the enemy lineup.)

916
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
(Ming got killed.)

917
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,670
(Ming was a second too slow.)

918
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,920
Stretch the battle line.

919
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,440
Find your position.

920
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
I got ultimate.

921
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,800
(Yang and the others are killing like crazy.)

922
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,030
(Cat was also killed by Butterfly.)

923
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,150
(Unremitting assistance)
(If the shield guard can be released in advance,)

924
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,800
(they can withstand the damage.)

925
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,880
(Now ZGDX is in danger.)

926
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,150
(Seal·Double Kill, Assist)
(Yang's first skill is followed by his second skill.)

927
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,880
(A normal attack.)

928
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,070
(Triple Kill.)

929
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,630
(ZGDX got destroyed.)

930
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
(Okay, we can see that CK)

931
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,590
(has entered ZGDX's base,)

932
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,760
(taking time to demolish the base.)

933
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
(ZGDX has no chance anymore.)

934
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,400
(Congratulations to CK
for winning the second game.)

935
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,880
(Victory)
The score is tied at one to one.

936
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,360
(Nice.)

937
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,710
(Nice. Nice.)

938
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,800
We won.

939
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,030
♪All the panic started because of you♪

940
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,800
♪Lost in your beauty♪

941
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,400
Come on, come on.

942
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Nice, nice.

943
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,440
♪I can go back trapped♪

944
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,360
(Okay, the third game now begins.)

945
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,110
(Yang has focused on Ming.)

946
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,150
(He's either catching him)

947
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,550
(or on the way to catch him.)

948
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,710
Cat, K, come and help me.

949
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,400
Coming.

950
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,820
(Defense tower requires support)

951
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,320
Cat and K.

952
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,150
Come on, up.

953
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,960
Watch out. Watch out.

954
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,710
Move back, move back.

955
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,110
(It's a fight. Hua is targeting Ming again.)

956
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,070
K turned around and blocked for Ming.

957
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,030
Yes, this is a good spot.

958
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,760
Yes, yes.

959
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,150
(Ming has killed Hua.)

960
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,000
(Oh my God, that was great coordination.)

961
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,230
Hit the snake now!

962
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,880
Right. Come on.

963
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Let's fight.

964
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,110
(What a surprise.)

965
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,670
(Ming remains calm in this round.)

966
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,440
Let's team up on the big snake together.

967
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,400
Chubby, come with me.

968
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,070
Copy that.

969
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,320
(ZGDX is taking advantage of)

970
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,510
(to hit the big snake.)

971
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,000
(If they take the big snake,)

972
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,630
(I think they'll be)

973
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,510
(the champion of this Spring Final.)

974
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,150
Taking the big snake.

975
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,880
Yang, you going? Yang.

976
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,670
I'll go, I'll g o.

977
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,150
Let's go.

978
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,840
Together.

979
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,800
Chubby, protect Ming.

980
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,480
Stand on his left.

981
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,320
All right.

982
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,280
(Go ZGDX. Go ZGDX.)

983
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,320
(The rest of CK's players
are also moving towards the snake pit.)

984
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,550
(They're gone.)

985
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,280
Watch the grass.

986
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,070
Go, go. Hit it.

987
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,400
(They have a chance.)

988
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
(Nice. Yang successfully reclaimed the snake.)

989
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,510
That was nice.

990
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,110
(Cool.)

991
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,150
(They took back the game.)

992
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,110
Good luck. Make a team fight.

993
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,000
Stretch the battle line.

994
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,190
They got the big snake, move back.

995
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,320
I'll take it, you guys retreat.

996
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,590
(A team fight broke out
after the snake is reclaimed.)

997
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,920
(ZGDX doesn't want to fight.)

998
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,840
Wang, protect the shooter.

999
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,550
Okay.

1000
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,710
(The two sides swap skills.)

1001
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Come on, let's go.

1002
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Coming.

1003
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,960
(Ming unexpectedly made a mistake just now.)

1004
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,960
(Did he have a relapse of his hand injury?)

1005
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,000
(Good luck's Kuro Douji)

1006
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,510
(is slowly moving forward to find a position.)

1007
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,280
(Chubby backhanded Kuro Douji.)

1008
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,320
Hold on. No one panic.

1009
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,760
Butterfly, watch your position.

1010
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,230
Got it.

1011
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,000
(If I'm right,)

1012
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,670
(K's ultimate skill is not ready yet.)

1013
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,110
(The command is a bit risky.)

1014
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,590
Hua, join the fight. Quick!

1015
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,150
Okay.

1016
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,360
(Lu Sicheng went big as well,)

1017
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,400
(kill off Wang and Butterfly.)

1018
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,710
(Double Kill.)

1019
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,230
(So now we've only got
Jian Yang and Lu Sicheng left on the field.)

1020
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,840
(Let's see how this will work out.)

1021
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
(Seal·Three Artifacts, Assist)

1022
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,440
(Jan Yang killed Lu Sicheng.)

1023
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
(ZGDX has been aced.)

1024
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,960
(Ultra Kill for Jian Yang. Oh my God.)

1025
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,150
(What a pity.)

1026
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,360
(CK is pushing up to the front
of the base in one go.)

1027
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,960
(ZGDX can't make a comeback.)

1028
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,840
(Okay, we see that)

1029
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,190
(Ming is coming back to life.)

1030
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,800
(Does ZGDX still have a chance?)

1031
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,710
One last go.

1032
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,150
(Ming's Manjusaka came back to life.)

1033
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,280
(No chance.)

1034
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,840
(Congratulations to CK.)

1035
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,400
(Nice.)

1036
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,760
(Champion, champion, champion.)

1037
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,000
(Yang, Yang, Yang.
Champion, champion, champion.)

1038
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,400
(Champion, champion, champion.)

1039
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:55,880
(CK, Champion. CK, Champion. CK, Champion.)

1040
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,960
Are you okay?

1041
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,400
I dragged you guys down.

1042
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
What nonsense is that?

1043
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:41,480
(CK. CK. CK.)

1044
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,000
Let's go.

1045
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,880
Ming is back.

1046
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,670
What's wrong?

1047
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,590
Why is he back?

1048
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,400
What's up?

1049
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,070
Let's sit.

1050
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Today,

1051
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,630
I have to apologize to you.

1052
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,510
Some of you may already know.

1053
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,590
I

1054
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,630
finally decided to

1055
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,150
say goodbye to this stage for the time being.

1056
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,840
A few years ago,

1057
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:41,920
I was just a

1058
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,110
newcomer in the professional team.

1059
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,710
Yes.

1060
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,070
When I was the same age as you.

1061
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
At that time, to most people,

1062
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,510
playing e-sports

1063
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,320
was not a proper job,

1064
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,630
and it had no future.

1065
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,800
Of course,

1066
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,840
my family thought the same.

1067
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,280
They asked me,

1068
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,440
what's e-sports?

1069
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,150
Is there a future for e-sports?

1070
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,030
I really didn't know how to answer it

1071
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,230
at that time.

1072
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,280
But I didn't want to give in

1073
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
when I saw the looks on their face.

1074
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,590
My heart told me

1075
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,150
that this was my dream.

1076
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,510
Professional e-sports

1077
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,320
will definitely have a promising future.

1078
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,030
So,

1079
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,480
I fought with my family,

1080
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,840
gave them the silent treatment.

1081
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,550
I even left without saying goodbye.

1082
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,510
I got on a train to Shenzhen,

1083
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,400
came to ZGDX,

1084
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,670
and became a professional e-sports player.

1085
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,760
In this time of struggle,

1086
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,840
I've fallen down

1087
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,400
and got back up

1088
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,030
with Lu Sicheng,

1089
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,960
Cat, K and Chubby in our team.

1090
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,590
I've also defined and oriented myself

1091
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,000
through these honors and setbacks

1092
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,150
in my life.

1093
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,150
Unfortunately,

1094
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,400
I have to put my dream down

1095
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,030
today.

1096
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,030
The reality of losing today's game

1097
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,480
meant that it's time for me

1098
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,110
to let go of the persistent

1099
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,230
that may have only touched myself,

1100
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,880
and to give way to the young generation.

1101
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,670
Although I can't make it,

1102
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,960
I know that

1103
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,920
as long as the dream lives on,

1104
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,440
there will always be someone

1105
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
to take my place on this stage

1106
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,590
and go on the path carrying my dream.

1107
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,760
I hope that this person

1108
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,480
can make a decision soon.

1109
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,150
I hope that one day,

1110
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,590
when ZGDX

1111
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,400
gets the trophy,

1112
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm still here.

1113
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,630
You guys,

1114
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,880
as well.

1115
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,960
Now.

1116
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,920

a team member of ZGDX,

1119
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,590
officially register to retire

1120
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,480
after this Spring Final.

1121
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,230
Fight on, Ming!

1122
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,150
Fight on, Ming!

1123
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,280
Ming, we will always stand by you!

1124
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,360
Fight on, Ming!

1125
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,630
Fight on, Ming!

1126
00:47:42,800 --> 00:48:01,630

(The dream never dies)

1134
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,030
- I'm sorry.
- Take a look.

1135
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,880
- I'm sorry, not now.
- Sign for me.

1136
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,840
Sign for me, too. Yang.

1137
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,760
- Tong Yao.
- Yang.

1138
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,710
Excuse me.

1139
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,670
I'll wait for you at the door.

1140
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,440
Call me if you need anything.

1141
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,150
I really care about you.

1142
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,440
That's why I said
those things to you just now.

1143
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,590
Why did you join ZGDX?

1144
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Who is this girl?

1145
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,280
Why is Yang talking to her?

1146
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,480
She's not pretty, either.

1147
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,360
I know right?

1148
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,710
Who are you?

1149
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,480
Why is she so close to Yang?

1150
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,070
I know.

1151
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,630
Let's go.

1152
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,670
Let go of me.

1153
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,510
Are you serious?

1154
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,880
Did you really sign with ZGDX?

1155
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,760
Yes, I did.

1156
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,110
It should have been announced
officially by now.

1157
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,840
I thought you didn't want me
to be a professional player.

1158
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,150
Then why did you come to be one yourself?

1159
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,230
Because I want to.

1160
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,150
What does it have to do with you?

1161
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,000
It doesn't.

1162
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,920
I'm just curious,

1163
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,550
why you didn't tell me
you are going to be a professional player.

1164
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,800
Isn't it better for you to join our team

1165
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,320
than ZGDX?

1166
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,630
Why should I tell it to you?

1167
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,710
And why should I join your team?

1168
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,150
Because I'm there.

1169
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,400
One more time,

1170
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,670
who are you?

1171
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,630
I taught you how to play.

1172
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,670
I was the one who downloaded the App

1173
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,590
in your computer.

1174
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,550
If you want to be a professional,

1175
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,360
you should come to my team.

1176
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,920
Come on, how many times have I told you?

1177
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,920
It has nothing to do with you.

1178
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,800
You always remind me that
you taught me how to play.

1179
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,400
What? You want to get some tuition?

1180
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,230
Tong Yao.

1181
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,800
You want to piss me off, don't you?

1182
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,630
Jian Yang.

1183
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,920
You should just focus on your career.

1184
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,800
Look how you got yourself killed

1185
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,440
on three roads in the first game.

1186
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,920
It's so embarrassing.

1187
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,280
What's wrong with that?

1188
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,320
If you had told me earlier
that you joined them,

1189
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,630
I could've continued doing that
in the second and third game.

1190
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,710
Consider it a gift for you.

1191
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
How nice would it be
to give your future boss a championship?

1192
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,030
We don't need you

1193
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,280
to give us the championship.

1194
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,030
We can get it ourselves.

1195
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,190
Yao.

1196
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,670
Let's talk, okay?

1197
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,150
Did you join ZGDX to piss me off?

1198
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,000
How many times have I told you?

1199
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,070
It's my dream to
play e-sports professionally.

1200
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,590
It has nothing to do with you.

1201
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,150
Okay.

1202
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
In that case,

1203
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,800
I won't show you any mercy

1204
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,320
on the battlefield in the future.

1205
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,480
Okay, I'll see you there.

1206
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,440
Cheng, what are you doing here?

1207
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,550
Eating a lollipop.

1208
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,800
I just found out we have a new player
on our team as well.

1209
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,800
You guys know each other?

1210
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,800
You heard us?

1211
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,070
It was so loud.

1212
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,550
It's hard not to.

1213
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,480
Interesting.

1214
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,030
I'm saying the newcomer in our team,

1215
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,190
she's interesting.
