1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,660
(The jungler Dragon from DQ.Five)

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,740
(dated a woman other than his girlfriend.)

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,910
(The jungler Dragon from DQ.Five)

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,560
(dated a woman other than his girlfriend.)

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,030
(Dragon wasn't wearing the same clothes
while live streaming)

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,000
(as in the photo at all.)

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,350
(So the person who was caught
on camera this morning)

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,480
(is definitely not Hsu Tae-lun.)

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,390
Watching a movie?

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,120
You must have mistaken someone else for me.

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,280
(At 2 p.m. at Wantai Cinema,)

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,190
(I ran into Smiling and Chessman.)

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
(What's going on between them?)

14
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,350
(They went to see the movie alone together?)

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,160
(Isn't that the same time)

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,920
(that the person being suspected
as Hsu Tae-lun)

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,750
(went to see that movie?)

18
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,240
(The background in the photo of his back)

19
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,000
(is also Wantai Cinema.)

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,670
(On the wall…)

21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,920
There were indeed a few people

22
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,320
who came in the dark
after the movie had started.

23
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,320
As for who they were,

24
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,840
why don't you go ask him yourself

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,030
if you're so curious?

26
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,240
(Watch out, Dragon.)

27
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,670
(Your secret is about to be revealed.)

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,700
=Falling into Your Smile=

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,500
=Episode 20=

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,150
The combat gains ratio
on the field is now 7:5.

31
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,040
ZGDX is economically ahead of DQ.Five

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,480
(by nearly 1,500.)

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,870
(This doesn't make sense.)

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,070
(Today's Dragon seems to
have no strategy at all.)

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,560
All he sees is the middle lane.
All he ganks is the middle lane.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,960
This is not Dragon we seemed to know.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,840
Look.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,400
(After clearing the monster,)

39
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,150
(he appears in the grass
in the upper part of the middle lane)

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,710
(at a completely impossible)

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,150
(and implausible time,)

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,800
(preparing to gank Smiling
for the fifth time.)

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,000
(He's crossed the line.)

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,800
I knew it.

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,430
Is the opponent's jungler
going to live in our middle lane?

46
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,560
Is there gold in the middle lane?

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,430
Yes, come and take a look.

48
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,430
Jungler and support, roam.

49
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,150
So noisy.

50
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,080
Wonderful!

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,030
(Hakurou's ultimate skill)

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
(fixed Yamakaze under the turret
for a few seconds,)

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,590
(long enough for him
to take all the damage from the turret.)

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,630
You can even hit him from this angle.

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,800
(He keeps attacking Yamakaze.)

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,630
The opponent thinks that it's enough
to suppress our middle lane.

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
Don't forget that our ADC
on the bottom lane can also carry.

58
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,470
Cheng's performance could totally get on

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,310
the top of the list of heroes
saving damsels in distress.

60
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,960
(So far in the game,)

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
(Chubby and Chessman)

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,030
(on the bottom lane
have started to destroy the turret.)

63
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,240
(Smiling is controlling Shiro Douji.)

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
(She just replenished a wave of soldiers)

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,310
(while Dragon controlled Yamakaze
and has arrived at the middle lane again.)

66
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,590
(Dragon's Yamakaze rushed out
from the grass,)

67
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,590
(flying with a second skill.)

68
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,150
(At the same time,)

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,680
(Smiling didn't hesitate to
instantly flash back to the turret.)

70
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,710
(The opponent directly followed
in a teleport.)

71
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,710
Tong Yao, your equipment isn't right.

72
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,520
There is not enough damage. Withdraw.

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
(It handed over the first skill
to deal a quick set of damage,)

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
(and slowed down Yamakaze
in front of the turret with the third skill.)

75
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,560
(Yamakaze directly flashed onto Shiro Douji,)

76
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,630
(using the ultimate skill and
then a combo-move to kill Shiro Douji.)

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,520
(I feel that Smiling)

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,030
(must be nearly going crazy right now.)

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,630
I told you I should take Yuki Onna this time.

80
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,870
Hsu Tae-lun

81
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,120
can't get enough today, can he?

82
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,030
He keeps ganking.

83
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,960
(I feel like he is just taking it
out on Smiling.)

84
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,590
(I'll be honest with you.)

85
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,590
(I think this is already a bit rude.)

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,560
(I really don't know)

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
(what DQ. Five actually wants to do.)

88
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,680
After watching the game for over 10 minutes,

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,750
I've only seen one thing,

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
that they want to kill Smiling.

91
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,280
They have to kill Smiling.

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,430
They insist on killing Smiling.

93
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,680
I think you shouldn't talk too much, Dudou.

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,910
(Don't say that I didn't warn you.)

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
(And don't ask me why.)

96
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,680
(Go look at the comments of the DQ.Five fans)

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,630
(on your blogs later.)

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
(You will know why.)

99
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,400
K, come here.

100
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,840
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming now.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
(Don't go to the middle lane.
We have no vision.)

102
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,190
(K's Kairaishi)

103
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,680
(has already been waiting in ambush
in the river-way of middle lane…)

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,150
I'm coming.

105
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,590
(in case Yamakaze ganks Smiling again.)

106
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,630
(He started the fight anyway.)

107
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,910
(Hsu Tae-lun completely ignored Kairaishi,)

108
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,870
(taking a surprise move towards Smiling.)

109
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
(At the same time, DQ.Five's Zhou
has also arrived at the middle lane.)

110
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,710
(Dragon killed Smiling.)

111
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,750
(But he was also easily killed)

112
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,800
(by K's Kairaishi.)

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,950
Is it worth it? One for one.

114
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,800
(Wounded the enemy by 1,000
and damaged himself by 800.)

115
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,190
(I think DQ.Five wounded the enemy by 800)

116
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,390
(and damaged himself by 1,200.)

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
Dragon just got addicted to

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
ganking Smiling.

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,510
Yes, it's true.

120
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,920
(Now twenty minutes)

121
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
(have passed in the game.)

122
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,310
(ZGDX has pushed up to
the base turret in the middle lane.)

123
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,270
Cheng, I'm on. I'm in a good position.

124
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,920
Okay.

125
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,000
(K starts the team fight first.)

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,950
(Smiling slowed
the three opponents in a teleport.)

127
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,120
(An ultimate skill blew up the opponents.)

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,630
Come on, come on.

129
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,360
(Smiling was constantly ganked
in the previous stage.)

130
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,240
(She can't output severe damage now.)

131
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
- We can do it.
- Up, up, up.

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,950
We can take the fight this time.

133
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,870
- Don't retreat, don't retreat, go.
- We can make it.

134
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,430
DQ.Five wants to take the fight this time.

135
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,310
(They're on.)

136
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,390
(All skills are taken out)

137
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,160
(on Cat and Smiling.)

138
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,070
Cat was killed.

139
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,800
(Chessman has got a good chance
to attack at this point.)

140
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,750
(Chessman is now attacking
like crazy in the back.)

141
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,120
(Defeat)
(One, two.)

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
(Still going on, still going on, three.)

143
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,870
(Four! Nice! Ultra Kill!)

144
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,000
Awesome, Cheng.

145
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,160
(Yamakaze, Yamakaze has come back to life.)

146
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,040
(Can you turn the tables, Yamakaze?)

147
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,120
(Yamakaze is rushing out.)

148
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,560
No, guard the base. Guard the base.

149
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,560
Why do you keep chasing her?

150
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,540
(Perfect Power)
Guard the base.

151
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,040
(This is a bit too much, isn't it?)

152
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,800
(The enemy is already destroying their base)

153
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,040
(while Dragon is still)

154
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,360
(persistently killing Smiling.)

155
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,430
It seems like killing Smiling
in the middle lane

156
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,190
(is more important
than his own base in this match.)

157
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,390
(Yes, ZGDX has no more obstacles
at this point,)

158
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,390
(dismantling the opponent's base methodically.)

159
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,000
Nice job!

160
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,070
(Let's congratulate ZGDX again)

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,390
for winning the game!

162
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,240
What's going on in their heads?

163
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,390
Ask them.

164
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,560
It's so baffling.

165
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,950
What the hell was Hsu Tae-lun doing?

166
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,680
K, what do you think he was up to?

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,270
I can only see that
he wanted to kill Tong Yao.

168
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,310
I really didn't see anything else.

169
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,560
Could he really have bought

170
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,920
what Tong Yao said during the live streaming

171
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,270
and so was taking revenge?

172
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,560
Miss.

173
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,120
I heard that you didn't help him to clear
his name and were also sarcastic.

174
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,120
I have no obligation to help him lie.

175
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,870
Good point. A liar doesn't grow any taller.

176
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,240
No way... He did that kind of thing
in an official game.

177
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,270
How could your teammates agree?

178
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,070
What's wrong with losing a little group game?

179
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,920
Besides,

180
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,950
DQ.Five is a four-preserving-one team.

181
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,600
Four Chinese in the team protect one Korean.

182
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,950
I really want to laugh.

183
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,070
See?

184
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,920
That's sarcasm.

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
You're the best at being sarcastic.

186
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,720
I'm really impressed with you.

187
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm going to the bathroom.

188
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,160
We'll play four-preserving-one
in the next match.

189
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,190
I'll play anything.

190
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
If he keeps ganking me like this,

191
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,190
I'll still get killed even
if I take an ultimate tough Shikigami

192
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,830
and ambush in the middle lane
toughly equipped.

193
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
As long as we can win the game.

194
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,680
If he still lives in the middle lane
like that next time,

195
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,830
would one of you please report him
after the match

196
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,680
for foul play?

197
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,270
Nice! I thought she was gonna cry!

198
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,560
Me too.

199
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,800
I think she's just mad.

200
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,830
Are you going in or not?

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
Yes, yes, let's go.

202
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,100
(Jinyang)

203
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,310
Hello, Jinyang.

204
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,950
(I'm so angry, Yao.)

205
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,750
(I just saw that bastard
Hsu Tae-lun bullying you.)

206
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,870
(I'm so angry.)

207
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,750
(What kind of behavior was that?)

208
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,070
(Does he have any professionalism at all?)

209
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,040
Yeah.

210
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,510
I'm really speechless.

211
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,430
That Hsu…

212
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,160
I'll talk to you later.

213
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,830
What's up?

214
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
Can't I come to you for nothing?

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,510
Your Chinese is quite good.

216
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,830
But you can't.

217
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,830
The other day on the air,

218
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,390
why did you say such embarrassing things?

219
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,560
Why didn't you just deny it?

220
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,190
I can say anything I want to.

221
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Besides, it's good that I didn't reveal you.

222
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
So you did that to get back at me

223
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,920
in today's game?

224
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,430
Because I was

225
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,430
not happy.

226
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,630
Your team lost the game because of you.

227
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,310
I don't care.

228
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,040
They...

229
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,950
They won't object either.

230
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,070
I've taken them to win many times.

231
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,600
It's no big deal

232
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,240
that I do whatever I want once in a while.

233
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
And I can do more.

234
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,270
I can even lose to you soon too

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,910
in the next game.

236
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,120
But you have to promise me.

237
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,840
Be a good girl.

238
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,790
Who are you looking for?

239
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,510
Lu Sicheng?

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,750
Don't look.

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
Your teammates are in the lounge.

242
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,960
No one will come to your rescue at this time.

243
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,960
I don't need any rescuers.

244
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,270
You're not sick, are you?

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
My mom said that
disease comes in from the mouth.

246
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,790
What's going on?

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,390
What?

248
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,720
Look in the mirror.
You're as pale as a ghost.

249
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,670
I'm fine.

250
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,790
What's going on?

251
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,200
How did Hsu Tae-lun hurt his hand?

252
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,550
Will it affect the game?

253
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,000
How could you say you're fine?

254
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,910
Why are you making eyes at

255
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,910
the jungler from the other team?

256
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,440
That's how you use the term "making eyes"?

257
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,390
I'm clearly glaring…

258
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,000
Forget it.

259
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,000
Just play the game first.

260
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Explain clearly after we get back.

261
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,670
Otherwise you won't be entering the base.

262
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,910
As for the last two positions,

263
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,550
choose Ibaraki Douji and Yuki Onna.

264
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,360
Okay.

265
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,980
(Onmyoji Arena)

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,550
All right.

267
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,840
Let's go.

268
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

269
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Now that players
from both sides have chosen their

270
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,670
list of shikigamis for the second game.

271
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,270
(ZGDX's topsolo, Cat)

272
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,670
(has taken Kuro Douji.)

273
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,720
(Jungler K has picked Ibaraki Douji.)

274
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,670
(The midsolo Smiling has picked Yuki Onna.)

275
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,200
(Shooter Chessman is using Chin)

276
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,390
(while support Chubby is Ichimoku Ren.)

277
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,390
(Looking at DQ.Five now.)

278
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,270
(The top lane is Hannya,
the jungler is Mannendake.)

279
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,000
(The middle lane is Higanbana,
the bottom lane is Youko,)

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,030
(and support, Ebisu.)

281
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,150
The battle is about to begin at any moment.

282
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,360
Let's wait for a while

283
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,080
before going into the game.

284
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,550
(Mannendake)

285
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,440
(is already waiting in ambush
in the grass in the middle lane.)

286
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,550
(Will this game be a repeat of)

287
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,720
(the last game?)

288
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,080
Why is it starting again?

289
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,510
Yes, what's going on?

290
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,840
(But it's obvious that Smiling's Yuki Onna)

291
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,960
(is being much more self-aware
and is only replenishing the soldiers under the turret.)

292
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,030
(Mannendake has no chance.)

293
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,600
Chubby, follow me.

294
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
Roger, go.

295
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,440
(Dragon's Mannendake was caught by Chessman)

296
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,790
(while anti-jungling.)

297
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,360
(He seemed to be trying to fight.)

298
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
(Mannendake has turned in his flash.)

299
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
(Could they still be planning to chase?)

300
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,790
Chase.

301
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,080
- What's going on?
- What's going on here?

302
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know.

303
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,600
(The two shikigamis on the bottom lane
have started to wander towards the middle lane.)

304
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,000
(Chessman went to the middle lane
in the early stage.)

305
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,030
(Has he ignored the line?)

306
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,790
(We should know that
the shooter's development)

307
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,150
(is crucial.)

308
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,030
(Ambushing Smiling's Yuki Onna
in the middle lane)

309
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,390
(turns out to be nothing.)

310
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,510
(He's gone back to the bottom lane
to continue to develop.)

311
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,600
(At this time, Dragon
has come out of the jungle.)

312
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,550
(He came out just after Chessman left.)

313
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,120
(At this moment, Lu Sicheng and Chubby
are immediately rushing back to the middle lane)

314
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,240
(to surprise him.)

315
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,600
(Yuki Onna isn't dead yet at this time,)

316
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,030
(and is making a skill instead.)

317
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
(ZGDX's Chessman and Chubby)

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,270
(have arrived at the middle lane.)

319
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,360
(Killingspree )
(He's killed Dragon and Zhou)

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,550
(with a set of skills,)

321
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,630
(completing a Double Kill.)

322
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,200
It's too late! It's too late!

323
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
Good.

324
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,270
Come to the monster for a team fight.
Gather here.

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm here.

326
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,270
- I'm coming.
- I'm coming.

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,720
Check if the opposite jungler is here.

328
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,390
(Now both sides have reached level 15)

329
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,670
(and have arrived around the monster
at the same time.)

330
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,270
- Controlled.
- There is a fight happening.

331
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,360
(At this moment, Dragon)

332
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,390
(suddenly went around
to the back row of ZGDX.)

333
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,750
(Smiling in the back row is in danger again.)

334
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,120
(Chessman and Chubby both went up together.)

335
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
(The team fight continues.)

336
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,120
(Dragon is dead again.)

337
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,270
(Now it's a four-on-five situation.)

338
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,320
Thank you, Cheng, for saving my life.

339
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,790
(Defeat)
Cheng, Cheng, Cheng.

340
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,630
(Ace.)

341
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,670
(No more suspense in this game.)

342
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,200
(ZGDX is about to destroy their base.)

343
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

344
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,720
(Cheng, hit the turret!)

345
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,910
(Taking advantage of this ace,)

346
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,720
(ZGDX is now attacking
the base methodically.)

347
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
(Chessman isn't hitting the turret.)

348
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,360
(He stands under DQ.Five's base now.)

349
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,550
(Five, four, three, two, one.)

350
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
(Mannendake has been revived.)

351
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,510
(Chessman isn't hitting the base)

352
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,670
(but is rushing into
the opponent's base instead.)

353
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
(What did I just see?)

354
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
(Dragon was killed by Chessman
inside the base.)

355
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,720
(Cheng is teasing them.)

356
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,550
Our Cheng is on a killing spree today.

357
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,270
He pounced into the base
like a tiger leaping at its prey,

358
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,960
and beat Hsu Tae-lun to a pulp.

359
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,600
"In me the tiger sniffs the rose".

360
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
(I was talking to you about the tiger.)

361
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,480
(Why did you mention some roses?)

362
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,270
Go away.

363
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,510
We can see he isn't even hitting
the base anymore.

364
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,120
As soon as Dragon's Mannendake was revived,

365
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,480
Chessman killed him once more.

366
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,150
This is revenge for what happened before.

367
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,600
(Let me tell you.)

368
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,630
(If I were Smiling,)

369
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,630
(I would have been moved to tears, you know?)

370
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,200
(I'm so touched indeed.)

371
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,960
(Such a good Chessman.)

372
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
(Such a good captain.)

373
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,670
(What more could I ask for?)

374
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,150
It seems that this four-preserving-one lineup

375
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,360
wasn't to give up their
own midsolo to protect the shooter,

376
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,320
but Lu Sicheng, the shooter

377
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,750
went to protect the midsolo with the support.

378
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,000
Didn't you bully our midsolo?

379
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,750
Then I will return the favor.

380
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,550
An eye for an eye.

381
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,270
Nice!

382
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,440
Let's congratulate ZGDX

383
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,030
for winning the fifth match
of the group game.

384
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Hello, Tong Yao.

385
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,320
Hello.

386
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
Hello everyone, I'm Tong Yao.

387
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,630
You were constantly targeted
in today's games.

388
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,510
Are you angry?

389
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,440
At first, I was a little angry.

390
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,200
Then I wasn't angry anymore.

391
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,440
We won the game.

392
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,790
It's the same for anyone to carry the game.

393
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,240
Besides, anyone in a strong team

394
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,000
should be able to carry.

395
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,270
We should be able to depend on anyone.

396
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Liners at different positions

397
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,240
come to carry in every game.

398
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,200
That's good.

399
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,240
Today your teammates

400
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,910
employed the four-preserving-one tactic

401
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to protect you as the middle lane

402
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,390
and won the game.

403
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,120
Do you have anything to say about this?

404
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,320
Cheng's Chin is very capable.

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,550
Remember to ban him next time.

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,910
So, do you think

407
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,630
the extreme tactics
used by your opponents against you

408
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,750
worked?

409
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,960
Or at least worked at one time?

410
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,510
I think

411
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,910
that with the two remaining lanes
being more advantageous,

412
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,550
it's not going to work by targeting me.

413
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,840
My teammates are no cowards either.

414
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,200
ZGDX is a triple core team.

415
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,600
I believe if any one of them
gets economically advantageous,

416
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,320
he'll be confident enough
to take over the rest of the game.

417
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,320
Do you agree with this kind of attitude?

418
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,080
What's going on?

419
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,150
Your questions today are scaring me.

420
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,840
I don't know

421
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,080
if it's the opponent's tactics

422
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,910
or the player's personal thoughts.

423
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,840
But I think as the core of a team,

424
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,790
he's supposed to be

425
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,200
responsible for his teammates and team.

426
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,630
That's the most basic thing, right?

427
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,720
Rumor has it that it was about the previous

428
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,910
incident of Hsu Tae-lun

429
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
dating a fan.

430
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,080
Some comments you made
during the live streaming

431
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,910
have led some people to think it's true.

432
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,320
Do you think it's related to that?

433
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,390
I don't know what I said.

434
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,670
But

435
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,080
if there is nothing wrong
with the person himself,

436
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,200
nothing and no one
can put him into a state of adversity.

437
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,270
I believe

438
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,870
Hsu Tae-lun himself also knows this.

439
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,030
Why are you here?

440
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,910
Give me the microphone.

441
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,080
Today

442
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,840
Smiling is just

443
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,720
answering your questions.

444
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,790
I sincerely hope that everyone here

445
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,750
can report the truth.

446
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't want her to walk out of this door

447
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,200
only to find that
what she said has been completely distorted.

448
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,000
I know that some media outlets sometimes

449
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
try to take things out of context

450
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,880
to get attention.

451
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,350
But this is about the reputation of a player.

452
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,030
Please be mindful

453
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,200
about what and how you're gonna write.

454
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,000
Let's go.

455
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,110
Thank you.

456
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,640
Happy.

457
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,110
Lu Yue, we agreed to play a father-son game.

458
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,240
Let's solo.

459
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,590
I'd like to have RIO, the iced kind.

460
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,200
K's treat.

461
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,070
Why should I?

462
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,510
Because you won MVP.

463
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,790
Smiling also won MVP.

464
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,310
Smiling was docked two months' salary.

465
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,640
They let me win MVP

466
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,920
just because they want to
gossip about me and Hsu Tae-lun…

467
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Let's go.

468
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,750
Confess.

469
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,240
Think before you speak.

470
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,680
At halftime,

471
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,270
I met Hsu Tae-lun in front of the bathroom.

472
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,000
He asked me
why I didn't help him to clear his name

473
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,350
but said something ambiguous
to trap him instead

474
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
when I was asked about
the movie theater thing

475
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,720
during the previous live streaming.

476
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,480
What did you say?

477
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,480
I own my own mouth.

478
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,680
I say what I like to say.

479
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,160
Good point. And then what?

480
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,510
Then he asked me if I would shut up

481
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,830
if he let us win.

482
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,830
We could win the game with our own ability.

483
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,000
Why should he let us win?

484
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,110
I said no.

485
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,310
Then I bit him

486
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,110
and ran away.

487
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,550
What?

488
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,640
I ran away.

489
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,480
The previous sentence.

490
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,000
I said no.

491
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,960
The second sentence.

492
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,920
I bit him.

493
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,000
You said you wouldn't let me hit people.

494
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,720
I can bite then, can't I?

495
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,920
It's not like I'd bite him to death.

496
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,680
So when the second game started,

497
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,350
Hsu Tae-lun had gauze on his arm

498
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,400
because you bit him?

499
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,310
That's right.

500
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,960
Stand here and don't go next door.

501
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,440
Don't open the door for her.

502
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,070
Cheng.

503
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,110
What's wrong with her?

504
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,550
She looked for something
to eat in the trash can.

505
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,790
I asked her to stand outside
to get rid of the smell.

506
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,920
Trash can?

507
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,880
Is she that unhygienic?

508
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Just pretend he didn't say that.

509
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,750
She just made Cheng angry.

510
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,200
What?

511
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,620
(Roly Poly)

512
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,110
Chubby, open the door for me.

513
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,270
I can't help you.

514
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,110
Mr. Lu's takeout.

515
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,590
Give it to me. Give it to me.

516
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,680
Miss.

517
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,680
It's such a hot day.

518
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,030
What are you doing out here alone?

519
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,590
Feeding the mosquitoes.

520
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,720
Thank you.

521
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,720
Hello?

522
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,200
(Two choices.)

523
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,720
(Sent to Lu Sicheng)
(Either let me in)

524
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,830
(or I'll be bitten to death
by mosquitoes outside)

525
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,240
(while you'll be starved to death inside.)

526
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,920
(Make the choice yourself.)

527
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Your takeout is ready.

528
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,830
Please count them.

529
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,240
That's fine, thank you.

530
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,830
I'll take this.

531
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,510
- This is for you. Here you go.
- Thank you.

532
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,510
What's this? A burger?

533
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,790
A burger.

534
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,720
I'll get you a coffee.

535
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,550
Okay, thanks.

536
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,920
A hamburger.

537
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I didn't order yours.

538
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,550
No, I saw it.

539
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,110
Take it outside to eat.

540
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,240
You know you've made a mistake now?

541
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,200
Yes, I know.

542
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,110
What should you do the next time
when you encounter such a situation?

543
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,960
Turn around and run,
call the police and call for help.

544
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,750
Call who?

545
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,070
Okay, okay, I know.

546
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,920
Call who?

547
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,000
You.

548
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,000
Sit down and eat.

549
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,110
This guy is so mean.

550
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,790
Why do you keep staring at him

551
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
with such a focus?

552
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,830
You... Why are you here again?

553
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,640
Because you need me.

554
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,640
What's so great about this guy?

555
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,550
What do you know?

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,750
He is the Chessman
who can carry on the gaming field.

557
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,960
He's so handsome in his promotional photos
that he could enter the entertainment industry.

558
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,830
He doesn't talk much in the studio
and is occasionally ironic with his fans.

559
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,350
My idol, he has no flaws.

560
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,640
He is proud, conceited, and bitchy

561
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,070
with habitually indifferent expressions.

562
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,550
He has countless tricks.

563
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,750
When he's in a good mood,
he'll tease his teammates.

564
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,830
When he's in a bad mood,
he'll be so cold to others.

565
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,680
Whenever he doesn't play,
he won't wash his face or shave.

566
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,070
Obviously, he has a lot of clothes,
each piece of which is very expensive.

567
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,350
But he likes to wear the big shirts

568
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,920
bought by Chubby for 39.9 yuan
on Taobao with free shipping.

569
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,920
If you still want to listen,
I can go on talking.

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I won't listen to you.

571
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,310
Chubby.

572
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,750
Did you grow up eating tissue paper?

573
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,830
I just put a new pack here yesterday.

574
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,680
Today it's gone.

575
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,310
How can I wipe my ass?

576
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,000
It seems that your idol also has to
go to the toilet himself.

577
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,480
Even so,

578
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,240
even if he loses his idol's halo,

579
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,830
he's still very attractive to me.

580
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,030
If you even think he's cute

581
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,750
holding up his pants in search of tissues,

582
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,030
cursing and swearing.

583
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,000
Then you're in big trouble.

584
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,310
We're going.

585
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,200
To where?

586
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,640
To show Biscuit the life of an aristocat.

587
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,590
Get in.

588
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,880
I'll drop you off on the way.

589
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,400
Where are you going?

590
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
To wash my car.

591
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,030
Didn't you just wash it
the day before yesterday?

592
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,750
Get in.

593
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,790
Put your seat belt on.

594
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
Don't go anywhere. I'll pick you up later.

595
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,820
(Playful Pet Hospital)

596
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,830
Hello, welcome.

597
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,590
Hello, I have an appointment today.

598
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,200
My tail phone number is 0305.

599
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,680
Okay.

600
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,110
Here.

601
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,960
Do you know how sad I am?

602
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,160
Every night

603
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,750
I have to rely on sleeping pills
to fall asleep.

604
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,590
Can you…

605
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,640
I know you.

606
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,350
You're the midsolo of ZGDX, right?

607
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
I saw you at
the flower and bird market that day.

608
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,480
I was with Tae-lun.

609
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,270
What happened to the kitten?

610
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,240
It might be cat fever.

611
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,240
And there are too many people at the base,

612
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,830
which has caused it
to become nervous and so on.

613
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,880
I really shouldn't have taken it
to the cinema that day.

614
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,200
Tae-lun doesn't have time to take care of it.

615
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,030
So he asked me to bring it to the vet.

616
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,790
But I have to go to the office
to clock in later.

617
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,030
Can you take care of her for a while?

618
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,960
I'll be back in 10 minutes to pick her up.

619
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm counting on you.

620
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,920
Good girl. Come on.

621
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,510
If you didn't want to keep her,
then why did you buy her?

622
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,030
Tong Yao.

623
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,590
Did you hear what Hsu Tae-lun said

624
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,590
during the live streaming?

625
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,110
I did.

626
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,240
Is it worth it?

627
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,980
(Blood smear report form)

628
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,000
What's wrong, kitty?

629
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,400
So soon?

630
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,350
Why do you have Hsu Tae-lun's cat?

631
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,720
I just met Hsu Tae-lun's…

632
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,640
You know who.

633
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,830
She brought her cat to see a vet,

634
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,750
saying it seems to
have some kind of cat fever.

635
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,960
But I saw the test results say

636
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,240
it's just a common cold.

637
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,720
Captain.

638
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,160
How many games would I be banned for
if I abducted someone's cat?

639
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,510
Are you crazy?

640
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,030
I want to commit a crime.

641
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,000
You stole the…

642
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,110
Keep your voice down.

643
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,920
If the shopkeeper hears you later,

644
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,510
he'll think I really do want to do something.

645
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,000
This is already someone else's cat.

646
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,880
I know.

647
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,640
I can't really steal it.

648
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,920
Your cat is already well.

649
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,880
Look at how much the cat hates you.

650
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,680
Let's go.

651
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,790
Smiling, thank you
for taking care of her for me.

652
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,510
Let's go.

653
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,000
She's not going to send the cat
back to the DQ.Five's base, is she?

654
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,200
Hsu Tae-lun's fans

655
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
seem to like that cat.

656
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,030
I think she will send it back.

657
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
Don't tell me
you're going to steal it from the base.

658
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,240
Don't even think about it. Let's go.

659
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,680
Yeah, she got the shot.

660
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,030
I asked the staff this afternoon

661
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,680
to take her to get the injection for me.

662
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,680
(Staff.)

663
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,720
(It's okay, it's okay.)

664
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,830
(It's not the cat fever.)

665
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,000
It's just a cold.

666
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
(She's much better now.)

667
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,000
I'd have liked to take her myself.

668
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
But I had a training match this afternoon.

669
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,070
I won the training match.

670
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,790
(Who was I playing with?)

671
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,480
(I won't tell you.)

672
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,160
Girlfriend?

673
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,110
Yes, Jiaqi likes her too.

674
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,510
We raise her together.

675
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,400
He's not as good as that idiot Li Hengshuo.

676
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:38,960
Good girl.

677
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,830
What's wrong with you?
You hate him but you still want to watch him.

678
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,160
Get out of the way.
Don't turn off my live streaming.

679
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,960
Although I hate him,

680
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,350
that doesn't stop me
from watching him in live streaming.

681
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,070
This man is full of lies.

682
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,350
Someone who can lie whenever he wants.

683
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,440
How rare is that?

684
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,440
This is a living textbook

685
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,200
which teaches us that

686
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,200
men in the e-sports industry
are not desirable.

687
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,790
What crazy talk is that?

688
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,960
Men's mouths, ghosts of deception.

689
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,030
Just cause you can't meet a good one

690
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,790
and you start talking nonsense here.

691
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,790
What do you mean I can't meet a good one?

692
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,070
I should be to blame?

693
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,400
Then tell me.

694
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,640
How many good men are there
in the e-sports industry

695
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,920
who are good at playing games,

696
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,480
handsome and also patient?

697
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,960
The kind who don't cheat or screw around.

698
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:23,960
There are.

699
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,070
Who?

700
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,240
Me.

701
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,830
Me. Want to try?

702
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,160
What are you talking about?

703
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,270
What's going on?

704
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,960
I'm just saying it.

705
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,440
Look at you, so easily fooled.

706
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,790
Can you just say something like that?

707
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

708
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
I can say whatever I want.

709
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,480
Do you think the captain
has been acting strange lately?

710
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,440
For example?

711
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,550
First, he went out on a movie date
which was almost unprecedented.

712
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,070
And then he also flirted in public.

713
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
He's been going out
and washing his car a lot.

714
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,160
Now that you mention it,

715
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
that the captain has been acting
really weird lately.

716
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,400
Isn't that right?

717
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,110
Is that so?

718
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,070
Which part do you think is odd?

719
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,240
The captain

720
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,480
has been drinking water a lot lately.

721
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,590
(Men in the e-sports industry, eww.)

722
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,510
(I just want to have some peace
and quiet for a while.)

723
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,510
Hsu Tae-lun is in trouble.

724
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,510
Look at this.

725
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,240
(The fact that Hsu Tae-lun is cheating
on his girlfriend has been confirmed.)

726
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,640
(Hsu Tae-lun cheats fans with pictures
approving the truth.)

727
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,750
(Scumbag, liar.)

728
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,070
(Buy it, buy it.)

729
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,900
(In your name: Maybe I'm)

730
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,740
(dispensable to you, is that right?)

731
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,720
Who is this "In your name"?

732
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,440
(DQ.Five jungler has been proved
to have slept with his fan.)

733
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,790
(The kitten I bought from the flower
and bird market today.)

734
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,680
(I'm happy.)

735
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,070
(It seems as if there is a bond and a trust.)

736
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,680
Who is this "In your name"?

737
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,640
Could this be the fan
who was "you know" by Hsu Tae-lun?

738
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,310
She even bought him clothes.

739
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,960
How come no fans buy me clothes?

740
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,720
Because you don't have fans.

741
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
But I have you.

742
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,640
(Scumbag.)

743
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,340
- Guo, are you crazy?
- You don't deserve to be a fan of Dragon.

744
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,790
Are you crazy?

745
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,680
Then who is this Guo that gave a Like

746
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,270
to "In your name"?

747
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,240
Idiot.

748
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,350
Who else could it be?

749
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,160
It's surely "In your name" too.

750
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,110
What?

751
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,960
Hsu Tae-lun brags every day
in the live streaming

752
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
about how well

753
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,880
he and his girlfriend Ning Jiaqi get along,

754
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,270
and shows love on Weibo.

755
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,550
I wonder which time

756
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,400
became the last straw that crushed the camel,

757
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,310
with the girl becoming so furious

758
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,160
that she just made a combo move

759
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,920
with a directional blast
and killed him full-blooded.

760
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,070
Nice.

761
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,070
Why are you guys so gossipy?

762
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,790
He also said that other teams

763
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,070
are losers in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

764
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
I feel like I've been alluded.

765
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,200
I beat him up

766
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,550
in a training match last week.

767
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,160
K dominated him in the jungle
and made him tremble.

768
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,400
He now tells me that the other teams

769
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,350
are losers in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League?

770
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,830
I really can't tolerate this.

771
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,680
It's true.

772
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,680
There is a new piece of information.

773
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,790
Go ahead.

774
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,510
I am a staff member of DQ.Five.

775
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,270
All righty.

776
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,350
DQ.Five

777
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,920
is in the charge of South Korean men.

778
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,000
His teammates dare not say no to him.

779
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,960
In fact,

780
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,800
when they played against ZGDX last week,

781
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,920
any fool would know other teammates
couldn't gain the upper hand

782
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,280
if he ganked like that.

783
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,400
But still, he did it.

784
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,030
Why?

785
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,480
Because the one who sleeping-with-fans
hates ZGDX's midsolo

786
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,880
for not helping clear his name

787
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,920
that day about the movie theater thing.

788
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,670
Why does he hate her so much?

789
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,760
It's because the players of their club

790
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,320
are too obedient to him.

791
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,840
He thinks that all Chinese people
are like that.

792
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,360
Once a person finally stood up against him,

793
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
he wasn't used to it.

794
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,230
Let me see.

795
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,110
Arrogant.

796
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,150
We can't just put the stereotype
on all South Koreans.

797
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
There are also good South Korean players
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

798
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,590
Hierophant, Kim Eun-seok.

799
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,960
And Li Hengshuo. They are all good.

800
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,510
This kind of thing

801
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,280
is directly related to
the discipline of the club.

802
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,550
I think whether it's a full Chinese team
or one with Korean supporters,

803
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,760
(Obviously, I'm doing my best.)
you have to follow the rules no matter how capable you're.

804
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,630
(Not as good as she is or is she just destined to be a mistress?)
DQ.Five did play well in the spring playoffs.

805
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,110
(Guo: Scumbag!)
But that was just a flash in the pan.

806
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,880
From the moment
their club started to acquiesce

807
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,630
to Hsu Tae-lun's misbehavior,

808
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,440
it was already screwed.

809
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,230
DQ.Five isn't

810
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,630
the only club

811
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
where the management can't even suppress

812
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,710
the say of the main South Koreans

813
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

814
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,480
If this kind of evil culture is not curbed,

815
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,670
Onmyoji Arena Pro League

816
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,840
will really be screwed.

817
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
It's over.

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,320
It should have been regulated long ago.

819
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,280
If the domestic clubs

820
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,510
can reflect on the problem of Korean aids,

821
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,190
the fact that he was exposed as a scandal

822
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,440
won't necessarily be a bad thing.

823
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,710
This industry should have been
cleaned up long ago.

824
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,920
What a great sense of justice.

825
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,550
After investigating,

826
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,740
player Hsu Tae-lun has committed
serious disciplinary offences.

827
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,180
(244 messages from 4 contacts)

828
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,070
(First, in the match
between DQ.Five and ZGDX,)

829
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,440
(the player was seriously negative
in the game.)

830
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,590
(Second, Hsu Tae-lun
has a disorderly personal life,)

831
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,150
(which has greatly affected
the image of the e-sports industry,)

832
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,070
(causing bad social influence.)

833
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,880
(According to the game rules of)

834
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,800
(the Onmyoji Arena Pro League,)

835
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,670
(the player will be banned for one season,)

836
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,440
(Tae-lun, you must cheer up.)
with a fine of 10,000 yuan.

837
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,550
(At the same time, due to mismanagement,)

838
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,190
(DQ.Five club will be given
a serious warning,)

839
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,070
(with a fine of 100,000 yuan.)

840
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,590
(Congratulations to our DQ.Five
for their victory!)

841
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,480
(Let's invite their captain, Dragon)

842
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,110
(to share his experience in the game.)

843
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,000
It's a great honor

844
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,710
for our team to win this game.

845
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,510
And

846
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,110
I would like to thank not only my teammates,

847
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,920
but also

848
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,880
a special someone.

849
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,320
Because of her,

850
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,400
our team was able to

851
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
gradually grow up.

852
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,480
And I hope that this person can

853
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,630
accompany us all the way.

854
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,000
Well said.

855
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,960
Love you.

856
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,320
Love you.

857
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,920
Nice.

858
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,230
Let's go, guys.

859
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,550
Tonight is on me.

860
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
Let's go, let's go. Great.

861
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,960
- Let's eat.
- Let's go.

862
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,980
(Happy Birthday, Tae-lun.)

863
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,280
Do you like it?

864
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,550
It's good.

865
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,590
Can I take a picture with you?

866
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Let's take it with my phone.

867
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,550
Okay?

868
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,800
Come on.

869
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,230
Okay.

870
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,190
Come on, smile.

871
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,150
Three, two, one.

872
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,440
Okay.

873
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,230
Let me have a look.

874
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,190
I'll send it to you next time.

875
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,840
Well.

876
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,320
I'll blow out the candle?

877
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,150
(Are you okay, Guo?)

878
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,360
(Your blogs have been deleted.)

879
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,710
(Are you going to quit the industry?)

880
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
(I don't understand why you did this.)

881
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,320
(I thought we agreed)

882
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,710
(not to make these things public.)

883
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,840
(Hsu Tae-lun is banned from the game.)

884
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,400
(You're the one who betrayed Hsu Tae-lun.)

885
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,070
(Thanks to you.)

886
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,030
(You betrayed us too.)

887
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,710
(You're really a vicious woman.)

888
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
(Forget it, Guo.)

889
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,280
(If I had known he was like that,)

890
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,880
(I wouldn't even have been his fan.)

891
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,320
(This week is his last game in China.)

892
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,400
(Are you coming or not?)

893
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,030
Stop it.

894
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,960
Miss Tong Yao,

895
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,880
You must have had a hard day.

896
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,440
Thank you.

897
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,670
Everything's ready inside.

898
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,550
This way, please.

899
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,670
The interview hasn't started yet.

900
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,710
Why don't we go inside and sit for a while?

901
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,030
The interview hasn't started yet?

902
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,070
With Hsu Tae-lun's scandal…

903
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,070
So...

904
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,190
I'll go get something to eat.

905
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,960
I'll be back later.

906
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,550
Okay, I'll give you the umbrella.

907
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,840
Okay, thanks.

908
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,060
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

909
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,920
Are you okay?

910
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,670
I was too greedy.

911
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,280
At first, I just wanted to
look at him from afar.

912
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,150
Gradually, I wanted to go out with him.

913
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,960
Then I started to be dissatisfied and picky.

914
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,920
I became irritable, anxious and hysterical

915
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,920
because I couldn't get him.

916
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,510
Did I ruin him?

917
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,550
If you had known,
why would you have done it in the first place?

918
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,320
Cheng.

919
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Why are you here?

920
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,030
The interview was suddenly changed
to a double interview.

921
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,030
So here I am.

922
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,440
What's going on?

923
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,800
Didn't they bring you an umbrella?

924
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,800
Yes, they did.

925
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,670
Something unexpected happened.

926
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,710
I gave my umbrella to someone else.

927
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,960
Where's the interviewer?

928
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,440
Not here yet.

929
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,000
I just saw fans at the gate.

930
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,110
Looking at those fans,

931
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,670
I felt uneasy.

932
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,190
Why do you think they came?

933
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,550
What are they looking for?

934
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,760
The hero in their hearts?

935
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,550
Or their own imaginary persona?

936
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,550
In fact, those people on stage

937
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,030
are not as great as they think they are.

938
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,920
Some of them may even be

939
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,510
worse than themselves.

940
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,840
What's wrong?

941
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,320
I should be asking you this question.

942
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,840
I just saw that girl.

943
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,110
The one who was with Hsu Tae-lun.

944
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I hated her at first.

945
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,920
But now I think

946
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,230
she's also sad being a fan at the same time,

947
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
though she is annoying.

948
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
Fans

949
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,550
always like to think too much of

950
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,800
the people they like,

951
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,510
whether it's Hsu Tae-lun,

952
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,800
or us.

953
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,880
Disregard the feelings of those who like us,

954
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,480
do what we want to, do as we please,

955
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,030
be exposed,

956
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,360
and get destroyed.

957
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,670
When I think about it,

958
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,880
I feel that maybe our industry
doesn't deserve

959
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,510
to be liked by others.

960
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,360
It's not as bad as you think.

961
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,000
At least our teammates

962
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,230
are doing pretty well, right?

963
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,150
They're all at the base all day.

964
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,590
It's almost like the ZGDX base
is a monk's temple.

965
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,840
You can't just overthrow

966
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,550
a bunch of people
for the sake of an individual.

967
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,110
It's not fair.

968
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,510
And I've already reminded you.

969
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,150
I'm a good person.

970
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,670
But the way you think now

971
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,800
makes me feel worried.

972
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,190
Worried?

973
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,550
Before I've had time to confess,

974
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,800
you've already become disillusioned
by this industry.

975
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,150
That's a problem.

976
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,630
There are still many good men

977
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,070
in this industry,

978
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,590
rich and handsome,

979
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,590
who plays games well
and doesn't sleep with fans.

980
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,360
There is also someone
who treats the base as a monk's temple,

981
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,510
and is almost ready to get up
every day to recite the sutra.

982
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,920
Who?

983
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:39,550
Me.

984
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,110
So,

985
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,710
I'll ask you the same question as before.

986
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,920
Do you want to give it a try?

987
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,070
Try what?

988
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,360
Me.
