1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,430
Cheng.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,080
One last question.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,360
Go ahead.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,030
You've been ignoring me
for the past few days.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,270
Is it just because you're angry

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,560
or because of something else?

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,440
Because I was afraid.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,870
I was afraid I'd go soft-hearted.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
(Anyone)

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,280
(will inevitably have to make sacrifices)

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,430
(for the things they love.)

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
(Be prepared.)

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,470
(This is just the beginning.)

14
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,300
=Falling into Your Smile=

15
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,060
=Episode 19=

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,430
(Obsidian has arrived near the monster.)

17
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,040
(There they've found
ZGDX hitting the monster.)

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,070
Cat, hold on!

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
Clear the line.
Clear the line on the top lane.

20
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,790
ZGDX.

21
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,790
Destroy the top turret.

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,920
Go up, go up. Get in there.

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,640
Controlled.

24
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,640
Hold on, hold on.

25
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,870
(ZGDX gets the monster)

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
(Killed Off the Monster)
(And have taken advantage of it.)

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,520
Nice!

28
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,860
(Defeat)

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
(The team fight isn't over yet.)

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,220
(Double Kill)

31
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,000
(Okay, ZGDX)

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
(has taken the victory in the team fight.)

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,280
Lu Yue, go.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,240
(Defeat)
Coming.

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,380
(Rampage)

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,360
(Obsidian is unstoppable.)

37
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,400
(Defeat)

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
(ZGDX continues to chase after them.)

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
(Defeat)

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,520
(Another kill.)

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,120
Nice!

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,280
The last team fight.

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,360
- Here we go.
- Copy that.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,080
Go, go, go.

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,400
Fight! Fight! Fight!

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
(Perfect Power)

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,960
Watch out, watch out!

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
There's another one behind us. Hurry.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,470
Chase.

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,500
Spread out.

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,000
(God's Envoy)

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,910
Give me room for my attack damage.

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,400
Chase! Chase!

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,240
(Unstoppable)
(Chessman continues to chase after them.)

55
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,030
(Nice! He killed another one.)

56
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,800
(Chessman completes a double kill)

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,000
(God's Envoy)
He's still chasing.

58
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,520
(Triple Kill)

59
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,590
(Nice! Chessman has got a Triple Kill.)

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
(This looks like
a good chance to win the fight.)

61
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,150
Nice!

62
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,120
(Let's congratulate ZGDX)

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,080
(for winning the game.)

64
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,120
(Let's congratulate ZGDX.)

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,430
(Thanks to NongFu Spring)

66
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,870
(for your support of this season!)

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,910
(Let's get back to the point.)

68
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,630
(ZGDX's performance in this game)

69
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,560
(was really surprising.)

70
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,590
(Especially when it came to player Lv)

71
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,030
(who did a good job too during the match.)

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
(He got the MVP.)

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,430
(To be honest,)

74
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,910
(when even a substitute can play so well,)

75
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,240
(I think maybe the other teams)

76
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,430
(need to reevaluate)

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
(ZGDX's overall strength.)

78
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,960
(That's right.)

79
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
(What's Lu Yue's treat for dinner tonight?)

80
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm telling you, Lu Yue.

81
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,360
You can eat whatever you want tonight.

82
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,310
Good for you.

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,360
Yes!

84
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,310
Awesome.

85
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,120
Lu Yue.

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,150
You played well.

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
MVP.

88
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,800
It feels like after this game,

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,470
you'll gain 300,000 more fans.

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,680
What did you say?

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,470
What did the water dispenser do to you

92
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,910
or are you planning to retire?

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,360
Cheng, what did you say to Shorty?

94
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,240
She seems to

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,680
have had some kind of breakdown.

96
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,840
It's delicious. Let's go eat that.

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,430
All you care about is eating.

98
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,960
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

99
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,360
After this game,

100
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,630
our team still holds the record
for winning every single match.

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,310
Did you see the fans in the audience?

102
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,510
The glow sticks they waved for your victory

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,070
were all based on my previous performance.

104
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes, your brilliant performance.

105
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,950
And then you slapped it away

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,160
with a loss of 120,000 yuan.

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,830
I'm praising you.

108
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
Do you know how to be grateful?

109
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,270
What a mean guy.

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
That was a good game.

111
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,310
Very good.

112
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Am I right?

113
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,390
Why do you two have so much to say?

114
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,270
What time will they be out?

115
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,070
Who knows?

116
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
- Just wait for them.
- We've been waiting for so long.

117
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,560
They're coming out.

118
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,720
Coming. Come on, come on.

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:04,950
Hello.

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,560
Thank you. Thank you.

121
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Let me get by. Let us get by.

122
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,630
Excuse me. Excuse me.

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,600
Look over here. Look over here.

124
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,560
Please look over here.

125
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,310
It's quite crowded.

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,430
Hello. Hello.

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Tong Yao.

128
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,800
May I ask you a question?

129
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,560
What do you think about this ban?

130
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,240
I deserved it.

131
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,560
Do you feel particularly aggrieved?

132
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,800
Rumor has it that you did it

133
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
to protect your teammates.

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,390
I'm not aggrieved.

135
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,430
Are you worried
that you'll be replaced by Lu Yue?

136
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm only banned for one game.

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,830
Why did you hit her?

138
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,510
Didn't you know

139
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,160
it would stain your image?

140
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,870
Or did you know

141
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,510
every move you made
would be noticed by the public,

142
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,120
being the only female competitor.

143
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,830
So you couldn't help but do this

144
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,750
so as to gain attention.

145
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,750
That's pretty much of it.

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,480
How do you expect her
to respond to these questions?

147
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,430
Which media are you in?

148
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,830
That's exactly the way it is.

149
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,950
She became the starting player
without any practical training.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,430
I heard that she signed a contract before.

151
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,950
Yes, even if she is really good,

152
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,360
she didn't turn on the camera
during her previous live streaming.

153
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,920
Who knows if she played by herself or not?

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,360
The club signed the contract
with her just like that.

155
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,510
According to Article 246

156
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,750
of the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China,

157
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,160
whoever publicly insults others
by violence or other methods

158
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,040
or fabricates facts to slander others,

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
if the circumstances are serious,

160
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,390
shall be sentenced to the fixed-term imprisonment
of no more than three years,

161
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,630
detention, control,

162
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,750
as well as deprivation of political rights.

163
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,680
So,

164
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,240
think twice before you say anything.

165
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,310
Don't go.

166
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,390
That's right.

167
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,240
Is what Cheng said true?

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you think my brother studied
at the University of Political Science and Law for nothing?

169
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,160
(Lv.)

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,360
(How does it feel to be back
after such a long time?)

171
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,070
It feels pretty good.

172
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,430
That's why I picked
my newly trained shikigami today.

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,310
(Yes, Lv picked Enenra)

174
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,160
who doesn't really

175
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,630
match his style of play today.

176
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,040
It's a surprise.

177
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Did you get prepared in advance?

178
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,160
I don't think it was prepared in advance.

179
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,430
It's just our coach.

180
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,830
Yes, our coach, Ming.

181
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
He said that a Chinese midsolo
must be able to command this shikigami.

182
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,830
It's a bit embarrassing if not.

183
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,390
So I practiced her in advance.

184
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,190
So Smiling can play Enenra too?

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,630
She's very good at Enenra.

186
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
In fact, I think she's good at
every shikigami.

187
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
At first, she didn't play well with Higanbana.

188
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,480
But later on,
she also gained good command of her.

189
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
It seems that the relationship

190
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,190
between the starting player
and the substitute of ZGDX

191
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,190
is not so tense.

192
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,390
There's nothing to be tense about.

193
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,600
We have different styles

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,480
and different patterns of play.

195
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,560
Whoever should go play in the game
will go play.

196
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,920
But as things stand right now,

197
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,870
she's more suitable than me
to be the starting player.

198
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,800
But I will become stronger afterwards.

199
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,800
That's for sure.

200
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,480
It seems that Lv is responding to

201
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,750
some of the doubts
about ZGDX on the internet.

202
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,000
I trust the judgment of my teammates.

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,310
If there is something I want,

204
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll go for it myself.

205
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,680
So you do have a conscience.

206
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,190
You actually knew how to compliment me.

207
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't take it the wrong way.

208
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,070
I was defending my brother's team.

209
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,870
That's all.

210
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,360
Brother protector.

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Come inside, please.

212
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,830
This restaurant is so good.

213
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,120
What's wrong? You've got a limp?

214
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,190
It's a scrape.

215
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,190
Be careful.

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,390
Wait for me.

217
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,630
You didn't even tell me
your feet were scraped out.

218
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,390
Are you mute?

219
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,310
I'll go to the store to buy a band-aid.
It'll be fine.

220
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,120
Come on, Dragon.

221
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,240
Let's take a picture.

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,800
Okay.

223
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,070
Me too. Me too.

224
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,020
- Come on, look at me, let's take a picture.
- Come on, cheers.

225
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,560
Okay.

226
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,190
See how good this filter looks?

227
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,430
Don't move. One more picture.

228
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,190
This little brat
is always surrounded by women.

229
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,390
Tong Yao?

230
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,310
What do you think?

231
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,480
Look at it. Does it look good?

232
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,480
This one's not bad.

233
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,950
Why are you here too?

234
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,190
I came to eat.

235
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,360
I was live yesterday.

236
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Someone in the live room
said bad things about you.

237
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,550
I cursed them.

238
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,510
I told them not to say that about you.

239
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,630
You're very nice.

240
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,390
Thank you.

241
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,510
But don't do that next time.

242
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,240
They will scold you too.

243
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,600
I'll get you into trouble.

244
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,030
Get me into trouble?

245
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,360
I don't understand.

246
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,720
Cheng, what does it mean?

247
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,910
You're childish.

248
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,150
Yao, you're so cute.

249
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,510
You're so cute even when
you're cursing someone.

250
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,240
Today, I told Tae-lun,

251
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,480
you're funny.

252
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,480
Tae-lun said he thinks you're funny too.

253
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,630
Hello.

254
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,460
(Jungle player, ID: DQ.Five_Dragon)

255
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,540
(Hsu Tae-lun, Jungler)

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,030
Come on.

257
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,510
I said no.

258
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,630
This is the girl of another brother.

259
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,670
And even if she's technically not,

260
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,150
I still rank second.

261
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,750
Daydreaming.

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,390
What does "daydreaming" mean?

263
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,510
The same as before.

264
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,720
Cheng.

265
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,480
You are not cute at all when cursing others.

266
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
Yao.

267
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm going to eat first.

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,670
I'll contact you later by WeChat.

269
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
Watch your feet.

270
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,320
That Tae-lun he…

271
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,550
What Tae-lun?

272
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,670
Do you know him well?

273
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,200
He looks familiar.

274
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,630
Another jungler!

275
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,200
Tong Yao, what's wrong with you?

276
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,720
I always feel like I've seen

277
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,550
this Tae-lun somewhere before.

278
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,120
We've seen

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,910
DQ.Five's game videos before.

280
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,720
No.

281
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,630
It was in some other place.

282
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,200
Don't think about it, just eat it.

283
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,030
Have one.

284
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,630
I remember now.

285
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,670
What's wrong?

286
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,670
I've seen Tae-lun somewhere before.

287
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,120
I saw him on Ning Jiaqi's live stream.

288
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,150
What's their relationship?

289
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

290
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,790
You don't know?

291
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,790
Shorty.

292
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,000
Eat the meat.

293
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,600
Grow taller.

294
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,480
Excuse me, pull over along the street ahead.

295
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,600
Cheng, what are you doing?

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,750
Going to buy something.

297
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,870
You don't have to wait for me.

298
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,080
Biscuit.

299
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,720
Let's go eat.

300
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,150
Let's go. Let's eat.

301
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,150
Bye-bye.

302
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,670
What?

303
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,480
Tong Yao, come on.

304
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,080
This.

305
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,840
What's wrong?

306
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,720
This…

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,390
Why are there only

308
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
two of Cheng's goldfish sons left?

309
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,150
There were three before we left
for the afternoon match.

310
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,240
You must have made a mistake.

311
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,550
No way, check it out for yourself.

312
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Biscuit!

313
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,060
(Cheng 2020.01.25 - 2020.08.12)

314
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Hurry up and figure out a way.

315
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,360
Otherwise, when Cheng comes back,

316
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,840
you and Biscuit will both be killed.

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,510
You see?

318
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,910
How about this?

319
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
Do you think Cheng is stupid?

320
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,030
He may not even see it.

321
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
The colors are different.

322
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,910
What are you doing?

323
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,390
Cheng, your son ate randomly,

324
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,240
and ate himself to death.

325
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,390
I'll help you destroy the body.

326
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,080
I thought it over that

327
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,600
I haven't thanked you
for educating me before.

328
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
What you taught me was so meaningful.

329
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,670
It was as if I got a new set of parents.

330
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,320
You're so kind-hearted,

331
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,600
like a bodhisattva.

332
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,600
You're full of love for all living things.

333
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,270
You abide by the laws
of cause and effect in nature,

334
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,000
and the laws of the food chain
pertaining to the weak and the strong.

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,840
Tong Yao.

336
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Say something I can understand.

337
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,870
My cat

338
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
ate your fish in accordance with

339
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,390
the laws of jungle found in nature.

340
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,510
I screwed up.

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,750
Be optimistic.

342
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,720
Think about it this way.

343
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,080
Maybe it's your goldfish son

344
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,390
grew wings and flew away.

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,960
There is a fish in the north,
and its name is Kun.

346
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,360
The Kun is too big to be stewed in one pot.

347
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,670
Band-Aid.

348
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,740
(Jinyang)

349
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,750
Hey, Jinyang.

350
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,080
You're in such a good mood!

351
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
Of course, I am.

352
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,240
It's a beautiful day.

353
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,150
So of course I'm happy.

354
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,630
Is it?

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,630
It's a cloudy one for your captain.

356
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,440
What do you mean?

357
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,670
Your captain

358
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,510
isn't playing the game
as he should be in the live room.

359
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,630
He's searching for a live baby piranha.

360
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,720
Ai Jia just transferred the link to me.

361
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,440
I'll send it to you.

362
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm hanging up.

363
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,600
I won't keep you from
enjoying your captain's heroics.

364
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,600
(Cheng, you can't buy a baby piranha.)

365
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,670
(Search for something else.)

366
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,440
I don't know why,

367
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,150
all the search results are Venus-Flytraps.

368
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,510
But thinking about it.
The effect would be about the same

369
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,720
if I were to put one next to the fish tank.

370
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,630
So I bought one.

371
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,200
(Cheng, what's the effect?)

372
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,320
Anyone who tries to
tease the fish again will be bitten.

373
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,790
(A Venus-Flytrap?)

374
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,390
(No way!)

375
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,910
(It's not going to eat my Biscuit, is it?)

376
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,840
(Biscuit, I'm sorry.)

377
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,630
Biscuit!

378
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,790
Biscuit?

379
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,630
Biscuit!

380
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,630
Biscuit.

381
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,960
Biscuit.

382
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,920
Biscuit.

383
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,510
Don't move.

384
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,550
Otherwise, get lost.

385
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,920
Lu Sicheng, I'm not…

386
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,830
Let go of me!

387
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,790
You...

388
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,830
Cheng, why are you still awake?

389
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,790
I...

390
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
I must be sleepwalking.

391
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,240
(Oh my God.)

392
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,310
(What did I just see?)

393
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,680
(I'm going to go blind.)

394
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,750
(I didn't know
you were that kind of captain.)

395
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,750
(It's my fault for being so naïve.)

396
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,640
(Why did I have to see that?)

397
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,830
(Why did I have to see that again?)

398
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
(There are 365 days a year.)

399
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,110
(I only get up early
for no more than five days a year.)

400
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,510
(Why did you choose these days)

401
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,350
(to blind my eyes?)

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,070
(Or do you two actually…)

403
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,240
(I want to call the police.)

404
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,920
What's up?

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,880
Why do you look like you're in shock?

406
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,310
What are you doing?

407
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,680
Getting so close to me while I'm sleeping.

408
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,920
I came down from upstairs.

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,720
I wanted to see if my cat is still alive.

410
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,350
How can a good healthy cat just die?

411
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
If you want to make an excuse,
please think up a new one.

412
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,110
It's all because you said
you wanted to buy that flytrap yesterday.

413
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
I just wanted to see if my cat is alive,

414
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,790
or if you strangled her

415
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,270
and flushed her down the toilet.

416
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,440
But then

417
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,830
I came down to find you asleep in the game.

418
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,790
Then out of kindness,

419
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,830
I was afraid you would be cold

420
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,440
so I found you a blanket.

421
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,480
But you just pressed my head

422
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,160
against your stomach for no reason,

423
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
and messed up my hair.

424
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,750
How is that possible?

425
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,240
You thought I was Biscuit?

426
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,920
How… How could…

427
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,830
Anyway, the final scene was seen by Chubby.

428
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,500
(Calling "Roly Poly")

429
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,240
Hey, Chubby, you got it wrong.

430
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
We didn't do anything.

431
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
If we were about to do anything,

432
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,920
why would it be in the living room?

433
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,440
You're a fool. I'm not.

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
If you didn't sound so aggressive,

435
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,590
you'd have been a little more convincing.

436
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,960
Now even I think
you're just throwing us for a loop.

437
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,590
So what do you think

438
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,270
Chubby thought we were doing?

439
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,200
Cheng.

440
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,590
Today is Tuesday.

441
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,440
There is no training match.

442
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,310
I thought since
we have nothing to do today anyway,

443
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,270
then why don't we go to the flower,
bird and fish market?

444
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,480
I'll get you another goldfish.

445
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,590
But you stayed up all night

446
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,830
playing games.

447
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,270
So I guess it's better to just forget it.

448
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,440
Okay.

449
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,110
Let me take a shower and change my clothes.

450
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,640
Please wash your hair too.

451
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's go.

452
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,200
Okay.

453
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,720
Chubby.

454
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,350
You haven't reached
your live performance goal, right?

455
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,400
I have.

456
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,590
That can't be true.

457
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,720
I think you've reached
your eating performance goal.

458
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,960
If you do this again,
your salary will be deducted.

459
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,070
What's going on?

460
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,270
Tong Yao looks especially alluring today.

461
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,640
Excuse me?

462
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,750
Why do they have to
choose the same brand of shoes?

463
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,400
What's the situation?

464
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,400
What do you mean "what's the situation"?

465
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,640
Where are our two carry players going?

466
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
They said they were going to
the flower, bird and fish market to buy fish.

467
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,590
Going to the flower, bird
and fish market to buy a fish.

468
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,920
Is it the flower, bird and fish market
next to the Civil Affairs Bureau,

469
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,790
or is it the Civil Affairs Bureau
next to the flower, bird and fish market?

470
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,030
Spring is here.

471
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,750
It's the time of the year
when the animals are in heat.

472
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,920
These two people are too blatant, right?

473
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,920
Although it's not prohibited in the club,

474
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
this is…

475
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,830
I suddenly feel very angry.

476
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
These days dysgnosia people
and elementary school students

477
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,070
can go on a date.

478
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,960
While our Cat,

479
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,830
as such a normal person is single.

480
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
All he can do is to
grab iron shafts all by himself.

481
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,110
Strong.

482
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,980
(Dutch Flower Town)

483
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,310
Cheng.

484
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,830
What?

485
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,510
You look good in a necklace.

486
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,750
Why don't you wear it at the base?

487
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,960
For whom would I wear it at the base?

488
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,350
Who are you wearing it for now?

489
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,240
The fish?

490
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,590
Aren't you wearing a dress too?

491
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,640
Who are you wearing it for?

492
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,480
The cats?

493
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,790
Have you stared it long enough?

494
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,270
Shorty.

495
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,270
Are you an adult or not?

496
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,720
Why?

497
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,720
You don't even know how to wear high heels.

498
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,030
Why are you pretending to be an adult?

499
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,590
Cheng, how many do you want?

500
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,030
Whatever.

501
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,440
What color do you want?

502
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Black.

503
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,750
The red ones are so pretty.

504
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,030
Look at their tails,
they're like little umbrellas.

505
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,440
Is that so?

506
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,440
I want a black one.

507
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,640
Red is so festive.

508
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,720
Look how it's bouncing around.

509
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,000
It looks like it's going to live a long life.

510
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,920
If my fish

511
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,510
wasn't bitten to death by your cat,

512
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,720
it would also have lived a long life.

513
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,270
I told you I wanted the black one.

514
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,030
You can't judge me.

515
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,310
I'm in charge of my own fish tank.

516
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,590
Since you don't like red so much,

517
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,160
don't take the Fire Kirin anymore.

518
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,070
Give it to me.

519
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,680
Don't you dare touch my Fire Kirin.

520
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,160
If you are so capable,

521
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,110
why don't you let the game designer

522
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,920
design a Black Kirin for you?

523
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,920
Just say you like it.

524
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
"No rebuttal accepted.

525
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,070
I'm in charge of my own jungle.

526
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,880
That's how dominant I am."

527
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,070
You're way too talkative.

528
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
Handsome.

529
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,240
I suggest you just listen to the girl.

530
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,030
What's the point
of fighting with your girlfriend?

531
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,000
If they get angry,

532
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,960
we are the ones who suffer in the end, right?

533
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,720
Next month when you want to hold her hand

534
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,680
and she slaps it away,

535
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,200
then brings this up with you,

536
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,550
that's when you'll regret it.

537
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,640
Sir.

538
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,590
You've got it all wrong.

539
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,640
We are not in that kind of relationship.

540
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
How much is this fish?

541
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,310
One yuan and a half.

542
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,640
One yuan, is that okay?

543
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,790
Hello?

544
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,790
You drive an Aston Martin

545
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,750
and now you're bargain with
a stall owner for 50 cents?

546
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,750
Are you even human?

547
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,310
My wife is the same as your girlfriend.

548
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,510
Willful.

549
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,640
We're really not…

550
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,110
Pay up.

551
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,070
Here is the fish.

552
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,830
Thank you.

553
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,960
Here you go.

554
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,750
Take care.

555
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,590
What are you looking at?

556
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,880
Let's go.

557
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,240
This place will cost me three years of my life
every time I come here.

558
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,720
If you want me to die early,

559
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,200
let your cat eat my fish again.

560
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,000
Shorty.

561
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,270
You're always taking advantage of me today.

562
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,400
It's not appropriate, is it?

563
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,550
So cute.

564
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,880
Ma'am, how much is it?

565
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,110
3,500 yuan for this cat.

566
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,110
Are you kidding me?

567
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,790
It's not enough for you
to have the one fat cat?

568
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,680
You still want another one?

569
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,270
What a cute kitten!

570
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,110
Hello.

571
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,830
Dragon, give me this.

572
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,400
I want this kitten.

573
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,400
It can keep me company when you're not there.

574
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,720
I saw this first.

575
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,550
Let's go.

576
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,830
Okay.

577
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,550
Is he Chessman?

578
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,240
Ma'am, how much is it?

579
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,160
I saw the cat first.

580
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,750
It's enough that you have that one fat cat.

581
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,680
You still want to get another one?

582
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,070
There are already
two annoying little creatures at the base.

583
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,110
I reject keeping a third one.

584
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,310
How come there are two?

585
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,270
You and the cat.

586
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,270
That cat was so cute.

587
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,030
It's like the brother of Biscuit.

588
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,000
Wait a minute.

589
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,590
Isn't his girlfriend Ning Jiaqi?

590
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,270
Then that one just now is…

591
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Maybe she's a fan of DQ.Five

592
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,920
or maybe she's a staff member.

593
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,880
What the hell?

594
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,070
He's cheating?

595
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,110
I feel embarrassed for you.

596
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,030
First Li Hengshuo and then Hsu Tae-lun.

597
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,590
You're never able to see through people.

598
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Keep your mouth shut from now on.

599
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,680
You didn't tell me before.

600
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,160
Would you believe me if I did?

601
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,070
You'd say I made
an unfounded attack upon them

602
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,110
out of envy and jealousy.

603
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,000
The car is here.

604
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,440
Please.

605
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,310
I'm a little hungry.
What would you like to eat?

606
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,280
Noodles.

607
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,350
Noodles?

608
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,910
I thought girls all favored

609
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,960
Japanese food or something like that.

610
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,830
Girls?

611
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,110
What're those?

612
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,590
I want to eat the noodles

613
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,350
with hot soup, meat and eggs.

614
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,000
If there is someone of a certain gender
who loves noodles,

615
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,590
I must be of the same gender with him.

616
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,070
Mr. Li, sorry.

617
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
I'll have to change the destination.

618
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,520
Okay, received.

619
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,310
Please follow the navigation
to the destination.

620
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,800
What do you want to do later?

621
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,110
Go back to the base for gaming.

622
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,680
There is no training match today.

623
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,800
I don't want to play games.

624
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,390
Why don't we go to the movies?

625
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,910
I've already bought the tickets.

626
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,200
You'll go with me.

627
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,280
Let's go.

628
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,720
What are you doing?

630
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,800
You're acting like a thief.

631
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,440
If I get caught, then...

632
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,760
You've already played
a third of the tournament's finalists.

633
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,110
You're still not used to the fact that

634
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,480
you have to show up in public a lot
being a public figure?

635
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,680
The first time I asked you to hide behind me

636
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,150
was because you just joined the team.

637
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,680
The second time, you won't be so lucky.

638
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,720
Why?

639
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,000
You have to learn to adapt yourself to it.

640
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,110
This is the most basic requirement.

641
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,680
Adapt to being a public figure first,

642
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,870
then adapt to not being manipulated
by public opinions.

643
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,200
Isn't your education policy

644
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,590
to be well behaved and cause less trouble?

645
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,280
That's what you taught me before.

646
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,550
Even if you make it,

647
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,870
there will still always be
someone discussing you.

648
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,830
Yesterday, someone said you've gained weight
during the live stream.

649
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,590
Really?

650
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,590
See, you're being manipulated
by public opinion again.

651
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,800
Can't you get on the scale yourself?

652
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,590
When you're able to

653
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,070
you're not fat and it's just they're blind,

654
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,310
that means you've graduated.

655
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,680
How come it's so tiring
being a professional player?

656
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,000
If you want to wear a crown,
you have to bear its weight.

657
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,590
You brought the kitten in?

658
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,720
It's cold in here.

659
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,910
Kittens get sick easily.

660
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,550
If they get sick,

661
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,110
there will be a lot of trouble
to take care of them.

662
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,070
Enjoy the movie.

663
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,070
Hsu Tae-lun is so cunning.

664
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,440
He ran away before the movie was finished.

665
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,870
There seems to be fans there.

666
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
I have to go to the bathroom.

667
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,800
You really haven't grown up.

668
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,110
Hsu Tae-lun must have known there were fans,

669
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,070
setting you up on purpose.

670
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,960
I'll hide first.

671
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,350
I told you this wouldn't happen again.

672
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,630
Cheng, are you dating with Smiling?

673
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,630
Why is she here?

674
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
Or is your whole team there?

675
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Why is she hiding?

676
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,240
Is she shy?

677
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,760
Oh my God, you're not really dating, are you?

678
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,200
I didn't believe
what was on the Internet at first.

679
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,800
I thought so too.

680
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,310
Hello, everyone.

681
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,070
I'm ZGDX's midsolo, Smiling.

682
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,240
Her standard lines when receiving

683
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
MVP interviews.

684
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,200
Don't laugh.

685
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,910
She gets shy easily.

686
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,280
I had a hard time convincing her
to watch the movie with me.

687
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,070
Cheng, are you two together alone?

688
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,350
Yes.

689
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,910
I think it's definitely…

690
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,350
I've seen people talking about you two

691
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,960
all the time on the E-sports Industry Farm.

692
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
So you two are really together?

693
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,390
We are…

694
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,000
We are harmonious teammates.

695
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,800
It's just a coincidence
that we went out to see a movie together.

696
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,760
Teammates.

697
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,640
What did you do today?

698
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,720
We bought the fish.

699
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,200
Bought fish for a whole day?

700
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,910
Do you really think I'm stupid?

701
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,990
Oh, right.

702
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,640
We did go to a movie.

703
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,200
It's Black Widow, the one you like.

704
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,600
Spoiler alert?

705
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,390
No.

706
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,510
Come on.

707
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,240
No, no.

708
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,870
Don't spoil my Scarlett Johansson.

709
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,470
Kitten?

710
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,800
Yeah, from a fan.

711
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,030
It's so cute.

712
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,760
(DQ.Five_Dragon)
Thank you.

713
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,680
(So cute. A warm guy.)
I'll take good care of it.

714
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,240
Cinema?

715
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,030
Watching a movie?

716
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,800
You must have mistaken someone else for me.

717
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,540
(Just returned to the base?)
I just returned to the base with the kitten.

718
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,640
(It doesn't seem to be true.)
I just returned to the base with the kitten.

719
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,700
(I feel like it's not the truth.)
I've been playing games

720
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,280
with another account this afternoon.

721
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,500
(Ask your teammates if this is the case.)
If you don't believe me,

722
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,510
ask my teammates.

723
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,860
(Dragon, be composed,
continue to make up lies.)

724
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,960
(I saw him at the cinema today
and he said he didn't go there.)

725
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,160
(Lying)

726
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,830
(The teammates are also telling lies.)
Yes.

727
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,860
(I saw him too)
He's been playing games

728
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,470
at the base this afternoon.

729
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,870
(You're lying.
I don't believe you're telling the truth.)

730
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,670
(Your teammates are lying too.)

731
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,470
(Are you going to
keep lying to us like this?)

732
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,430
Besides, the cinema is so cold.

733
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,600
The kitten would definitely catch a cold
if it was there.

734
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,310
(Whoever has a kitten must be kind.)
I can't do that.

735
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
Civet Cat.

736
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,600
Go and turn off the air conditioning
in the base.

737
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,120
The kitten will catch a cold
if it is blown with too much cold air.

738
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:17,990
It's okay.

739
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,720
He probably feels a little cold

740
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,950
for being exposed to too much cold air.

741
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,160
Isn't this Hsu Tae-lun from DQ.Five?

742
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,080
Why are you watching his live stream?

743
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,830
Aren't we playing with them next week?

744
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,720
I'm getting to know
the opponent's tactics in advance.

745
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,640
What's wrong?

746
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,350
This Hsu Tae-lun is really annoying.

747
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,310
He's not a good guy.

748
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,310
I hate him.

749
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,310
You guys who play e-sports

750
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,760
are all bad.

751
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,240
Are you out of your mind?

752
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,310
What does it have to do with me?

753
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,030
(Douban Group)

754
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,640
(Jungler Dragon from DQ.Five)

755
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,310
(dated with a woman
other than his girlfriend.)

756
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
(Dragon wasn't wearing the same clothes)

757
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,870
(as in the photo at all.)

758
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,120
(So the person who was caught
on camera this morning)

759
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,430
(is definitely not Hsu Tae-lun.)

760
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,180
(ZGDX_Smiling)
2 p.m. at Wantai Cinema.

761
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
- I ran into Smiling and Chessman.
- What were these two doing alone?

762
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,440
- Isn't that right when…
- The photo of his back.

763
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,780
- The one who saw Hsu Tae-lun.
- The photo is also…

764
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,800
- Wantai Cinema.
- Went to that movie.

765
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,760
(the time of the electronic clock on the wall
can also testify that.)

766
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,680
Cheng and I went to buy goldfish.

767
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,680
We went to see a movie after that
since there was plenty free time.

768
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,910
No one has made a rule that

769
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,640
only couples can go to the movies.

770
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,560
If there was really something
going on between us,

771
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,990
who would so openly

772
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,870
go to the cinema
and wait to be gossiped about by you?

773
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,120
As for the other team's jungler
you were talking about,

774
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,510
I don't know anything about that.

775
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,280
After all, there were
so many people in the cinema.

776
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,120
But

777
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,990
there were indeed a few people

778
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
who came in the dark

779
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,680
after the movie had started.

780
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,640
As for who they were,

781
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,350
why don't you ask him yourself
if you're so curious?

782
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,310
(Smiling is good at being sarcastic.)

783
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,310
(Obviously she's implying Dragon.)

784
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,990
(I bet she and Cheng must have an affair.)

785
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,990
(She's using Tae-lun
to draw attention away from herself.)

786
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,470
(Group Match of Group A, The Third Game
ZGDX vs. DQ.FIVE)

787
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,430
(Dear users of Onmyoji Arena,)

788
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,760
(and those of you
who are watching the live stream.)

789
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,760
(Hello, everyone!)

790
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,950
(Welcome to the scene of)

791
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,680
(the Onmyoji Arena Pro League, 2020.)

792
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,310
(I'm the host, Xizhe.)

793
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,910
(Today's teams are)

794
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,950
(ZGDX and DQ.Five.)

795
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,600
(We can say)

796
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,830
(they're equally strong.)

797
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,200
(Who will be the winner?)

798
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,830
Let's wait and see.

799
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,910
(Once again let's welcome them)

800
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,390
(with a warm applause.)

801
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,510
(All right, please take your seats.)

802
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,720
Let's be careful in this match.

803
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,560
I just feel a little bit nervous.

804
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,720
I don't know why.

805
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,390
You're nervous when looking at anyone.

806
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,560
Is your Zodiac a rabbit?

807
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,260
(ZGDX vs. DQ.FIVE)

808
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
(Well, the lineups of both sides
have been determined.)

809
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,510
(Let's look forward to the following match.)

810
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,510
(The game has just started.)

811
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,120
What are they doing?

812
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,910
Where are they?

813
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,760
I don't know.

814
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,830
Probably in a meeting somewhere.

815
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,080
Come on, let's get ready to kill Tong Yao.

816
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,950
- I know.
- Coming.

817
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,160
(They're about to start a fight)

818
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,640
(while Smiling is still
unaware of it at this time.)

819
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,510
Go. Now.

820
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,280
(Suddenly, they've come to the middle lane
to attack Smiling altogether.)

821
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,160
(Smiling can't fight back at all.)

822
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,910
(Her teammates can't make it to support her.)

823
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,800
(First Blood)
Smiling was killed in seconds.

824
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,030
(- First Blood.)
(- DQ.Five took the first blood.)

825
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,640
Tong Yao, you poor thing.

826
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,870
These five people picked a team fight
in the middle lane right at the beginning.

827
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,200
What was that about?

828
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,720
(They have contained the middle lane
in the early stage.)

829
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,350
