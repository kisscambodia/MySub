1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,390
Want to try it?

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,520
Try what?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,830
Me.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,830
Do you want to try it too, Cheng?

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,910
I already have someone I like.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,220
(My mind has collapsed!!!)

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,840
What?

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,070
You're coming to Shenzhen?

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,920
What are you going to do in Shenzhen?

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,110
Don't scare her.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,790
Five million yuan.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,940
(Check: five million yuan)

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,430
Leave my son.

14
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,580
=Falling into Your Smile=

15
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,340
=Episode 25=

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,430
That's it.

17
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,200
You guys walk out first.

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,950
Okay.

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,680
Okay, okay, okay.

20
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,950
Come on, Mr. Li.

21
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,870
You two wait a minute.

22
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,030
Sit down.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,630
There are no other people here.

24
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,150
You let me know the fact you're in a relationship

25
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,710
from the Internet.

26
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,400
Do you think that's appropriate?

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,630
Mom.

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,560
I've told you many times.

29
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,560
You don't have to come over.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,630
I don't have to.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
If I don't come over,

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,910
are you going to make all your life decisions

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,430
on your own?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,910
You didn't even ask me
or your father about it.

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,310
I've been an adult for a long time.

36
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,400
So what?

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,120
You're still my son.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,680
Besides,

39
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,960
I can't even see you
since you have a girlfriend?

40
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,680
Tong Yao.

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,630
Do you think it's appropriate for him to do so?

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Mom.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,710
I like her.

44
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,910
No one can change this.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Yeah, right.

46
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,190
It's really your own business

47
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,280
to decide who you like

48
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,240
and who you want to be with.

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,470
You don't need to consult us for suggestions.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,750
But

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,870
I've seen this situation on the Internet.

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,680
It's bound to be a bumpy road

53
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,080
ahead for you two.

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,520
Mom, don't worry.

55
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,840
No matter what happens in the future,

56
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,750
I will face it together with her.

57
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,800
(ZGDX Announcement.)

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,710
(ZGDX e-Sports Club Members)

59
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,120
(Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao,)

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
(are currently in a relationship.)

61
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,190
(Thank you all for your longtime attention)

62
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,840
(and support to both players and ZGDX.)

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
(The club adheres to the principles
of free and open management.)

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,310
When did they get together?

65
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,630
(With ensuring the team's training)

66
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,520
(and game results as the premise,)

67
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,680
(the club won't interfere too much with)

68
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,920
(the personal relationships between members.)

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,000
(The club staff)

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,360
(has sent their best wishes)

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
(about the romance between the two members.)

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,360
(As for the alleged infringement of)

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,830
(Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao's
reputation rights on the internet,)

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,040
(the club will continue to pay attention to it)

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,390
(and reserve the right to pursue
the legal responsibility of the publishers)

76
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,000
(and those who reproduce them.)

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
(In response to some of
the allegedly verbal infringing of)

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,190
(their personal safety,)

79
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,070
(the club will take all)

80
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,270
(necessary legal means)

81
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,800
(to pursue the legal responsibility
of the publishers.)

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,920
(We will not tolerate.)

83
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,390
(Once again, we thank all the media and fans)

84
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,950
(for your concern,
tolerance and love of all time.)

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,830
(On behalf of Mr. Lu Sicheng)

86
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,800
(and Ms. Tong Yao,)

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,040
(we would like to express our deepest apologies)

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
(for the waste of social resources)

89
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
(caused by the private issue before.)

90
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,430
(We would also like to call on everyone
to take advantage of this and work together)

91
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,680
(to build a good online environment.)

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,120
Seriously,

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,000
our official blogger is really cool.

94
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,800
She almost wishes you
two a hundred years of happiness

95
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,680
and a baby soon.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
You two.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,430
Aren't you going to quit sugar?

98
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,800
No, I'm upset.

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,720
What are you upset about?

100
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,480
I've done something wrong.

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm afraid that I was too impulsive this time.

102
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,360
I didn't think about the consequences.

103
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,560
What consequences?

104
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,510
About

105
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,270
what you have to face.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
If you are afraid

107
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,560
I'll be beaten down
by all that talk on the Internet,

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
you don't have to.

109
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm fine.

110
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,680
Actually, I was a little scared at first.

111
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,510
I always felt that if we made it public,

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,120
there would be a lot of
opposition and questioning.

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,510
So I worried a lot.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
But I was more afraid that it'd affect you.

115
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,310
Just like Jian Yang did before.

116
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,120
You'd begin to regret us being together.

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,920
Then there comes all the lies, deception.

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,870
And we'd finally drift apart.

119
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,120
But then…

120
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,270
Then what?

121
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,510
Then I realized

122
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,750
you and Jian Yang are different.

123
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,190
So none of these things will happen.

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,040
I was relieved.

125
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm also well-prepared mentally

126
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,600
to meet all the coming wild storms.

127
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,190
I have no regrets,

128
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,800
nor am I afraid.

129
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,560
You are so strong.

130
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,160
I have to become as strong as you are.

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,870
My Shorty's grown up.

132
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,750
I thought you'd be so scared

133
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,720
that you'd hide
under the covers and cry all night.

134
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,580
(17 km from the destination)

135
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,310
It's still so far.

136
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,510
Oh My God.

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,390
I didn't expect us to see
their public display of affection

138
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,310
even in a cab.

139
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,510
It makes us so jealous,

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,190
right, Mr. Driver?

141
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,830
Captain.

142
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,950
Well.

143
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,270
Tong Yao is on live streaming.

144
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,510
You want to watch it?

145
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,360
Tong Yao is on live streaming at this time.

146
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,070
She must be crazy.

147
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,680
I don't know if she's crazy.

148
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,600
I think you're crazy.

149
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,360
Now I just want to focus on e-sports.

150
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,360
(I can't believe you're live streaming.)

151
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,600
(Warning, a large number of
keyboard worriers ahead.)

152
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,120
(How dare you open a live streaming?)

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,600
(Do you want to attract more followers)

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,830
(since you've been getting
a lot of buzz lately?)

155
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,480
(Speechless.)

156
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,040
(Hello, Mrs. Lu.)

157
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,560
I've started live streaming.

158
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
Now I'm playing ranking training.

159
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,360
How can I not take advantage of it

160
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,390
to make up time for my live streaming?

161
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,430
Why am I shameless
just because I did a live streaming?

162
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,800
I used to do live streaming too.

163
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,000
If I don't do it today,

164
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,080
and at the end of the month
my live time is not enough,

165
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,480
I can only make my sleep live for you.

166
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
(Sleep with Lu Sicheng?)

167
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,790
(Dirty. I'm calling the police.)

168
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,670
(Tell us about Cheng.)

169
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,600
What about him?

170
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,910
Cheng is really a very good shooter.

171
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,750
He is now ranked in the top three in the world.

172
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,550
This shooter is probably sleeping right now.

173
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,270
After all, he took my hand
and forced me to swear

174
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,840
we'd be together in the future

175
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,390
in front of his parent this morning.

176
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,910
I'm sorry. I'm showing off again.

177
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,200
Sorry.

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,840
(You're provocative!)

179
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,630
(You're showing off.)

180
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,200
(Nice job.)

181
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,150
(Cheng is only in the top three?)

182
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,440
Yes, the top three.

183
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,480
I can't say number one, right?

184
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,240
After all, there's another shooter
who's about the same level as him

185
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,870
living next door.

186
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,750
(Do you know how to get to the point?)

187
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,960
(So when will you break up?)

188
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,790
Break up?

189
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,030
I found my boyfriend on my own merit.

190
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,150
Why should I break up with him?

191
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,670
(You've fallen in love and become weaker too.)

192
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,550
(You've rarely been killed solo
on the lane before.)

193
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,840
(Waiting for ZGDX to be ruined.)

194
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
(You're not good at playing Aoandou.)

195
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,030
I think the same way.

196
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,510
But I see that the South Korean people
are very good at playing Aoandou.

197
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,910
That's why I have to practice it.

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,270
Otherwise, if we become inferior
in the World Championships.

199
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,750
One less ban position would be wasted,

200
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,270
if I now practice one more shikigami.

201
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,360
Isn't that good?

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,630
(Where's Cheng? Is Cheng up yet?)

203
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,840
(Tell him to come on air.)

204
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,790
(Our captain should be up by now.)

205
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,200
(Our captain, ours...)

206
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,550
(The smell of PDA,
single people abuse, unsubscribe.)

207
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,840
(Cheng's here!)

208
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
Where do I rank?

209
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,870
Childish.

210
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,670
You are not childish.

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,910
The Aoandou with one kill,
six deaths, five assists.

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,360
I'll blow your head off
if you dare to take it to the game.

213
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
I'm just practicing.

214
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,120
Go away!

215
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,870
I've seen Tai use Aoandou.

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,960
It's not the way you use it.

217
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,360
Come on, let me demonstrate.

218
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
You're a shooter.

219
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,790
How can you teach me to play midsolo?

220
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,240
Let me try.

221
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't shake me.

222
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,270
Now the middle lane soldiers are in the turret.

223
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,960
Don't go up yet.

224
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,150
It is because you dare not go up,

225
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
the opposing midsolo Marisha Ray

226
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
keeps containing you.

227
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,440
Do they know that someone else is operating?

228
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,270
Be careful!

229
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,630
Quiet. Otherwise, I won't help you.

230
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,790
All right, you go away.

231
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
Go away, go away, go away.

232
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,080
No.

233
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,720
I'm on the live streaming.

234
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,630
I know.

235
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,390
(Terrific.)

236
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,790
(Next week you're playing against Alpha.)

237
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,320
(Wait to see your true skills.)

238
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,080
(Wait for your failure.)

239
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,140
(I'm tired of saying I'm envy.)

240
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,460
(I'm sorry I can't help but smiling.)

241
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,380
(I hope you guys can still be this good
next week against Alpha.)

242
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
(ZGDX vs. Alpha)

243
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,510
The strength of a veteran team like Alpha

244
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,670
is really not to be underestimated.

245
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,000
It's amazing that they made ZGDX,

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,870
who had a good run
in the National League before

247
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,270
lose the opening match.

248
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,720
(In the last match,)

249
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,150
(ZGDX's Cat and K)

250
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,480
(didn't work well together.)

251
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,080
(It was like it was their
first time working together.)

252
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,720
(Cat was constantly ganked in the last game)

253
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
(while K was still
in the jungle and ignored him.)

254
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,720
Today, ZGDX's topsolo and jungler seem

255
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,750
to be old enemies.

256
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,550
That's right.

257
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,910
I wonder if it's due to external factors.

258
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
- We've been doing well today, hold on.
- Play well.

259
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,200
We have to take it.

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,270
(The score is now zero to one.)

261
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,600
(ZGDX still seems to be in low morale)

262
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,030
(in this game.)

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Alpha

264
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,480
is known as testing
the true skills of capable teams.

265
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,390
Is ZGDX really competent

266
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,200
or is it kept bumping into superior games before?

267
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
There will be an intuitive answer

268
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
after this game.

269
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,120
ZGDX may have been good before.

270
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,200
Now Double Carry players
are obsessed with love.

271
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,550
How can they think about playing the game?

272
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,550
It's true.

273
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,200
Over the turret.

274
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,630
Coming, here we go.

275
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,320
Look, the game has just started.

276
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
Cat has already died twice.

277
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,120
He made himself killed twice in a row.

278
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,790
- Nice.
- Good job!

279
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,270
The opponent's midsolo
and jungler keep ganking Cat.

280
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,790
Chubby, let's get cracking on
developing ourselves in the lower lane.

281
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Okay.

282
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,840
Their topsolo is easy to gank.

283
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,080
Yes, yes. Come on.

284
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,720
Wait for me, I'll be right there.

285
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,550
Looks like Alpha's Aoandou and Ibaraki Douji

286
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,390
are going to outflank

287
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,480
Cat's way back to the turret.

288
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,030
The duo in lower lane have also arrived.

289
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,480
K is still in the lower half of the jungle.

290
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,270
He was going to go there.

291
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,510
But when he saw there were four opponents

292
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,630
and Cat had also little blood left,

293
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
he turned around into the jungle again.

294
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,910
(It's over, Cat is dead again.)

295
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,440
(Four to one.)

296
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,390
(Defeat)
(Isolated, the topsolo has collapsed.)

297
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,510
Are these four people playing mahjong?
Where is my teammate?

298
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,440
K came halfway and ran away.

299
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,480
(If he came there at that time,)

300
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,320
(he could do nothing but get killed too.)

301
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,150
(There was no point.)

302
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,510
Hurry up, this game is ruined.

303
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,480
Hold on, we may turn the table.

304
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,630
Cat, you develop first.

305
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,550
Don't fight with them.

306
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
You can come to my lane to take the line.

307
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,670
I'll go to the jungle to see what's available.

308
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
Give him the line.

309
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,550
Then you take my jungle.

310
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,440
You are really the good guy.

311
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,240
What's wrong with Cheng taking your jungle?

312
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,480
You haven't had enough in the jungle
since the beginning of the game?

313
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,720
You blame me for not ganking.

314
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,720
It's useless even I came there to help you
since there were four opponents.

315
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,720
When two people came,

316
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,550
I was in the bottom lane and you saw it.
I couldn't get through.

317
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,440
They even put the jungle Kirin aside.

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,390
They just wanted to screw you.

319
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,630
What can I do?

320
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
And your gold

321
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,480
has already made up from other lanes.

322
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,630
Look at the real time economy chart

323
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
after the game if you don't believe it.

324
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,670
Shut up.

325
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,840
Do you want to go on-hook and
let the opposite side push our middle turrets?

326
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,150
Pick a small team fight.

327
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,320
Coming.

328
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Copy that.

329
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,670
(Smiling suddenly jumped out of the grass)

330
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,870
(and hit the opponent's midsolo.)

331
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,390
Control it, pick the fight, go.

332
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,000
- Back to the base. Retreat, midsolo.
- We'll carry.

333
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,840
So far in this game,

334
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,150
ZGDX's topsolo has been ganked
too many times in the early stages.

335
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,270
I think they're looking for
another breakthrough.

336
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,200
But look at K,

337
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,750
he's still in the lower half of the jungle.

338
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,000
(Look, Cat is coming.)

339
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,750
(He probably wants to)

340
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,790
(take the opportunity to revenge)

341
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,910
(with the presence of Chessman.)

342
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,360
- Our midsolo.
- Coming.

343
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,390
Should we withdraw in the middle lane?

344
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,270
Give them the first turret.

345
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,270
Let's go, let's go. Give it to them.

346
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,550
They're pulling back.

347
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,550
Cat, stop the shooter.

348
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,720
We have to push this turret.

349
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,120
Don't pick the fight. Protect the shooter.

350
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,550
(At the same time,
Smiling flashes into the field,)

351
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,030
(Defeat)
killing the opposite shooter with a skill.

352
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
Retreat.

353
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,840
See,

354
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,790
K and Cat used to appear in a bundle.

355
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,080
But today, without K,

356
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,600
Cat has still played fiercely.

357
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,960
Hold on, hold on.

358
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,360
Keep a steady pace.

359
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,150
I have skills prepared.

360
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,840
Both of them failed to save Doumeki.

361
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,720
Cat was the only tough one
suffering the damage.

362
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,480
But just now Smiling

363
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,870
helped him to take revenge for once.

364
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,390
We have caught up in gold a bit.

365
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,720
Let's each lead our own lane and develop.

366
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,200
We'll team up over the Orochi later.

367
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,840
Okay.

368
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,440
Watch out, they're all leading the lines.

369
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,510
- Save the turrets.
- Clear the lines.

370
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,080
Protect the turret.

371
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Did you notice, Qiu?

372
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,240
If we say that the team fight just now

373
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,150
was caused by K stealing the turret
in the bottom lane,

374
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,550
now that they are developing separately,

375
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,080
K and Cat are still going their own way

376
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,200
as good friends.

377
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,720
It's true.

378
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,480
ZGDX's Double Carry players seem to be in love

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,360
while the topsolo and jungler
are in a bad mood today.

380
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Cat, you hold off Karasu Tengu.

381
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,270
We'll hit the Orochi.

382
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

383
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,320
(Sure enough, ZGDX's four players)

384
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
(have arrived at the river in the middle lane.)

385
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,550
(If Cat can successfully)

386
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,630
(hold off the opponent's Karasu Tengu,)

387
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,960
(they'll definitely get the Orochi.)

388
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,630
(That's right.)

389
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,240
Wait for me!
Wait for me to join the team fight.

390
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,750
(Karasu Tengu got rid of Cat's entanglement)

391
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,120
(and has gone to the middle lane
to support them with a shift.)

392
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,840
(Gathering!)

393
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,750
(Why is Cat still in the bottom turret?)

394
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,600
(But Karasu Tengu came here
after refilling its blood.)

395
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
(Is ZGDX going to play four against five?)

396
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,910
In one breath.

397
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,120
Attention, they're coming!

398
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,790
Cat, come and pick up the team fight!

399
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,200
K, find a right position and wait for Cat.

400
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,240
Cat is still in the bottom lane.

401
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,360
(ZGDX has begun hitting on Orochi.)

402
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,550
(Five people of Alpha are coming.)

403
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,360
Fight, fight.

404
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,150
We can win.

405
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,600
(Facing a four to five situation,)

406
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,150
(ZGDX's lineup has been broken up.)

407
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,510
Kill it.

408
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,320
Good, good.

409
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
Be careful with the jungler.

410
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,600
(Although Chessman's current position)

411
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
(is relatively safe now,)

412
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
(his teammates can't take it anymore.)

413
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,790
(Chubby was killed.)

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,320
Alpha's support came too fast.

415
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,910
I can't take it as a support.

416
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,720
(Cat is still in the bottom lane alone.)

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,870
(Karasu Tengu blew up
the three people of ZGDX with a jump splash.)

418
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,270
(Now the Double Carry players
have been killed.)

419
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,670
(They're definitely going to lose Orochi.)

420
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,790
(Cat is still leading the line.)

421
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,790
(Unstoppable)
(K can only hide in the grass,)

422
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,630
(watching Orochi being taken.)

423
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,240
Take Orochi as soon as possible.

424
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,270
Be careful of the opposite
Kosodenote and Yuri Lowenthal.

425
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,200
Yuri Lowenthal may use Shift.

426
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,910
(Alpha is already going to)

427
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,910
(start hitting Orochi.)

428
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
(K can't do anything)

429
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,630
(but ambush near the grass.)

430
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,840
(K went in and reclaimed Orochi.)

431
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,510
(Can he make it?)

432
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,870
(K was killed.)

433
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,960
(He was killed in a flash.)

434
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,030
What are you doing?

435
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,480
Can't even hold off Karasu Tengu.

436
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,920
You can't see what equipment I have?

437
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,270
You can't blame me for the losing of Orochi.

438
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,160
You're to blame.

439
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,960
Karasu Tengu can use Shift, why can't you?

440
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,880
I had little blood left.
Did I have to get myself killed?

441
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,510
You two stop arguing first.

442
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,200
Go on, guard the turrets.

443
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,270
Watch out for the base.

444
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,790
(Look over here.)

445
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,750
(Cat is leading the line to the base turret.)

446
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,110
(Destroyed)
But Alpha is also quite nimble.

447
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,310
Go back to the base to guard the base turret.

448
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,110
Back to the base turret!

449
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,590
(Successfully sealed)
Back to defense.

450
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,880
(Yuri Lowenthal failed to
steal the turret with the line.)

451
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
(He had to turn around and go home.)

452
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
(ZGDX's topsolo)

453
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,830
(got killed so many times in the early stage.)

454
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,790
Look at the data chart.

455
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,680
He only assisted twice.

456
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,160
And he lags far behind in gold.

457
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,550
They also lost Orochi at this time.

458
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,750
If ZGDX doesn't change its tactics,

459
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,720
it's going to be hard for them to play.

460
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,510
Alpha is definitely going to

461
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,590
take advantage of the situation
to destroy their base turret.

462
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,270
(After a few team fights today,)

463
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,240
(I feel that ZGDX)

464
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
(is already a bit loose.)

465
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,680
Yes.

466
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,550
The players may have collapsed.

467
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:49,750
Yes.

468
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,480
(If Alpha forces to fight at this time,)

469
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,510
(it'll be highly possible that they win.)

470
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,400
It's coming, it's coming.

471
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,790
(K wanted to go around the back
to gank Alpha's back row.)

472
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
(But he was controlled.)

473
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,590
(Cat is in.)

474
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,240
(What's the point of coming in now?)

475
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,270
(K is already dead.)

476
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,720
(Cat has become a solo fighter.)

477
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,880
(Defense turret requires support)
(He came in after K was dead.)

478
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,070
(Double Kill)
(This is too late.)

479
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,480
Yes.

480
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,310
Let's go.

481
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,110
(Alpha is coming up here!)

482
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,030
They're about to push it
all the way to the base.

483
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,480
(Support needed for our junction)
(Can Smiling and the others still hold it?)

484
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,550
Come on, control him.

485
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:15,960
Hold on, hold on!

486
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,830
No front row, no front row!

487
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,590
Clear the soldier line.

488
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,750
(Has been completely exposed to)

489
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,830
(the opponent's damage.)

490
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,880
Clear the soldier line!

491
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,590
I'll take it, I'll take it.

492
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,510
It's because of infighting
between the good friends K and Cat.

493
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,550
There is no cooperation at all.

494
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,550
Chessman and Smiling refilled their blood.

495
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,830
But Cat has sacrificed.
There is no front row.

496
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,790
Alpha's Doumeki has been hitting base.

497
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,750
(So far in this game,)

498
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,160
(it's already very difficult for ZGDX to play)

499
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,440
(for losing the top turrets.)

500
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,920
Alpha, Alpha is on!

501
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,510
(Alpha is hitting the base)

502
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,200
(like crazy.)

503
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,550
(The base was destroyed.)

504
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,510
(With the sound of the base explosion,)

505
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,880
(ZGDX receives)

506
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,070
(their first defeat in the national league.)

507
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,240
Congratulations to Alpha for winning the game!

508
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,110
(Congratulations to Alpha!)

509
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,590
(So after this game,)

510
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,110
(I've thought of)

511
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,920
(some criticism)

512
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,030
(ZGDX has been received.)

513
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,310
(Do you mean)

514
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,160
(that ZGDX would suffer a decline
in fighting ability)

515
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,880
(and be trapped in adversity)

516
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,510
(with the Double Carry players in a relationship?)

517
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,200
What's wrong?

518
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,590
Thinking of the phrase "Great failure".

519
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,240
You're back?

520
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,030
We were not in good morale.

521
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,240
It's normal to lose

522
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,640
to an old team like Alpha. It's okay.

523
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,480
Keep up the spirit.

524
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,440
Yeah.

525
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,640
Next week's match against FNC will be a tough one.

526
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Let's learn from our mistakes.

527
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,550
And YQCB are not to be underestimated either.

528
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,510
The team next door is really capable now.

529
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,000
Since Hierophant joined the team,

530
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,720
the whole team's style has changed.

531
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,270
It's like a catalyst.

532
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
Even their captain's support has become

533
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,400
the previous support god of seat match.

534
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,270
Fierce and aggressive.

535
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,510
If they take advantage of the opportunity,

536
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,350
the opponent can scarcely turn around.

537
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,110
If we don't want to lose the next game,

538
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,830
it depends on whether our jungler

539
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
cares about the topsolo.

540
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,350
That also depends on whether our topsolo

541
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,030
will play around

542
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,750
when gold is fallen behind.

543
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,510
With such a mentality,

544
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,510
we may lose the game again.

545
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,790
Oh my god!

546
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,790
K's eyes are so scary.

547
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,030
I'm scared.

548
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,200
Scared of what?

549
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,400
It's screwed.

550
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,200
Our topsolo and jungler are having a breakup.

551
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,270
What?

552
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,030
Cat and K.

553
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,070
They are having a childish tantrum.

554
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,680
Someone needs to take the willow
and beat them up to make them well-behaved.

555
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,880
Actually, I advocate education of love.

556
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,440
Really?

557
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,680
K just changed

558
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,400
the everlasting name of his live studio.

559
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,880
It's used to be

560
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,920
"Losing points double-queued with Princess Cat".

561
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,550
No way!

562
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,920
Is the relationship breakdown drama over yet?

563
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
(The new princess is about to take office.)

564
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,070
(Choose me, choose me.)

565
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,030
(Is this guy not at the base?)

566
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,240
These fans are too good at taking
the public opinion to the wrong way.

567
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,590
Are you going to kill your K?

568
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,350
Are you?

569
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,350
You just want it to be worse, right?

570
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,200
And you even laugh like this?

571
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,440
The on-lookers are eager to

572
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,830
fan the flames.

573
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,350
I'm tired. I'm offline.

574
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,000
They can't be serious this time, can they?

575
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,440
Are you ready to go to bed?

576
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,440
I'll talk to you on the phone later.

577
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,030
What?

578
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,590
I say…

579
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,160
What can I do for you?

580
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,750
I came to talk to you about K and Cat.

581
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,270
They don't look so good

582
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,480
after leaving

583
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,070
the gaming field.

584
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,310
Go on.

585
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,510
K doesn't even double-queue with Cat anymore.

586
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,270
And it's already eleven o'clock.

587
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,720
Cat is missing too.

588
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,000
It's eleven o'clock.

589
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,480
Do you want to sleep at my place tonight?

590
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,160
Lu Sicheng, I'm talking something serious with you.

591
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,200
They were talking about Cat

592
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,240
in the live streaming.

593
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
K just shut down the live streaming and left.

594
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,720
He looked pretty mad.

595
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,310
So?

596
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,550
Tomorrow there is a training match with CK.

597
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,830
How can they play tomorrow like this?

598
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,720
You are the captain, don't you care?

599
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,880
You're thinking too much.

600
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,720
Being ganked in the game is already irritating.

601
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,960
They are not children.

602
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,240
They'll be fine after a while.

603
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,440
Remember what you said today.

604
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,310
What did I say?

605
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,400
If we lose the training game tomorrow

606
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,750
because of them,

607
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,160
don't nag about it.

608
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,830
I...

609
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,590
Then you go tell K and Cat later

610
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,550
that if they lose tomorrow's training match,

611
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,400
they may be banned from the game.

612
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,830
Tell them I said it.

613
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,550
What's the point of threatening people with a ban?

614
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,920
Either you don't care

615
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,030
or you use this way?

616
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,400
Go deal with it yourself.

617
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
I won't tell them this.

618
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,160
What do you want me to say?

619
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,160
To teach with love.

620
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,400
They are not you.

621
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,920
You haven't given me love either.

622
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,750
If it's love

623
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
when you stand at my back

624
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,920
while I'm playing in the ranking,

625
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,200
saying I'm not doing it right,

626
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,440
and I'm like a handicapped person
with weird equipment,

627
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,590
I have to wonder

628
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,590
do you even know

629
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,310
the correct meaning of the word "love"?

630
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,400
Why should I know

631
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,920
the correct meaning of the word "love"?

632
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,240
I don't need to do these as a captain.

633
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,640
I'll go say it myself.

634
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,830
Cat.

635
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,880
Go to sleep in your room.

636
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,440
I want to sleep here.

637
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,070
It's not worth it.

638
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
Can't you guys just talk?

639
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,880
I have nothing to talk about with him.

640
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,480
I'm really worried.

641
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,070
Explain.

642
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,110
Me? Explain what?

643
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,440
I was contained on the top lane.

644
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
I couldn't go anywhere.

645
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,550
Besides, I made up for the loss of gold

646
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,880
on other lanes.

647
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,960
Look at the real time gold distribution chart
if you don't believe me.

648
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,160
At 20 minutes into the game,

649
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,350
the rate of participation
in the team fight was only 11.7%

650
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,480
as a topsolo.

651
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,440
The damage you did to the enemy shikigamis

652
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,400
was just 12,000,

653
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,550
only 2,000 more than the support did.

654
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,640
From 12 minutes and 18 seconds onwards,

655
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,830
there were seven major and minor team fights,

656
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
in which you only came once.

657
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,960
That's when K was not there.

658
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,920
and also our only victory.

659
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,350
By the data of your

660
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,510
zero kills, six deaths and two assists,

661
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,920
you were like sleepwalking the whole game.

662
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,310
(Except for the team participation rate
and kill statistics,)

663
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,310
(there are no data records)

664
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,200
(about the team fights)

665
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,880
(and who was there and
who wasn't when Cat was present.)

666
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,400
(This is all marked by Lu Sicheng's brain.)

667
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,440
(What a wondrous brain.)

668
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,480
(As expected of a Scorpio, he's so vindictive.)

669
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,030
It's not that I couldn't hold off the team fights.

670
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,640
It's that I wasn't right equipped.

671
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,830
I was economically far behind the opposite side.

672
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,590
My skills were indifferent to them.

673
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,200
During the team fight over the Orochi,

674
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
K blindly

675
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,510
went to the face of
the opposite midsolo and jungler.

676
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,310
If you came there first with Shift,

677
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,030
you'd have arrived at the same time
with the opposite topsolo.

678
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,070
You also would have had enough time
to delay the other side

679
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,440
and wait until

680
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,640
K's refreshed skills killed the midsolo instead.

681
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
But what was the result?

682
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,830
You didn't come.

683
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,030
And K,

684
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,880
why didn't you support Cat in time

685
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,680
at the critical moment as a jungler?

686
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,680
What were you thinking?

687
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,070
It was like three or four people
on the other side lived in the top lane.

688
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,440
I could only be killed there.

689
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,720
Wasn't Tong Yao there for you?

690
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,000
Would she watch you die?

691
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,070
It doesn't matter if we win or lose a game.

692
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,240
I can accept it.

693
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,640
We lost to CK in the Spring Finals.

694
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,590
Did we say anything?

695
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,480
But if you don't want to play the game,

696
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,110
or if you play the game

697
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,200
with an infighting mentality,

698
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
I think you can drop it.

699
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,920
What are you doing?

700
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,550
Don't get angry. Talk properly.

701
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,030
Think about it yourselves.

702
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,200
("I have my empress")
(Just protect them like this.)

703
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,110
(Sent to "I have my empress")
(What kind of crazy alias did you get for me?)

704
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,510
(Lu Yue changed it.)

705
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,920
(It doesn't seem to be wrong.)

706
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,310
(It's not wrong?)

707
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,590
("Rabbit Tightly Holds the Carrot")
(This name was changed to remind)

708
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,270
(your countless pursuers)

709
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,350
(not to act rashly.)

710
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,480
(Sent to "Rabbit Tightly Holds the Carrot")
(You're the only one.)

711
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,900
(I want to bond with you)

712
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,880
(I want to bond with you)
(All right?)

713
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,640
(You're being unreasonable.)

714
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,550
(How is it?)

715
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,240
(How about this name?)

716
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,240
(There is the second half.)

717
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,110
(Untie the clothes.)

718
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,310
(Enter the bridal chamber.)

719
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,720
(Bastard!)

720
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,110
(I came to talk to you about the serious thing.)

721
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,440
(You interrupted me first.)

722
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,830
(I told you not to protect
those two kids in the team.)

723
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,030
(If you don't hold their heads down
and make them admit their mistakes,)

724
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,680
(they will continue to argue.)

725
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,830
(Sent to "I want to bond with you")
(I was just analyzing it with you)

726
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,070
(about the education of love.)

727
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,590
(I was afraid that you'd say
those words to ban them)

728
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,160
(and stimulate their rebellion.)

729
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,590
(I told you)

730
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,510
(to treat teammates with love.)

731
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,960
(You have to teach with love.)

732
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,550
(If they'll still be like this in the next game,)

733
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,750
(are you really going to ignore it?)

734
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,750
(Don't worry.)

735
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,480
(They'll be fine next time.)

736
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,750
(How do you know?)

737
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,200
(Because I'm the captain.)

738
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,160
(As long as I can, they can.)

739
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,310
(Give them one night to regulate themselves.)

740
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,640
(And if)

741
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,830
(there's any more of this shit
in the game after this,)

742
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,960
(you'll see)

743
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,720
(what your provoked captain is like.)

744
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,830
(Dictator.)

745
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,590
(No.)

746
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,830
(Take the mess you're in charge.)

747
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,110
(Or you'll be scolded too.)

748
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,070
(I didn't take over any mess.)

749
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,350
(Captain, when you were analyzing with them,)

750
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,640
(I saw your handsome face close,)

751
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,920
(thinking, "My man is so handsome.")

752
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,270
(I really want to kiss you.)

753
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,310
(It's too late.)

754
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,480
(Come on, I'll cut the back row.)

755
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,510
(Give them a mirror to look at.)

756
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,070
They'll probably have

757
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,920
a deep understanding

758
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,680
of guilty conscience from now on.

759
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,510
K, are you single-queued?

760
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,550
Are you hungry?

761
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,480
Should I let Cat get you something to eat?

762
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,070
Cat, K said he wanted to
double-queue with you.

763
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,030
Really?

764
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,750
Really. Hurry up!

765
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,880
Go!

766
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,920
Stupid topsolo.

767
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,480
Chose an output-typed shikigami

768
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,790
with less output than the support's.

769
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,030
He's not at all…

770
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,920
Cat wants to double-queue with you.

771
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,200
Let him.

772
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,540
(Data)

773
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,940
(Lord of Kyoto)

774
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,350
Double-queue?

775
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,920
K.

776
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,440
You have to go help Cat.

777
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,160
It looks like a set-up.

778
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,000
Come on, come on.

779
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,510
I'm going to help Cat in the top lane.

780
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,240
If I don't help Cat, who will help Cat?

781
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,400
I don't want to be blamed later.

782
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,400
Blame you, I don't dare to blame you.

783
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,750
Cat.

784
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,070
K is here.

785
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,030
Quick, go help him take the damage.

786
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,070
Okay, I got it.

787
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,550
Help him take it. Go.

788
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,000
Go! Cat cuts back!

789
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,880
Isn't that the end of this fight?

790
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,000
This is good.

791
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,680
The game is over, isn't it?

792
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,880
You two are a perfect combination,
a perfect match.

793
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,200
That's enough.

794
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm not playing anymore. I'm hungry.

795
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
I haven't eaten anything all day.

796
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,720
I'll treat you to your favorite roast pork.

797
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,030
Let's go then.

798
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,350
We can buy some of
the delicious duck neck by the way.

799
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,350
Okay, let's go.

800
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,920
Let's go, Tong Yao, are you going?

801
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,680
I'm not. You two go.

802
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,640
- Ok, we're leaving.
- Let's go.

803
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,030
What a fool.

804
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,880
Do you want to be beaten up?

805
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,920
I can do it too.

806
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,960
Don't you move!

807
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,400
(Silly pig.)

808
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
(The education of love is completed.)

809
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,630
(Please check on it.)

810
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,230
(You are all cursing the midsolo and topsolo.)

811
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,000
(Does ZGDX's Shooter)

812
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,230
(really get rid of all curse?)

813
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,960
(Now even Chessman is not spared.)

814
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,070
(Amazing! You guys are crazy!)

815
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,400
(The blame is clearly divided.)

816
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,670
(You're not that fat support, are you?)

817
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,760
(Your team's midsolo is not a princess)

818
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,670
(but Tong Daji,
the scourge of the country and the people.)

819
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,630
(If you keep messing around like this,)

820
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,280
(ZGDX will be screwed.)

821
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,360
(You've reached your hand too far.)

822
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,190
(I don't want to say too many unpleasant words.)

823
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,320
(You're the one
who's hindering ZGDX's path to the championship.)

824
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,510
(Please don't add to the problem.)

825
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,440
What are you watching?

826
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,150
Nothing.

827
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,760
It's just those posts on the internet
that are scolding us.

828
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,320
Why did you come in
without knocking on the door again?

829
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,630
What's wrong with you?

830
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,190
I've been kidnapped.

831
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,710
Morality and conscience.

832
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,150
Didn't we agree to grow

833
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,360
and get stronger together?

834
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,510
Why are you so venerable now?

835
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,150
I'm not venerable.

836
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,880
I was just thinking

837
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,190
we lost the match with Alpha,

838
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,440
so it's normal there are those cursing posts

839
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,360
on the Internet.

840
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,480
But I'm more worried about the next game.

841
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,800
If we lose,

842
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,510
I will really become the scourge

843
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,550
they say.

844
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,320
Bullshit.

845
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,150
Cheng.

846
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,030
Won't you feel aggrieved

847
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,840
and regretful?

848
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,360
No, I won't.

849
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,030
I've never regretted anything.

850
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,670
You're just thinking too much.

851
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,880
If we had won all the finalists,

852
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,670
that's what would make people feel uneasy, right?

853
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,360
But I don't want to lose.

854
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,920
I don't want to lose even if it's a finalist.

855
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,320
and the following opponents of YQCB and FNC

856
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,440
are both very capable.

857
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,550
That's right.

858
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,230
That's why we have to adjust our mindset.

859
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,030
A little bit of inattentiveness and low morale

860
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,280
can be the reasons why we may lose the game.

861
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,800
But it's not going to be you.

862
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,070
And

863
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,400
losing now

864
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
is better than losing
in the elimination rounds

865
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,230
and the national finals, right?

866
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,510
Because it's really the time

867
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,320
when we can't afford to lose.

868
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Cheng.

869
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,280
Don't you think I've been working
so hard for the team?

870
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,510
Shouldn't you give me a treat?

871
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,400
We have a game tomorrow, you rascal.

872
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,510
I know.

873
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,280
Don't worry.

874
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,960
We won't lose.

875
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,190
Okay, okay, okay.

876
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,320
Okay, I know.

877
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,670
(What do you mean by that?)

878
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,920
(I just took a few killings from you.)

879
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,710
(Literally.)

880
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,320
Guys,

881
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,670
as the saying goes, one disaster after another...

882
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,840
Recently, there are many
bad comments on the Internet

883
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,360
about our team.

884
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,280
So the club arranged for our captain

885
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
to participate in a live gaming interview

886
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
to save the reputation of our team.

887
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,920
Live interview?

888
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,320
Cheng must participate.

889
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,440
It's performance-based.

890
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm not going.

891
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,800
You can't not go to this one.

892
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,110
The sponsor of this show

893
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,480
is a partner of our club.

894
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,320
Cheng, you must cooperate with this.

895
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,440
Otherwise, I'm afraid Mrs. Wang
will come to talk to you again.

896
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,800
Attention everyone.

897
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,280
Now is a critical time to guide public opinion.

898
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,590
You must remain calm and wise

899
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,360
when you see bad comments on the Internet.

900
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,440
Wise?

901
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,710
Who are you talking about?

902
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,760
Don't get too excited.

903
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,880
Remember.

904
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Love and peace.

905
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,000
Cheng, can we start now?

906
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,510
Cheng, thank you for
taking the time out of your schedule

907
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,670
during the game-preparation period

908
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,760
to give us an interview.

909
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm also a fan of ZGDX.

910
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,030
So today we have chosen

911
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,630
several issues

912
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,880
that fans are heatedly discussing online.

913
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,480
We'd like to hear your opinion.

914
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,320
Please go ahead.

915
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,320
Has the recent loss against Alpha

916
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,800
had a big impact on the team?

917
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,480
Some people say
that Cat and K's relationship broke up.

918
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,920
Some people even shout

919
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,510
the slogan that ZGDX will soon embrace its end.

920
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
What do you think about this?

921
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,880
There was a problem in the coordination

922
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,510
between Cat and K

923
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,840
in the match with Alpha.

924
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,670
But it was just one game.

925
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,510
As a captain,

926
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,440
my focus is on how to fix

927
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,880
what we did wrong

928
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,190
instead of focusing on the meaningless cursing

929
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,280
on the internet.

930
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,150
Can you talk more about

931
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
the root cause of this loss?

932
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,800
The root cause?

933
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,760
Because many fans have mentioned

934
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,150
although it seems to be

935
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,550
the mistake of Cat and K,

936
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,150
ZGDX has had a harmonious relationship

937
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,190
since Ming joined in.

938
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,440
There has never been such an incident.

939
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,400
So this time

940
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,070
does the root cause of the team's defeat

941
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,000
have something to do

942
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,480
with the love affair within the team?

943
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,630
Would the members of the team

944
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,400
be affected

945
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,800
because of the love affair
between you and Tong Yao?

946
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,960
First of all,

947
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,800
although Tong Yao is my teammate,

948
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,760
our relationship is our private matter.

949
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,480
It has nothing to do
with the team competition.

950
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,710
Second of all,

951
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,230
for those who question that our team

952
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,510
has conflicts

953
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,710
because I'm in love with Tong Yao,

954
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,070
I have only one answer.

955
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,150
If the series of guess that

956
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,070
ZGDX is coming to an end

957
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,190
is all out of your own speculation,

958
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,590
turn off our gaming video now,

959
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,590
return our gaming tickets

960
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,710
tear off our autographs,

961
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,000
and burn our pictures.

962
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,280
If you have any, of course,

963
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,960
and unfollow me on Weibo.

964
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,840
Cheng, aren't you afraid of hurting

965
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,000
the hearts of your fans
who have always supported you

966
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,880
like this?

967
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,920
I thank you from the bottom of my heart

968
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,400
for your support and love in the past.

969
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,510
But I'm not sorry to see you go.

970
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,880
You don't have to tell me by private message.

971
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,710
I won't read it.

972
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,110
Even if I do, I won't regret it.

973
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,590
Goodbye.

974
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,230
Cheng, don't you think you should

975
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,360
apologize to your fans for this?

976
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,550
What's the reason for my apology?

977
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,880
If ZGDX lost the ticket
to World Championships this year

978
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
because of the two Carry players,

979
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,280
I would apologize.

980
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,030
But today I won't,

981
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,320
because ZGDX is still here.

982
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,030
We just lost one game.

983
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,480
If we become the building you see as falling down

984
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,630
because of this one loss,

985
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,110
I have to ask you:

986
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,710
is this what you call supporting ZGDX?

987
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm disappointed.

988
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,070
I'm also very sad.

989
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,800
I even have to apologize to myself.

990
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,360
How do I get to have a group of you fans

991
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,150
who echo the views of others?

992
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
And those keyboard warriors

993
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,230
misleading public opinion on the internet,

994
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,960
I ask you to retract your personal attacks on me,

995
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,440
ZGDX and Tong Yao.

996
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
You should also remember one thing.

997
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,880
The internet is not a lawless place.

998
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,000
If you feel so free to let out your malice,

999
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,550
you may have to pay for it in the future

1000
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,360
with a more serious price than you think.

1001
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,710
Let me say one last thing.

1002
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,760
Don't think I'm perfect.

1003
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm not... I'm not... I can't handle it.

1004
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,590
E-sports

1005
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,150
and our midsolo

1006
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,440
are equally important in my heart.

1007
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,480
Not one of them is dispensable.

1008
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,510
(E-sports and our midsolo)

1009
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,110
(are equally important in my heart.)

1010
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,230
(- Fans can unfollow us if you're not satisfied.)
(- He doesn't care about us at all.)

1011
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,800
(- I'm speechless.)
(- I regret that)

1012
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,820
(I liked Chessman for the past few years.)

1013
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,770
(Do you think we dare not?)

1014
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,550
(I'm the equal sign in Cheng's heart.)

1015
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,230
(I apologize to all of you for him.)

1016
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:57,960
(My youth is gone.)

1017
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,800
(Equally important? In the future, will it…)

1018
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,000
(be less important?)

1019
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,280
(E-sports is less important than Tong Daiji.)

1020
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,440
(Unfollow him and become his hater.)

1021
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,150
(I'm going to send a razor blade.)

1022
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,710
(It's not possible.)

1023
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,230
These keyboard warriors

1024
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,800
can only chatter on the Internet.

1025
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,550
Can they really send
razor blades to you in reality?

1026
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,030
It'll be fine in a few days.

1027
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,590
What an ominous prediction.

1028
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,710
What on earth is going on?

1029
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,030
Why has the public opinion of ZGDX

1030
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,710
become so negative?

1031
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,230
Yeah, right.

1032
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,320
First, the Double Carry players' love affair
became public.

1033
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,320
We weren't even given a chance to prepare for

1034
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,280
the public opinion.

1035
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,550
Do you know how many fans

1036
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,280
returned our orders

1037
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,800
because the players they liked were in love?

1038
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,360
This is nonsense!

1039
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,280
Yes, it is.

1040
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,710
As the captain of ZGDX,

1041
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,510
not only does Lu Sicheng have no responsibility
for the team's reputation,

1042
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,030
but also have no respect at all

1043
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,630
for our sponsors.

1044
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,480
Why are things so out of control now?

1045
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,190
The last time I asked you to issue a statement

1046
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,880
that the players' personal matters
would be separated from the games.

1047
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,150
But now what?

1048
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,550
Personal matters
are affecting business matters.

1049
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,000
Who is responsible?

1050
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Who can be responsible?

1051
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,280
(Yao.)

1052
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,800
(What is the situation now?)

1053
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,510
(Why are those who scold you
on the Internet so harsh?)

1054
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,190
(When have you ever)

1055
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,280
(been so aggravated since childhood?)

1056
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,710
Are you okay?

1057
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,510
Mom, I'm fine.

1058
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,440
I won't lose a piece of flesh

1059
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,710
just because those people
on the internet are scolding me.

1060
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,480
Don't worry.

1061
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,800
I'm going to train first.
I have a game tomorrow.

1062
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,660
(Mother)

1063
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,670
(I've warned you before.)

1064
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,400
(The path you've chosen will be difficult.)

1065
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,280
I know.

1066
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,030
(I know the attitude of the club.)

1067
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,840
(If the team is no longer viable,)

1068
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,550
(you can go home
and inherit the family business.)

1069
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,920
You're still joking with me at this point.

1070
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,000
(No one is joking with you here.)

1071
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,760
Please don't think about it anymore.

1072
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,070
I'll walk all the way

1073
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,880
on this path.

1074
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,230
Chessman.

1075
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,150
