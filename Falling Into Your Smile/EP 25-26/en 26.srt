1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,910
(How Tong Daji is made?)
(Well done.)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,680
(Now Lu Sicheng has begun to)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,080
(deceive the girls who met them at that time)

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
(under the guise of staff.)

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,030
(Everyone, pay attention to what I am saying.)

6
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,000
(This is Tong Daji.)

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,320
(On the first day she came to the ZGDX base,)

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,030
(she actually asked the captain)

9
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,400
(to drive an Aston Martin to the supermarket.)

10
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,600
(She really knows how to seduce men.)

11
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,920
(Someone must have played the game for her.)

12
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,390
(What a bitch!)

13
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,550
(Back then, I thought
she had some ulterior motive)

14
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,120
(for flattering Cheng in such a calm manner)

15
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,230
(in front of Yang.)

16
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,390
(Yeah! Yeah!)

17
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,870
(She's too disgusting,)

18
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,160
(as she's unfaithful to her ex-boyfriend.)

19
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,510
(She ran into Yang in a ranked match
just a few days after she joined the team.)

20
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
(The cat is obedient. So am I.)
(I suppose I don't need to refresh your memory)

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,640
(about how Tong Daji flattered Lu Sicheng.)

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
(She and the noble consorts of)

23
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,070
(ancient China are on the same level
in winning men's favor.)

24
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,000
(Don't blame all the faults on women.)

25
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,670
(- Both she and he are to blame.)
(- Yeah.)

26
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,840
(One is flirtatious and the other is shameless.)

27
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,710
(So naturally they meet each other's needs.)

28
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,600
(- If Lu Sicheng was a gentleman...)
(- Yeah.)

29
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,920
(Tong Daji couldn't have pressed
his head to make him kiss her.)

30
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,000
(...and made him fall
in love with her gradually.)

31
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,710
(Tong Daji finally achieved her goal.)

32
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,470
(Since then, Lu Sicheng has cared about
nothing but her.)

33
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,840
(Double Carry players are in a relationship.)

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
(The jungler is not getting along
with the topsolo.)

35
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,150
(Can ZGDX)

36
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,520
(still go all out
in the national final this year?)

37
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,560
(ZGDX will be doomed.
This post can be used as evidence.)

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,070
(After Tong Daji joined the team,)

39
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,120
(the level of ZGDX has fallen significantly.)

40
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,070
(Sure enough,)

41
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,200
(it was actually defeated by Alpha
for the first time.)

42
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,640
(At this rate,)

43
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,150
(ZGDX is unlikely to win
the championship this season.)

44
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
(Everyone, you may as well support other teams.)

45
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,070
(There's no need to follow a team)

46
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,280
(where the shooter and midsolo
value their relationship more than anything.)

47
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,120
(Love between Team Leader and Tong Daji)

48
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
(ruins the good reputation of ZGDX for years.)

49
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,860
(I wish Tong Yao never joined ZGDX.)

50
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,140
=Falling into Your Smile=

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,900
=Episode 26=

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,100
(Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao
behave like a prima donnas.)

53
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm gonna try to persuade the company

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,910
to delete these negative posts.

55
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,590
And you'd better not

56
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,080
play with your phone these days.

57
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,310
Don't look at Weibo,

58
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,840
E-sports Industry Farm

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,680
or forums.

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,960
It's for your own good.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,630
Surf the Internet less

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,030
and concentrate on the competition.

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
Don't look at those imaginary things.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,520
Otherwise, your state of mind will be affected
during the competition.

65
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,120
It doesn't matter
whether you look at your phones or not.

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,430
It's OK if you can win the next competition.

67
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,910
They will close their mouths then.

68
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,310
You win the e-sports competition
with your hands,

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,560
not your mouths.

70
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,080
Clear?

71
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,310
Kubinashi is not on the line.

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,150
Tong Yao, after you clear the line,
go to the top jungle opposite.

73
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,120
Roger.

74
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,080
Now the score is 1-0.

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
Can ZGDX that has won the first round

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
strike while the iron is hot

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,590
and win the competition directly?

78
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,520
At the moment,

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
both sides are exhausting
each other's blood volume in their fight.

80
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,470
(In this round, ZGDX)

81
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,240
(plays more steadily than the previous round.)

82
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,080
(- Yeah!)
(- I wonder how FNC will respond to it.)

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,430
(In the previous round,)

84
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,430
(Smiling really did a good job.)

85
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,470
She defeated the opponents easily.

86
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,150
Before they have time to react,

87
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,870
the four of FNC has exhausted
most of their blood volume.

88
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,360
She's worthy of the nickname "Queen of Mage".

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
She's likely to dominate the competition.

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Yeah.

91
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,240
Gather together.

92
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
Lets' pick up a small team fight.

93
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,000
- I'm coming.
- OK.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,400
Roger.

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
Gather. Get started.
Chubby, put up with the damage.

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,940
(Shield Disappeared)

97
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,660
(Rampage)

98
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,910
Good job!

99
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,000
Withdraw.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Chase.

101
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,470
Chubby, follow me.

102
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm coming.

103
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,820
(Perfect Power)

104
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,100
(Killingspree)

105
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,260
(God's Envoy)

106
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,620
(Perfect Power)

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,390
I was right.

108
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,000
Sure enough,
Smiling has dominated the competition today.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,920
In the last ace,
she not only protected Chessman,

110
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,870
but also got rewarded
by killing the hero of the opposition.

111
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,800
(Well done. Let us congratulate ZGDX)

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,240
(on winning the competition immediately
after their previous success.)

113
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,560
Thanks to the Double Carry players

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,040
of ZGDX for their perfect cooperation.

115
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,870
Thanks to them for bringing us
such a wonderful competition.

116
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,830
Exactly. Besides,
the use of Triple Kill at the beginning,

117
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,510
definitely didn't let us down.

118
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,560
Congratulations to ZGDX again

119
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,830
on winning the competition.

120
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,600
Congratulations.

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,270
Let's go.

122
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,950
Let's go.

123
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,020
(ZGDX_Smiling MVP)

124
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Congratulations to ZGDX

125
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,870
on winning the competition successfully.

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
Congratulations to Smiling

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
on securing the MVP award
in two successive rounds.

128
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,870
Thanks.

129
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,390
So what's it like

130
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,240
returning to the team again
and playing with your teammates?

131
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,270
Good.

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,680
There were many rumors about us.

133
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,430
So we were all a little depressed and nervous.

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,270
I believe we will be relieved
after this competition.

135
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,360
We have seen that

136
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,310
ZGDX's tactics

137
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,830
were actually adjusted a little this week.

138
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,070
And it seemed Cheng was not the only one
to take command of the situation.

139
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,190
Were there some adjustments

140
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,310
in this aspect?

141
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,270
Yeah.

142
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,870
We are adapting to it now.

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,630
Everyone is very active.

144
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you going to
get someone to replace Cheng to command?

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,270
He's always been our best choice.

146
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,040
He won't be replaced,

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,870
unless over his dead body.

148
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,720
Recently,

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,390
as for the captain's response
to the fans online,

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,190
we know many people

151
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,070
have doubted you.

152
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,040
Is there anything you want to say

153
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,160
to your teammates and fans?

154
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,950
(I have secured the MVP award twice.)

155
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,120
(Is that what you have doubts about?)

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,430
- Smiling, come on!
- Come on!

157
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,680
- We're always with you.
- You're the best.

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,480
Come on, Smiling.

159
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,860
You've got our strong support forever.

160
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,080
- Way to go! You're the best.
- We'll be by your side forever.

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,750
- Smiling, cheer up!
- You're the best.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,310
I don't know

163
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,830
what identity I should use

164
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,190
to answer this question.

165
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,750
I have played in competitions

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
and have been Lu Sicheng's teammate
for half a season.

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,070
I suppose I know

168
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,270
what he and ZGDX

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
actually want.

170
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,600
I believe all of you know too.

171
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,040
He hopes someday

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,430
that he can drape
the Five-Starred Red Flag over his shoulders,

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,390
stand at the top of the global arena

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,870
and raise the trophy we are dreaming of.

175
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,190
Before that,

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
it's ok even if he has thistles and thorns
draped around his shoulders

177
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,830
or treads on the burning hot sand.

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,390
As the captain of ZGDX,

179
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,480
everyone expects too much from him.

180
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,750
He's willing to accept this fact.

181
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,390
He should,

182
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,630
and also must accept it.

183
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,160
So for some of his fans,

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,000
we can understand that

185
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
you want to protect him.

186
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,510
But performance

187
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,190
is actually what e-sports is all about.

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,510
Is the player you admire

189
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,920
someone who shines at the arena

190
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,830
or someone who's just tall

191
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
and a little handsome?

192
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,720
You should get it straight.

193
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,720
I know

194
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
girls in the industry of e-sports

195
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
have always been treated badly online.

196
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,070
So many of them
are trying to correct the situation.

197
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,270
But I want to ask you.

198
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,680
When we're trying hard
to practice in the ranked contests,

199
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,800
watching the competition

200
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,390
and analyzing the situation,

201
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,240
what are you doing?

202
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,270
That's all.

203
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,310
I'll get put down if I continue.

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,510
But for what I have just said,

205
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,750
I won't regret it

206
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,600
if it offends you.

207
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,750
Thanks.

208
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,870
She really has the guts.

209
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,750
I think her words make sense.

210
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,630
What are you doing here?

211
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,000
You scared me to death.

212
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,600
You tell me what I'm doing here.

213
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,440
It's so sweaty.

214
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,440
Don't say those words
if you're not brave enough.

215
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,390
Now you're afraid after you've said them.

216
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,790
I noticed that you almost
couldn't walk properly when you left.

217
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,910
Enough.

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,550
Who did I do that for?

219
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,790
Actually after I finished

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,390
at the platform,

221
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,240
I was worried that you would scold me.

222
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Why?

223
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,360
Since the model incident at the exhibition,

224
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,790
I promised you I would be a good person.

225
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,030
But I'm not good now.

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
You have become mature.

227
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Yeah.

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,150
This time

229
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,960
I'll forgive you.

230
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,150
(It's not easy for a girl)

231
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,630
(to play professional competitions
in the industry of e-sports.)

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
(Smiling, way to go!)

233
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,000
(Everyone, you should be tolerant of her.)

234
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,080
Guang.

235
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Recently many people
have doubted Smiling online.

236
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,390
How do you feel about it?

237
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,510
Smiling is a very good person.

238
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,750
Those who criticized her

239
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,030
probably will never know her good qualities.

240
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,480
They don't want to know either.

241
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Smiling is a wonderful professional player.

242
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,910
Pay attention to my wording.
I said "professional player".

243
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,240
Who's bad-mouthing Smiling?

244
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,910
What should I say?

245
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,360
There's nothing I can say.

246
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
Everyone, I advise you

247
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,390
not to judge unfairly a noble person
with your own despicable minds.

248
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,000
(DO.Five_LINGMAO)
Don't defame Smiling and mislead others

249
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,550
(Everything is not absolute.)
in my live room,

250
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,790
(Let Yang speak.)
or any one's live room on my team.

251
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,790
(CK_Sunflower)
For those who can't understand the competition,

252
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,200
(It makes you want to cry, right?)
please don't talk nonsense and disgrace yourselves.

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,390
Unpleasant things about Smiling
are forbidden in my room.

254
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,790
It's not interesting since
those unpleasant remarks will be blocked.

255
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,030
(Smiling, you're shameless!)
No! Forbid those remarks!

256
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,600
(I feel sorry for Yang.)
My support for her

257
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
(Keep calm.)
doesn't have anything to do with the past.

258
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,720
(Girls can't play the competition well.)
It has nothing to do with her gender.

259
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
Mind your own business

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,390
before worrying about others'.

261
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,390
If you treat her as your enemy,

262
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,000
(You've been deceived.)
then you don't need to follow me anymore.

263
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
(Yang was just unwilling to admit Smiling has changed.)
Her achievement today

264
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,200
(We make them convinced with our strength.)
results from her consistent hard work.

265
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
(She just doesn't have any skills.)
You could dislike her,

266
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,150
(Smiling is good.)
but most people in our team

267
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,860
(Who said girls didn't deserve)
respect such a rival like her.

268
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,600
(to play professional competitions?)
respect such a rival like her.

269
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,240
(Don't be deceived by her, idiot.)
Even if you dislike her, please respect her.

270
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,480
(Please show her some respect.)
Respect everything

271
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
(Her bad performance has nothing to do with respect.)
she has done for her dream of e-sports.

272
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,960
It has nothing to do with any other reasons.

273
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,360
(YQCB_AICO)
He hopes someday

274
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,360
(Well said!)
he can stand at the top of the arena

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,960
(Smiling, go for it!)
and raise the trophy we are dreaming of.

276
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,670
Before that,

277
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,000
it's ok even if he has thistles and thorns
draped around his shoulders

278
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,630
or treads on burning hot sand.

279
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,240
As the captain of ZGDX,

280
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,840
everyone expects too much from

281
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,550
and trusts him.

282
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
(These are all his duties.)
He's willing to accept the fact.

283
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,030
(He's a worthy professional player.)
He should

284
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
and must accept it.

285
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,870
(Well said. How could they
talk nonsense about her?)

286
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,270
(It's so moving that tears
keep running down my face.)

287
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,390
(Those words give much food for thought.)
What nice words!

288
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
So moving.

289
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I'm deeply inspired by them.

290
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,720
Don't worry.

291
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,150
(Just focus on your competition.)
Although it's a shame ZGDX didn't win any prizes

292
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,270
(We're on your side.)
in the national final.

293
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,790
(Keep a low profile.)
But keep in mind

294
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,150
(See you at the arena.)
that I will raise the championship trophy for Cheng.

295
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,750
Jealousy can't cause one to make progress.

296
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,750
If you have time to have a chat,

297
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,390
you may instead spend some time
improving yourselves.

298
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
See?

299
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,910
My wife made unpleasant yet wise remarks.

300
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,550
Interview?

301
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,630
(Smiling attracts me too. I'm her fan now.)

302
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,320
(Unpleasant yet wise remarks.)
I've looked at it.

303
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,120
(I'm looking forward to the day when you drape
the Five-Starred Red Flag over your shoulders.)

304
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
(Don't be affected by those bad words.)

305
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,390
Smiling is a very attractive woman.

306
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
(I want you to win.)
So

307
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,080
(When will Smiling come to have a live stream?)
luck...

308
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
How to say that phrase?

309
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,910
Luck was on Lu Sicheng's side.

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Right.

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,080
That's exactly that phrase.

312
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,550
Luck...

313
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,080
Exactly.

314
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,000
Guys,

315
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,150
we get along quite well

316
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,480
with one another.

317
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,910
So you don't need to worry about it.

318
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,630
What Tong Yao said
is just the official attitude.

319
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,240
She even used the same punctuation.

320
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,480
If you still think we don't get on well,

321
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,840
it doesn't matter

322
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,510
and won't have any effect on us.

323
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,790
Whether you're our fans

324
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,630
or haters who know what they said is false,

325
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,720
we are sure to

326
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,390
give you a satisfying answer

327
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,720
at the national competition.

328
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,480
Yeah.

329
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,390
We've said what we should say.

330
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,320
The hardships we experienced

331
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,840
will all become the light
for the road ahead of us.

332
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,080
ZGDX, come on!

333
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,600
Come on!

334
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,750
Let us drape thistles
and thorns around our shoulders

335
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,790
and tread on burning hot sand.

336
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,510
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

337
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,670
Cheers.

338
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,960
How about taking a photo of all of us?

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,030
- OK.
- OK.

340
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,600
Make space for me.

341
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,000
ZGDX, come on!

342
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,270
Cheers!

343
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
Cheers!

344
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,600
K.

345
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,150
How about having a chat with them?

346
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,600
Who is it?

347
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,150
- Don't care.
- I'm getting it.

348
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,550
Recently,

349
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,480
many people have said

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,200
I don't get along well with K.

351
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,440
Come on.

352
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,320
Cheers, bro.

353
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Cheers.

354
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,320
Hello, you've got a package.

355
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,510
Could you please sign for it?

356
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm done.

357
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,750
Thanks.

358
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,440
Thanks

359
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,790
You and I...

360
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,440
What's going on?

361
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,270
Let's go and check it out.

362
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,270
Wait a minute, guys.

363
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,080
Stand up.

364
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,080
It's so disgusting.

365
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,910
A roach was actually sent here!

366
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,030
That person must be abnormal.

367
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,720
He actually used such a lowdown trick!

368
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,510
So catty.

369
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,670
Guys.

370
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,440
There is a letter here.

371
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,670
What is written on it?

372
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,630
What does it say?

373
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,600
This is just a little punishment.

374
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,550
You're so arrogant.

375
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,510
You'd better not take part in
any competitions later.

376
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,360
It's only a short distance from
the spectator seats to the player seats.

377
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,390
Obviously, it's against Tong Yao.

378
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,150
I'm gonna hurry and take it away.

379
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
- Wait a moment.
- So disgusting.

380
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,550
I'm gonna take some photos first.

381
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
- Yeah. It's evidence.
- Evidence.

382
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,200
And this one.

383
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,200
Take a photo of it too.

384
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,440
Hello, sir.

385
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,390
I want to report something.

386
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,150
This person must be insane.

387
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,390
What feud does he have with Tong Yao?

388
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,390
He has gone too far.

389
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,870
He couldn't have done such a thing
if he's not insane.

390
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,150
It's all right. Hold it in.

391
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,630
OK.

392
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,200
There's also a roach

393
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,120
in that box.

394
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,510
Blades are a good match for the dead mice.

395
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,270
But they changed the mice to roaches.

396
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,960
I must have said I'm afraid of roaches

397
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,270
in the live room.

398
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,360
Why didn't I say

399
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,120
I had a phobia for diamonds and gold?

400
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,510
Don't talk so much,
your tears are coming out.

401
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,360
It's because of the pain.

402
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,120
You almost poured
a bottle of rubbing-alcohol on my hand.

403
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,600
Do you know how painful it is?

404
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,510
It's not as painful as my heart is.

405
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,550
Is she all right?

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,480
Leave them alone.

407
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,550
She should be all right.

408
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,870
Let's go.

409
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,320
Go.

410
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,030
Get some rest.

411
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:37,910
Cheng.

412
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,600
What?

413
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,150
There was also a threatening letter

414
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,000
in that box.

415
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,630
It reads they will make trouble for us
in the competition the day after tomorrow.

416
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,670
I've called the police.

417
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,630
I've also contacted the organizers

418
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,320
and asked them to tell their security guards
to intensify the inspection of certain people.

419
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,080
But it may not work.

420
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,120
So?

421
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,240
We mean,

422
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,480
since Tong Yao's hand is hurt,

423
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,720
for security reasons,

424
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,320
she'd better not play the competition
against Red Arrow the day after tomorrow.

425
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,960
Lu Yue can just take this opportunity
to practice playing the competition.

426
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,630
If he always plays training matches,

427
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,680
I'm afraid he won't be able to keep up with us

428
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,640
when he takes turns to play the competition.

429
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,200
No. We have no reason
for not having her play the competition.

430
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,030
Safety first.

431
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,880
Although her hand wasn't hurt badly,

432
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,510
it's her hand after all.

433
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
(Shield Disappeared)

434
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,110
(God's Envoy)

435
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,750
The mages and supporters of
Red Arrow like to follow junglers.

436
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,000
Then when they reach the sixth level,
they will watch for shooter.

437
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,790
You and Cat's tactics

438
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,310
have almost been studied completely.

439
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,160
So next time use some new tactics.

440
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,550
Ok.

441
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,400
Ok.

442
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,350
I've got something to say.

443
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,480
Because of what happened just now,

444
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,790
the club has noticed that

445
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,270
Tong Yao won't take part in

446
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,160
the competition against Red Arrow tomorrow

447
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,160
for the time being for security reasons.

448
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,000
Lu Yue will be the starting player.

449
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,680
Tong Yao, you agreed?

450
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,880
I think it's ok.

451
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
Lu Yue can take this opportunity
to practice new shikigamis.

452
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,830
It may be useful in the competition later.

453
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,510
Besides, the club made this decision
for safety concerns.

454
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,750
Since she's at the eye of the storm,

455
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
there's no need for her to save face

456
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,550
without regard to her own safety.

457
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Besides, I've discussed with Rui
about this matter.

458
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,160
We plan not to announce this

459
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,030
for fear that others will follow suit.

460
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,350
Then I'm not the only one who has hard luck.

461
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,510
Moreover, I don't want my fans
to worry about me either.

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,790
Then there will be inevitably
many rumors about me again.

463
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,550
Why did Cheng leave?

464
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,200
What's going on?

465
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,720
He's angry.

466
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,240
Are you all right?

467
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,550
Although this decision upsets you very much,

468
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,720
there's nothing else we can do now.

469
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,440
I also understand the management.

470
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't blame them for it.

471
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,880
You're just a little girl.

472
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,510
If something really happens to you,

473
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,000
we will be too embarrassed
to explain the matter to your family.

474
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,640
Don't worry.

475
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,680
I'm all right.

476
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
(Sent to Lu Sicheng)
(Where are you?)

477
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,880
(Come back.)

478
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,160
(Sent to Lu Sicheng)
(I'm all right.)

479
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,310
(I'm just taking a break
from the competition.)

480
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,680
(It's not a ban.)

481
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,270
(It's ok if I can't take part in it.)

482
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,440
(There's nothing for me
to have a grievance about.)

483
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,680
(Although I'm a professional player)

484
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,680
(and my only job is to play in the competition,)

485
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,550
(fans are)

486
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,350
(inevitable accessories.)

487
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,750
(Sometimes you'll find them annoying.)

488
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,550
(Why don't they just disappear?)

489
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,960
(But sometimes,)

490
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,440
(if we are at the lowest point in our career,)

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,270
(our fans will happen to)

492
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,790
(support us from places)

493
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,000
(where we don't necessarily see them.)

494
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,160
(There's no real all-or-nothing situation
in this world.)

495
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,550
(For example,)

496
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,240
(when I was given an interview that day,)

497
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,310
(it's just because my fans were with me)

498
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,920
(that I had the guts)

499
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,790
(to say those things.)

500
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,270
(I don't regret it now either.)

501
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,310
(Just forget it.)

502
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,240
(I don't know what the hell I am talking about.)

503
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,920
I want to ask you something.

504
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,790
Say it.

505
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,440
Who on earth was Cheng angry with

506
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,510
when he slammed something down this afternoon?

507
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,750
Figure it out yourself.

508
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,310
I'm asking the wrong person!

509
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,000
(Sorry,)

510
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,590
(the number you just dialed)

511
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,270
(is not available.)

512
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,830
(Sent to Lu Sicheng)
(Why are you upset?)

513
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,440
(I don't want to see the headline
on the newspaper)

514
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,480
(that some professional player
leap the sea level in a luxury car)

515
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,880
(and sank it to the seabed in anger,
and in the end, he became fish's food.)

516
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,790
(Can you come back or not?)

517
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,700
(Jinyang)

518
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,720
Tong Yao, you haven't gone to sleep, have you?

519
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,720
How's your hand?

520
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,640
I've just come back from home in the morning.

521
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,680
I thought you were dead

522
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,830
since you hadn't taken my calls
for such a long time.

523
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm all right.

524
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,720
I just went to fetch my cat's nest.

525
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,750
So I didn't see your call.

526
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,440
Cat's nest?

527
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,440
What for?

528
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,830
To let them sleep with me.

529
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,350
The last time you slept with the cats

530
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,070
can date back to that evening

531
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,590
when you and Jian Yang broke up.

532
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,200
No more pretending to be strong.

533
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,480
You think you are the heroine in a K-drama?

534
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm really fine.

535
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,160
So don't worry about me.

536
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,920
Ok. I'll chat with you when I go back.

537
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,590
Stop!

538
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,680
Don't fight.

539
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,640
(Sent to Lu Sicheng)
(I'm sleepy.)

540
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,550
(But my hand hurts.)

541
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,200
(I want you to hug me while I'm sleeping.)

542
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,960
What time is it?

543
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,000
3:00 a.m.

544
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,680
Why are you back so late?

545
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,400
I was worried about you.

546
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,310
Just sleep.

547
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
(Everyone, we welcome you)

548
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,030
(to the second round of ZGDX vs. Red Arrow)

549
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,640
(in the National League)

550
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,510
(of the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

551
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,720
(Now the score is 1-0.)

552
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,440
(Chase him! Chase him! Well done.)

553
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,920
(Today ZGDX has a new midsolo, Lu Yue.)

554
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,640
(We still got the opportunity.)

555
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,720
(They also have a new commander K.
He's gonna lead the team.)

556
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,270
(They're always harassing me.)

557
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,000
(Chessman, however, is playing so cruelly.)

558
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,110
(He's either striking someone suddenly,)

559
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,750
(or on the way to do that.)

560
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,350
(The enemies are hit so badly that
they've nearly run out of blood.)

561
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,720
(Yeah! Ares, retreat!)

562
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,780
(First Blood)
(But Chessman didn't give him the opportunity)

563
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,750
(and killed him right away.)

564
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,480
Good job.

565
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,400
Lu Yue, never use the second skill
too often to clear the line.

566
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,960
If you lose too much blood, you'll be defeated

567
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,400
when the jungler opposite attacks you.

568
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,110
What the hell!

569
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,270
I got beaten up so badly.

570
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,750
I don't even have time to clear the line.

571
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,830
The jungler opposite is gone.

572
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,550
Lu Yue, watch out!

573
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm stressed out because of Shiro Douji.

574
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,070
After you pull down the enemies' defense turrets,
hurry to come to me.

575
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,160
Then the enemies will be scared.

576
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,550
The captain is pulling down
the enemies' defense turrets.

577
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,920
So we can't come to you.

578
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,030
K, call the jungler.

579
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,160
Cat, watch for someone on the middle lane.

580
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,110
Watch for someone on the middle lane?

581
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,400
Lu Yue, you sell it.

582
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,030
Not too deep.

583
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,790
Ok.

584
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,110
Why is the jungler opposite ready to attack us

585
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,400
since we've changed the midsolo?

586
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,000
Cat, what do you mean?

587
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,380
(Invincible Warrior)

588
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,830
Chessman directly killed
two people at the bottom lane.

589
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,550
He really did a good job today
in the bottom lane.

590
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,030
Lu Yue.

591
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,030
Pay attention to your Teleport.

592
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,160
Try to deceive Shiro Douji.

593
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,830
Ok.

594
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,000
There's no need to rush.

595
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,750
Let's just wait for him to come up a little.

596
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,830
Come up a little.

597
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,000
(He deliberately went forward
to be attacked by Shiro Douji.)

598
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,400
(Sure enough,)

599
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,350
(after he took the bait...)

600
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,480
- I can't move.
- Steady yourself.

601
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,960
I can't move.

602
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,750
(Defeat)
(Shiro Douji still insists on killing Lv.)

603
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,400
Come back. Retreat.

604
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,960
(They deliberately tempted
the three people of Red Arrow to chase them.)

605
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,260
- Attack.
(- Sure enough,)

606
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,070
- Attack.
(- the Red Arrow is deceived.)

607
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,510
(The three of them are fought back
by the three people of ZGDX.)

608
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,720
(ZGDX's score has changed
to three points successfully.)

609
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

610
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,720
Well done.

611
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,070
You did a really good job.

612
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,750
(Now the competition
has been going on for 30 minutes.)

613
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,550
(ZGDX has the upper hand.)

614
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
(It will all depend on the team fight.)

615
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,550
The topsolo and shooter opposite
are going to support on the middle lane.

616
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,350
You hide yourselves well.

617
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm gonna come from the jungle.

618
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,200
Why must all of us
help Lu Yue with the team fight

619
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,550
when he's guarding the middle lane?

620
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,480
I'm the core.

621
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,510
So you should protect me.

622
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,720
Chubby, you attack first.

623
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,510
OK.

624
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,030
I've joined the team fight and have attacked.

625
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,790
Captain, don't go forward.

626
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,960
(Shield Disappeared)
(Chessman's tactics)

627
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,480
(Defeat)
(are so wonderful.)

628
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,880
(He killed one of his enemies instantly.)

629
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,350
(Defeat)
Sealed.

630
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,240
Double Kill.

631
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,510
(Triple Kill)
(Oh! Triple Kill.)

632
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,550
(Anything else?)

633
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,960
(- Quadra Kill)
(- Ultra Kill. Can he get penta-kill?)

634
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,880
He has good performance.

635
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,720
(Can he get penta-kill?)

636
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,500
Penta Kill

637
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,510
Penta Kill.

638
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,000
Penta Kill Ace.

639
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,480
Chessman did a very good job.

640
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,590
Chessman is awesome!

641
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,480
Cheng is so amazing.

642
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,400
We finally are going to
pull down the base turret.

643
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,400
(ZGDX is working together
to pull down the base turret.)

644
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,440
(Chessman stands a little forward.)

645
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,140
(Defeat)

646
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,070
(Congratulations to Chessman.)

647
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,070
(Congratulations to ZGDX.)

648
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,550
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)
(Cheng played too aggressively just now.)

649
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,960
(He played so irritably.)

650
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,070
(It seemed that somehow)

651
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,270
(it looked like he was going to eat someone.)

652
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,350
I think he played in a bad mood.

653
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
He attacked many times
when he shouldn't do it.

654
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,200
He's too impulsive.

655
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,790
It seemed that he was angry with someone.

656
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,110
What happened?

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,480
They changed
the midsolo starting player today.

658
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,110
Does it have anything to with that?

659
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,400
Maybe.

660
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,680
Will he

661
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,790
spill the beans later?

662
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,510
- Won't he retort...
- Good.

663
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,310
when answering the host's stupid questions?

664
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,350
He can't.

665
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,550
He's not coming.

666
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,350
Everyone, I'm very sorry to inform you that

667
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,000
today's MVP interview is canceled.

668
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,790
The captain of ZGDX Chessman

669
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,830
refused our invitation.

670
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,960
Thanks.

671
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
- Why?
- Why did he refuse?

672
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,220
Could you tell us the reason?

673
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,270
- What on earth happened?
- Could you give us an explanation?

674
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:02,660
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

675
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,350
Here comes the bus.

676
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,920
Hurry up.

677
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,240
- Come on.
- We must get the news source.

678
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,750
Hurry up.

679
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,310
Rui, may I interview you?

680
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,310
Excuse me.

681
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,920
Could you please say something?

682
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
Chessman, could you please give an interview?

683
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,680
Could you please say something?

684
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,720
Today, in the arena,

685
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,790
you played the contest

686
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,720
in a very bad mood.

687
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,880
After the contest,
you also refused the MVP interview.

688
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,160
Could you explain it in person?

689
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,550
Cheng.

690
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,200
I heard that you secured the MVP reward twice

691
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
in today's contest.

692
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,350
But you refused the interview after the contest.

693
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,110
No one has ever done that
like this before in the Pro League.

694
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,270
Someone said
you were very emotional in the contest.

695
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,000
Is that true?

696
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,350
What's the point of these questions?

697
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,310
We all know that

698
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,960
Smiling didn't take part in the contest today.

699
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,000
For this matter,

700
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,480
there has been
no official explanation until now.

701
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,830
Why?

702
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,110
Which team have you seen

703
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,480
sent a post on Weibo when
they intended to change their members?

704
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,960
Did the club suspend Tong Yao temporarily

705
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,880
because of her sass last week?

706
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,160
Is this her punishment?

707
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,750
No.

708
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
That Lu Yue replaced her in today's contest

709
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,310
is just to prepare for
the World Championships.

710
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,750
And Tong Yao

711
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,550
has done well in everything,

712
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,510
until now

713
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,590
as a professional player,

714
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,510
except the time when she fought with others.

715
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,790
Whether I or the club,

716
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,110
we all have no reason to punish her.

717
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,960
Explain it.

718
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,160
Could you please say something?

719
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Have you asked enough?

720
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,240
No one asks these kinds of questions

721
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
at the doors of the clubs.

722
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,720
Will you step aside?

723
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,030
Everyone.

724
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,830
I don't have a problem
with you writing a report.

725
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,440
But you should be careful

726
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,480
with the title

727
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,750
and the content.

728
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,680
Especially for some e-sports media.

729
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,350
Like the bloody E-sports Industry Farm!

730
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,160
If I see you make up things,

731
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,030
even punctuation,

732
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,550
to catch people's attention,

733
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,070
we'll sue you

734
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,510
to the extent that
you will lose all of your money.

735
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,550
How could he say that?

736
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,110
They were not like this before.

737
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,310
What happened to them?

738
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,270
What's going on?

739
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,310
Cheng, you're back.

740
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,240
Cheng.

741
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,830
Cheng.

742
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,590
I watched the contest.

743
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,440
Why did you play so aggressively?

744
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,750
Were you possessed by Hierophant?

745
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,480
What's wrong with you?

746
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,400
A headache,

747
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,270
stomachache, or a cold?

748
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,000
No.

749
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,160
Then why didn't you accept

750
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,720
the MVP interview?

751
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,590
Or did you look at the comments online?

752
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,720
What comments?

753
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,640
Someone says that

754
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,400
you're dissatisfied with
the punishment the club gave to me.

755
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,670
So you played the contest angrily

756
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,630
and refused the interview after the contest,

757
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,800
in protest.

758
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,710
Of course

759
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,400
I know it's not like that.

760
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,590
- You couldn't have...
- I'm dissatisfied indeed.

761
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,510
But not with the club.

762
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,230
Don't wait me

763
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,190
for dinner.

764
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,400
Sorry, I was stuck in traffic.

765
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,400
It's for you.

766
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,480
What's wrong?

767
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,630
You're unhappy?

768
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,190
Say it.

769
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,670
Cheng has been acting very strange recently.

770
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
You really observe keenly

771
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,230
as his girlfriend!

772
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,510
Love, even the journalists outside

773
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,320
know this!

774
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,000
Since he slammed the door and went out,

775
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,440
he's been quiet

776
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,150
and gloomy.

777
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,360
Whatever I say to him,

778
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,230
he looks like

779
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,280
he's not interested in it.

780
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,190
He even rarely spoke to me.

781
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,150
He was absent-minded

782
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,440
even when he put his arm around my shoulder.

783
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,590
I asked him the reason.

784
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,920
But he didn't say anything.

785
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
He just started playing games madly.

786
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,030
These days,

787
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,670
I have said "I'm all right" so many times

788
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,630
that I almost broke my lips.

789
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
But it didn't work on him at all.

790
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,110
I even began to suspect that

791
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,920
he was dissatisfied with me.

792
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,760
He was just silent,
irritable and refused to cooperate with me.

793
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,670
That's indeed his way of behaving.

794
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,670
I really don't know what to do.

795
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,360
He said in the morning

796
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,000
he was dissatisfied.

797
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,150
But not with the club.

798
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
Could it be with me?

799
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,760
It's difficult for us to read his mind.

800
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,360
He's never been like this before.

801
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
He just focused on the contest before.

802
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,230
Now that you mention it, it's true.

803
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,800
It seems that after you joined the team,

804
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,230
he has changed indeed.

805
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,960
You think it's because of me too?

806
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,630
Don't make any wild guesses about it.

807
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,590
You're doing the same thing again.

808
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,400
When you saw Jian Yang have fun in the KTV

809
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,880
and ignored you,

810
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,550
you proposed breaking up with him
since you couldn't bear it.

811
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
You're behaving like that again!

812
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,000
I can't be bothered to criticize you.

813
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,480
What a funny thing!

814
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,630
Jian Yang really

815
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,070
did something unpleasant to you.

816
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360
But what about Cheng?

817
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,620
He didn't do anything that shows

818
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,440
it's you who makes him unhappy.
It's all your imagination.

819
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm just saying.

820
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,960
Cheng

821
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,710
always focused on the competition.

822
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,110
It seems that I forcibly
pull him from the altar

823
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,280
and let him experience the unpleasant things.

824
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,360
At least those fan girls

825
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,280
are right about this.

826
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,190
Unpleasant things!

827
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,510
I'm really envious of
these young lovers like you.

828
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,760
I'm also envious of
the mentality of you two

829
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,630
flattering each other and loving each other.

830
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,190
I think Cheng

831
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,960
is just dissatisfied with himself.

832
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,800
So he is upset and avoids you.

833
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,400
Sometimes men

834
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,000
are much stronger than we can imagine.

835
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,190
But their mysterious self-esteem

836
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,400
is much weaker.

837
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,440
Maybe

838
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,110
he's hiding somewhere you can't see,

839
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,150
hitting his head against the wall.

840
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,190
He may blame himself

841
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,440
just for your little wound.

842
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
Little wound?

843
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,710
It's obviously a big wound.

844
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,760
I even got an injection against tetanus for it

845
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,030
and had a nightmare all night.

846
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,760
Are you a caring person or not?

847
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,070
It's impossible for me to break up with him.

848
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,320
Besides, I am no match for him at fighting.

849
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,440
So I can only imagine things.

850
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,630
I'm too helpless.

851
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,630
You're quite aware of that!

852
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,070
It's all because he ignored me.

853
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,280
My hand hurts.

854
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,070
But he didn't care about it.

855
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,760
He didn't know that it's painful?

856
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,280
By the way.

857
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,920
One more thing.

858
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,510
He was missing for a whole day.

859
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,880
He didn't reply
when I sent him messages on WeChat.

860
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,760
It turned out the next morning

861
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,590
that he secretly got into my bed

862
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,800
and hugged me when he was sleeping.

863
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,480
You just complained about him,

864
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,150
why are you suddenly showing off your love?

865
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,840
Nonsense.

866
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,630
He disappeared and reappeared

867
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,840
whenever he liked.

868
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,280
