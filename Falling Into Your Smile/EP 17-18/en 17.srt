00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,030
(E-sports players spend
most of their time in silence)

2
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,550
(tapping away at their keyboards.)

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,000
(So they often forget)

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,200
(that they're public figures, too.)

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,340
=Episode 18=

7
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,760
Hello?

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
(Yao, you had a fight with someone?)

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,070
(Are you okay?)

10
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,560
(Here, let me talk.)

11
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,000
Yao.

12
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,200
(When you're away from home,)

13
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,000
(you must protect yourself.)

14
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,920
(Don't get into trouble with others.)

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Mom, Dad.

16
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm fine.

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
I know. Don't worry about me.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,800
I'll be careful next time.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,360
I have something going on, talk next time.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,190
How is it?

21
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,120
Do you feel good?

22
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,430
I'll go post an apology right now
on the official Weibo account

23
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,630
and then stick it on top.

24
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,680
Then I'll go back to my dark room
and reflect on myself.

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Well, not all things

26
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,710
can be resolved with

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,310
being angry in society.

28
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,630
The punishment that the club gave you

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,590
actually isn't too bad.

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,910
That's not bad?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
Banning me from a game at this stage?

32
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,280
The punishment can be big or small.

33
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,030
A ban or a fine

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,910
is not important.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,910
Just one game.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,030
Now this is hot and trending.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
If it is really gets to the level of

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,430
the image of e-sports

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
and it's made known to the tournament host,

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,310
do you think a ban for one game

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,470
will be enough?

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
Cheng.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,780
(Next Gen Anime Expo Event
Execution Flow Sheet)

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
What is it now?
Aren't we all spoiled little princesses

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,430
of our parents?

46
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,030
She deserved to be slapped for being rude.

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,470
You'd be punished anyway.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Why didn't you give her another slap?

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,080
Don't fan the flames.

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,430
She can't mess with this.

51
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,360
Haven't you read the public opinions online?

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,680
I saw.

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,400
That's why I said

54
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,190
it's a loss not to give her another slap.

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,400
If women can't

56
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,840
sanction women,

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,750
then aren't these people
going to be out of control?

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Why do we have to speak of
personal quality with people like them?

59
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,280
I really can't stand these girl fans,

60
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,190
always making unreasonable demands.

61
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,240
They think they can do whatever they want

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
just because they spend money?

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,430
Actually.

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,150
What?

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
Your female fans are not aggressive enough?

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,870
No, no, no.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,270
Mulan,

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,600
what's with your breathless

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,630
and upset attitude

70
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,510
as if you were banned for life?

71
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,950
Our captain is so angry.

72
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,510
Why is he angry?

73
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,240
Last time, he was trying to convince me

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,630
to behave well.

75
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,950
Don't lead the public opinion myself.

76
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,120
We just had the talk.

77
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,630
And now I'm banned from the game.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,270
That's quite bad.

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
If I were your captain,

80
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,000
I guess I'd also be furious as well.

81
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,240
But why didn't you explain?

82
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,950
You're just going to
take all this in silence?

83
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,510
It's not that I don't want to explain.

84
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,600
It'll just seem like I'm quibbling
no matter what I say.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,830
It doesn't help.

86
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,510
And it's Mrs. Lu.

87
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,870
Mrs. Lu.

88
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,310
Lu Sicheng's mother.

89
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
What can I say?

90
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,920
What do I dare to say?

91
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,560
Look! Look!

92
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,510
It's already been posted.

93
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,510
(Penalty for Tong Yao's violation
Banned for one game.)

94
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,540
(Two months' salary and
all bonuses deducted.)

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
Tong Yao.

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,390
You've got quite some
ups and downs in your career.

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,510
Shut up!

98
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,240
What did your club PR say?

99
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,390
Just let your post hang like this?

100
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,040
What can I say?

101
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,600
If I apologize, I have to do it
with a good attitude.

102
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,510
It's only normal for my post to hang there.

103
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,310
Look at this.

104
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,430
Here is another video.

105
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,000
The so-called truth.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,140
What's going on?

107
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,630
(Don't tell me)

108
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
(our Tong Yao got her salary deducted)

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,430
(because she refused)

110
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,040
(the Princess hugging interactive part)

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,000
(and pissed off
some show girls who wanted to)

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,040
(get into the players' arms.)
- Tong Yao.

113
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,830
(- What are you playing at?)
- Your chance has come!

114
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,040
Who sent the video of Comic-Con?

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,120
What video?

116
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,240
Not me. I didn't go that day.

117
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,040
I was holding you back.

118
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,070
Where do I get the time to
take care of such details?

119
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,510
It's probably a staff member,

120
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,950
good at leading the public opinion,

121
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,120
in charge of everything.

122
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,480
In an instant, the public opinion

123
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,480
is lying in the charge of him.

124
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
Awesome.

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,040
Welcome to my world.

126
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,800
Whoever sent it,

127
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,310
you're my hero.

128
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,600
And about what happened the other day,

129
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,510
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've brought to you guys.

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,190
I apologize.

131
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
Don't say that.

132
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,510
Don't. I'll live a few years less for that.

133
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,070
Who is the hero?

134
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,190
- Who is it?
- Come forward.

135
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe our midsolo

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,560
would be so excited and marry him.

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,920
Ha, I knew it! For someone so far-sighted

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,270
and who can win from a thousand miles away,
that must be our…

139
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you guys have way too much time?

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,680
Train. We have a match tomorrow.

141
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,190
Are you still angry?

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,360
Who?

143
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,270
- Everyone.
- Mind your own business.

144
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,600
Our neighbor wants to play a training match.

145
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,040
You guys get ready.

146
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
If you play well today, I'll buy you dinner.

147
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,750
Let Lu Yue play

148
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,160
in tomorrow's match with Obsidian.

149
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,070
Lu Yue should play
in the training match later too.

150
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,240
Let him warm up his hands.

151
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,830
Come on.

152
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,160
Give me Ootengu.

153
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,070
I want Ootengu.

154
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Besides Ootengu and Higanbana,

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,390
can't you pick someone else?

156
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,600
Such as Marisha Ray, Aoandou,

157
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,750
or Enenra.

158
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,360
He only know how to play
these two shikigamis.

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,270
The one banned from the game

160
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,510
and the one who's retired,
can you guys be quiet?

161
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,950
No one uses the shikigamis you mentioned

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,270
during the tournament.

163
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,270
What's the point of practicing them?

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,190
Others don't use them. You can.

165
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,720
Sometimes the pattern is more important
than the version.

166
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,600
See?

167
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,630
Your opponent has chosen Enenra.

168
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,630
Think about it.

169
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,390
When you play Enenra,

170
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,430
which one they pick

171
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,190
will annoy you the most?

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,120
Cheng, give him Oitsukigami.

173
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,830
Even if you are a substitute,

174
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,430
you were at least a pro

175
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,430
who played full games
for two seasons last year.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,160
You have to let Tong Yao

177
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
tell you what to choose?

178
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,190
How come?

179
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,750
Did you hear that, Cheng?

180
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,200
Oitsukigami.

181
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,680
Follow me, Enenra.

182
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,850
Follow me to chase Oitsukigami.

183
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,460
Salute.

184
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,550
Go, go, go.

185
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,270
He's still ignoring you?

186
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,150
K, Cat, go to the top lane.

187
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
- Yes.
- Yes, sir!

188
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Don't just go to the top lane.

189
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,550
Come and take care of your midsolo, too.

190
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,960
Cat, I'll help you
cross the top lane early.

191
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,030
He is worried about you.

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,720
I sat next to him at dinner today.

193
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,910
I saw

194
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,960
him delete the video

195
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,080
of the program in his phone.

196
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,630
He asked me not to tell anyone.

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,510
What do you mean?

198
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,510
Quick, help me!

199
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
No matter what you think,

200
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,030
Lu Sicheng is first and foremost
the captain of this team.

201
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,630
He has the obligation to protect
each and every one of you,

202
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,550
and protect the team from trouble.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,630
Last year when this kid was in trouble,

204
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,000
he also did a lot

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
to keep it down.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,390
He was punished with a temporary ban.

207
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,910
If this kind of thing goes too far,

208
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,480
a lifetime ban is possible.

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,080
So,

210
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,870
there are some things he can't help you,

211
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,240
nor can he teach you.

212
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,870
Don't rely on him too much.

213
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,510
Understand?

214
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,790
Tong Yao.

215
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,910
You need to know

216
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,240
understanding yourself

217
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,320
- is the only way to really understand.
- Lu Yue.

218
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,320
I've been attacked!

219
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,910
A bunch of troubled kids

220
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,360
are always creating trouble for the captain.

221
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,030
It's okay.

222
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't think too much. It'll all pass.

223
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Hold on, hold on.

224
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,390
Don't get yourself killed, man.

225
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,360
Can you not be so grumpy?

226
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
Where is our midsolo?

227
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,270
Are you really settled to be a loser?

228
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,000
Shut up, I'm about to take off
once fully equipped.

229
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,030
I'm starving to death.

230
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,670
Can we still finish the game?

231
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,670
Come to the middle lane to push the line.

232
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,240
Leading the line alone,
are you waiting to be caught?

233
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm coming!

234
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Pick up a team fight.

235
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,910
Go, go, go!

236
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,270
- Ultimate skill prepared.
- Go, go, go.

237
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,870
Chubby, save your ultimate skill for me.

238
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Lu Yue.

239
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,790
Where are you? Go.

240
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,510
Midsolo. Go.

241
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
One more! One more!

242
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Just one more! Just one more!

243
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,150
Go, go, go!

244
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
(Victory)

245
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,150
- Yes!
- Nice! Yes!

246
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,510
How's that, Tong Yao?

247
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
It's not a bad game, right?

248
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Ignoring your Master level
in the early stage of the match,

249
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,240
you destroy the turret
quite quickly with Oitsukigami.

250
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,320
This feels like

251
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,510
watching my own pup grow up.

252
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
What?

253
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,000
The first time we beat him in an instant.

254
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
The second time we won with ease.

255
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,080
The third time we felt a little resistance.

256
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,840
The fourth time we felt difficult.

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Now we're about 50-50.

258
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,960
You guys, wake up.

259
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,600
Next time when we meet our neighboring team,

260
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,750
it's possible that we won't win.

261
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,840
Can you say something nice?

262
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,600
Something nice?

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,720
Sure.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,360
From now on, during work time,

265
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
whoever is caught playing Connect the Dots,

266
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,080
browsing through Weibo and reading comics

267
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,670
will get his or her salary deducted.

268
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,270
Do you hear that?

269
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,870
Going to the gym is okay, right?

270
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
What about mahjong? It's also a competition.

271
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,790
Mahjong is also not allowed.

272
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,150
That's national culture.

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,510
Can you be more professional?

274
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
I usually watch videos of games

275
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
and occasionally play backgammon

276
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,150
on a break.

277
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,270
That's madness.

278
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,240
Can we please stop talking?

279
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm starving.

280
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,550
Me, too.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,630
Well, let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

282
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,670
Okay, let's go.

283
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,080
Let's go, let's eat.

284
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,320
- I'm starving.
- Let's go.

285
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,600
Tong Yao, what are you doing?

286
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm not going.

287
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,720
You guys go ahead. I'm not hungry.

288
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,510
I'll go live streaming later.

289
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
I'm running out on my salary
with all the deduction.

290
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm not in the mood to spend money.

291
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,240
Hundreds of thousands for one push,
isn't it expensive?

292
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,320
Why not buy a few purses with that money,

293
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,390
or buy a few dresses to have fun.

294
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Okay, go ahead.

295
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,080
I'll bring you something nice
when I come back.

296
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Behave yourself in your live streaming.

297
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,440
Don't talk nonsense again.

298
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,240
I know, I know.

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,080
Bye-bye.

300
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,320
Hello.

301
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,080
I just ordered the congee. Is it ready?

302
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,150
Very soon, sir.

303
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,080
Thank you.

304
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,390
Is it on mute?

305
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,670
Why are the fans getting all hyped

306
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,750
while Tong Yao is not talking?

307
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,910
I guess she's really learned her lesson.

308
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
She's practicing hard.

309
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,870
That's true.

310
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,510
She wouldn't be so quiet before.

311
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,510
Your congee is ready, sir.

312
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,240
Thank you.

313
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,630
I'm going back now.

314
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,910
Let's go back together
when we're done eating.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,870
The congee will get fishy if it gets cold.

316
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,750
You guys eat.

317
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,480
Cat.

318
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,480
Do you understand what Cheng did just now?

319
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,030
What's there to wonder?

320
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,390
Cheng just didn't have enough to eat.

321
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,870
(Why did you hit others?)

322
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,080
(Why did you get into a fight?)

323
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,480
(How dare a professional player
who got into a fight)

324
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,750
(still come to live streaming?)

325
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,390
(I don't know why you girl fans)

326
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
(like to cheer for that.)

327
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,840
(Smiling indeed hit someone.)

328
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,390
(So what if she was defending her teammates?)

329
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,750
(These players earn up to
a million yuan a year.)

330
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,790
(How miserable can they
be to play an interactive game?)

331
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,480
(Pretentious and petty.)

332
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
This user "A passerby".

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,840
Wait a minute, don't block him yet.

334
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,840
Let him speak.

335
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,600
Players earn
hundreds of thousands of yuan a year.

336
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,480
Did they eat your food or spend your money?

337
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,440
Playing professionally is
not a monkey selling art.

338
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,480
We can't call it off
if we're not feeling well?

339
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,510
(That's non-sense.)

340
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,240
(A group of Internet addicts.)

341
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,270
(You can easily earn so much
money and still be petulant)

342
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,630
(playing a few games.)

343
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,510
Earn so much money easily?

344
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,630
Then you should come, too.

345
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,750
Come on, come on. Don't wait.

346
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,960
Now the clubs are all
still recruiting for youth training.

347
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,080
Who's stopping you?

348
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,240
(What's wrong with doing an activity?)

349
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,670
(Everyone else can do it.)

350
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,960
Say you have a heart condition,

351
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,320
and your P.E. teacher asks you

352
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,480
to run for 1,500 meters.

353
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,270
Will you go?

354
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,120
Others can run, but you can't?

355
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
(I saw Chubby and them
all did it in the end.)

356
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
(They were also holding those show girls,)

357
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
(smiling happily.)

358
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,120
What? Should they cry instead?

359
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,030
(If you really don't want to do it,)

360
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
(then what's the use of ZGDX staff?)

361
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,000
(Have a team member to bear all this.)

362
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,600
(You were being used and you
continued to defend them.)

363
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,510
(Are you happy to be punished
for what you did today?)

364
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Yes.

365
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,840
I'm very happy.

366
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,150
Honestly,

367
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,630
I don't regret

368
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,320
insisting on not doing this game at all.

369
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,150
It wasn't suitable.

370
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,080
What's wrong?

371
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,320
We only learned about it

372
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,390
after we got there.

373
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,790
It was a temporary notice.

374
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,240
I don't blame

375
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,150
Rui for not being able to refuse it.

376
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,910
Honestly,

377
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,550
the only thing I regret is

378
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,030
this has caused a lot of trouble

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
for my teammates as well as the club.

380
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,910
They took a lot of the heat with me.

381
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,320
I shouldn't have rushed over there.

383
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,120
There were so many people there.

384
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,390
I should have just…

385
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,550
So fast.

386
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,720
(You're so cool.)

387
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,600
I made a mistake, really.

388
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,320
I should have gently

389
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,390
communicated with the organizer

390
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,030
about the situation.

391
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,240
That's right.

392
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,270
Because some of the team members

393
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,390
had just finished physical therapy.

394
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,360
They really couldn't do strenuous exercise.

395
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,630
It's definitely possible

396
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,320
to communicate with everyone

397
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,910
and discuss the solution.

398
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,390
Yes, we are all civilized people.

399
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,030
Chat-room manager,
please give this "A passerby"

400
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,480
a small red flower.

401
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,360
I think he was right to scold me.

402
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,440
I also think I was too impulsive.

403
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,910
Yes, yes, yes.

404
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,150
Like a shrew.

405
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,240
A real shrew.

406
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,910
I really shouldn't have done it.

407
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,510
I shouldn't have done it.

408
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,630
No small red flower?

409
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,630
Forget it.

410
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,440
Thank you, Cheng.

411
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,670
(Your eyes are about to fall out,)

412
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,590
(and stick on him, anchor.)

413
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,960
(You turn your face around
faster than you turn a page.)

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,350
Stop it.

415
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,720
Captain Lu Sicheng

416
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,640
hasn't spoken to me all day.

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's as if I've fallen into a cold hell.

418
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,310
I haven't found a way to save myself yet.

419
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm now still in the depths of hell.

420
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Coax him?

421
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,590
Do you think he's still 3 years old?

422
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,830
How?

423
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,830
Coax him.

424
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,550
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,350
He plays well with Hakurou.

426
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,200
He makes me shiver
from a thousand miles away.

427
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,510
This man said he was going to
report me to Cheng's room.

428
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,310
Where is the chat-room manager?

429
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,640
Block him.

430
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,920
This kind of people who
sows harmony between teammates

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,310
should be banned to set an example.

432
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,510
(Stop it, you fool.)

433
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,110
(Five minutes ago, the system prompted that)

434
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,680
(Lu Sicheng has entered
your live streaming room)

435
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,240
(while you were still blabbering.)

436
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,640
(You want to be killed?)

437
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,350
Everything I said was a joke.

438
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,110
I'm going to make a self-reflection now.

439
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,920
Next week at the regular meeting on Monday,

440
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,640
I'll deliver my 10,000-word

441
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
self-reflection speech with sincerity.

442
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
Okay, I'm going to
go write my self-reflection.

443
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,350
Off the air. Bye.

444
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,580
(Live streaming ends)

445
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,640
Idiot.

446
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,070
I'm so annoyed.

447
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,790
Will Lu Yue plot to usurp my throne

448
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,310
by this opportunity

449
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
and I'll be downgraded

450
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,550
to shiver by the water dispenser
for the rest of my life,

451
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
where no one will care for me in the team?

452
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,790
The only time my teammates will think of me

453
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
is when they order takeout.

454
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,550
Who's free to order takeout?

455
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Your teammates

456
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,480
talk so much that
they even want to talk to the air.

457
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,720
Why would they leave you alone
to guard the water dispenser?

458
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,830
I think you're just hungry.

459
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,510
The captain brought you some congee, right?

460
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,920
Go to sleep when you're full.

461
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
The ban will be over after one game.

462
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,160
You may still be the starting player.

463
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,550
The captain won't be able to
ignore you for life.

464
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,680
Really?

465
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,590
Didn't your club already issued

466
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,590
the announcement?

467
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,480
How can it be fake?

468
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,200
That's not what I'm asking.

469
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,110
Think about it.

470
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,680
If he really decides

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,680
not to talk to someone for his life,

472
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,310
why would he worry if she is hungry

473
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,510
and still brings her congee?

474
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
He'd just want to push
her head into the sewer,

475
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,880
let her eat shit till her death, okay?

476
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,070
What you care about is

477
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,030
whether the captain cares about you or not.

478
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,880
Now the whole team is involved.

479
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,240
Do all girls in love

480
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,070
go insane

481
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,110
like you?

482
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,160
I...

483
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Tong Yao?

484
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,790
Tong Yao.

485
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,310
I thought you'd be poor.

486
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,440
I didn't expect you to be so miserable.

487
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,070
What?

488
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,590
You've been kicked out by the captain
and are living on the streets?

489
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,030
We just watched you fail your live streaming.

490
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,400
You're screwed.

491
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,880
No, I'm not.

492
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,030
Where did you guys go after
the late-night supper?

493
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,270
Why did you come back so late?

494
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,350
No.

495
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,110
We didn't go anywhere.

496
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,590
We went straight back after dinner.

497
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,270
That's right.

498
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,640
Then how come Cheng...

499
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,640
Cheng said

500
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,070
he was afraid the congee
would get cold and fishy.

501
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
But now it seems

502
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,030
he was probably afraid you'd starve to death.

503
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,000
What did you say?

504
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,030
Say it again.

505
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,550
You two haven't spoken to each other yet?

506
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,880
No.

507
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,110
You two.

508
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,160
One of you is too proud.

509
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,400
The other is too arrogant.

510
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,880
Do you intend to fight for life?

511
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,350
That's nice.

512
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,480
It's hard.

513
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,350
It's hard.

514
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Very hard.

515

(For all of you on site
and in front of the screen,)

519

(good afternoon.)

520
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,160
We're now at the group match of 2020

521
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,720
Onmyoji Arena Pro League

522
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,750
between Obsidian and ZGDX.

523
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,790
- I'm Dudou.
- I'm Qiu.

524
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,830
(Let's start with)

525
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,030
(the lineup of both sides.)

526
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
(It's worth mentioning that)

527
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,680
(today, ZGDX's starting midsolo)

528
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
(is Lv.)

529
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,750
(It's been a long time)

530
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,110
(since we see Lv in the arena.)

531
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,160
Don't worry.

532
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,510
The club has already arranged it.

533
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,240
They won't discuss your ban.

534
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,510
Thank you, Rui.

535
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,110
(I always thought Lv is)

536
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
(a very capable player.)

537
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,680
(But the opponent midsolo
is also quite a good player.)

538
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,440
(Although Obsidian's record is mediocre,)

539
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,270
(this particularly player
is among the top 5 midsolos)

540
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,270
(in the professional league.)

541
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,400
I ran into this midsolo on the other side

542
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
when I was playing ranking games.

543
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,920
He can use every shikigami.

544
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,790
When it comes to Lu Yue who is only good at
a few shikigamis, it's a real problem.

545
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,640
(Smiling, Go)
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

546
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,590
There's no way they don't know

547
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,160
I got banned today.

548
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,270
Every member of ZGDX has fans.

549
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,790
Most of them are die-hard fans.

550
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,000
Their presence here

551
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,550
means they haven't given up on you.

552
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,790
I let them down.

553
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,110
No way.

554
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,480
Mr. Wang?

555
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,440
Yes.

556
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,880
We're at the scene.

557
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,110
Is Lu Yue nervous?

558
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,680
No.

559
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,440
- Really?
- Play well, Lu Yue.

560
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,750
- No problem.
- Play well, it's on you.

561
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,200
Let's see if we can beat them this time.

562
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,920
Come on, come on.

563
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,790
Test, test.

564
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,480
Okay, okay, everybody can hear, right?

565
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
I can hear you. I can hear you.

566
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,550
Okay.

567
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,510
Higanbana and Ootengu.

568
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,270
Okay.

569
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,830
Obsidian has been banned

570
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,310
Higanbana and Ootengu.

571
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,880
These are the shikigamis that Lv is good at.

572
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
(It seems that Obsidian)

573
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,920
(has also made a targeted deployment)

574
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,110
(after learning Tong Yao)

575
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,160
(was banned from one game yesterday.)

576
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,000
How cunning!

577
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,110
Yes, take a look at ZGDX.

578
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,440
They've banned Aoandou and Tamamo-no-Mae.

579
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,550
(It seems like there's going to be
a tough fight between the two midsolos.)

580
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,030
(To be honest,)

581
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,200
(I personally look forward to
this game very much.)

582
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,350
(Yes, this is also a big game)

583
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
(for ZGDX.)

584
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,680
(If they win,)

585
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,160
(they will be in the top of the group)

586
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,830
(with a grand slam for now.)

587
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,440
(To be honest, I was very confident about)

588
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,510
(their grand slam.)

589
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,440
(But)

590
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,720
(after the incident yesterday,)

591
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,110
(it's quite awkward now.)

592
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,640
(Yes, in the first few weeks,)

593
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,070
(ZGDX was in a near-perfect state.)

594
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,550
(Even Chessman)

595
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,640
(who rarely praised people)

596
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,480
(have complimented their midsolo,)

597
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,200
(saying he was very confident)

598
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,270
(about this season's competition.)

599
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,440
(Now looking back to it,)

600
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,070
(it's quite ironic.)

601
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,110
(Stop it.)

602
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,270
(Onmyoji Arena)
(We all know that player Lv from ZGDX)

603
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,510
(has always been known for
his stable operation.)

604
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,030
(But his shikigami pool)

605
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,750
(has always been criticized)

606
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,030
(because it's too shallow.)

607
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,550
(Yes, and today)

608
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,350
(Higanbana and Ootengu have been banned.)

609
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,110
(I'm curious)

610
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,030
(what kind of shikigamis he'll use today)

611
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,550
(to deal with this game.)

612
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,240
Lu Yue.

613
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,790
You can take Enenra.

614
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,790
No problem.

615
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,110
Chubby.

616
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,510
Give Lu Yue Enenra.

617
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,510
Is it my brother or me?

618
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,590
Enenra.

619
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,590
Lu Yue actually took out Enenra.

620
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,830
In this version,

621
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,750
Enenra is a very strong shikigami.

622
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,270
Especially because he can release skills

623
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,070
within a super long range,

624
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,400
consuming the opponent on the line,

625
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,960
and it is also very difficult to deal with

626
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,830
in the late-stage team fight.

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,790
Well this way,

628
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,270
I do think that Enenra is

629
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,880
(very suitable for Lv to use.)

630
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,680
(I wonder what kind of performance)

631
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,680
(they'll bring to us.)

632
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,750
(Well, now that both sides)

633
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,310
have finished choosing their shikigamis.

634
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,960
Let's take a look at

635
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,030
the finalized list of shikigamis.

636
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,240
(ZGDX's topsolo, Cat)

637
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,880
(has Karasu Tengu.)

638
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,070
(And K is using Yasha.)

639
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,720
(The midsolo Lv has Enenra.)

640
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,310
(For the shooter position,
Chessman has Hakurou.)

641
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,270
(Chubby has Ichimoku Ren as assist.)

642
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,400
(Look at the Obsidian side,)

643
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,590
(the topsolo is Hououka,
the jungler is Itsumade.)

644
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,270
(The midsolo is Marisha Ray.)

645
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,030
(The laners on the bottom lane
are Miketsu and Hotarugusa.)

646
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,590
(Let's play it with a steady pace.)

647
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,200
The team is ready to start the game.

648
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,000
K, help the Cat in the early stage.

649
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,550
Okay.

650
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,830
Cheng, I'm with shift.

651
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,110
I'm always at your disposal.

652
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,790
Okay

653
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,310
Lu Yue, don't press the line.

654
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,110
Okay.

655
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,310
(Lv is playing very steadily.)

656
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,830
(That's right. Don't be
too aggressive in the early stages.)

657
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,960
(There's a situation in the middle lane.
There is a fight.)

658
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,350
(Ready to go back to his turret.)

659
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,550
(But obviously it's too late.)

660
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920
(Enenra goes forward with an instant step.)

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,680
(Directly unleashes the skill combination
to kill off Marisha Ray.)

662
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,640
First Blood is amazing!

663
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,070
(Lv actually got First Blood.)

664
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,270
Good for you, Lv.

665
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,110
Not bad.

666
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,920
This is a good move.

667
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,830
It's pretty cool.

668
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,680
Lv plays Enenra

669
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,310
just a little bit better than I do.

670
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
A little bit?

671
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,200
I think he's a lot better than you.

672
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,680
That's right.

673
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,000
If I was better than him,

674
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,310
I would be playing professional, right?

675
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,270
Nice.

676
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,110
Not bad.

677
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,680
Lu Yue, join the team fight.

678
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,590
Get the monster after the fight.

679
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,510
Chubby, stay close.

680
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,240
Coming.

681
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,960
Minion, take it.

682
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,510
(There is a small team fight
down the bottom lane.)

683
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,000
(Nice!)

684
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,540
(Defeat)

685
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,070
(ZGDX killed two people,)

686
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,510
(winning the team fight.)

687
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
I'm going to take my line.

688
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,270
Come back after it.

689
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,350
(ZGDX is now hitting the monster.)

690
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,590
Shooter, watch out, don't get caught.

691
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,160
Try to move backwards.

692
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,310
(We can go up. We can go up.)

693
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,640
(Killed off monster)
(But there are not enough people.)

694
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,830
I took the monster.

695
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,590
Lu Yue.

696
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,720
Right away.

697
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,400
Lu Yue.

698
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,680
(Why is Lv still hitting the line
and not going to the team fight?)

699
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,070
Wait, I'm coming!

700
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,960
Come on, what are you doing?

701
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,750
(Let's go to the team fight.)

702
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,750
(What's with the obsession
on hitting the line?)

703
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,920
Lu Yue, hurry up,
I'm running out of blood too fast.

704
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,350
I can't take it anymore, hurry up.

705
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,880
Control, control, control!

706
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,440
Controlled, controlled.

707
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,750
Up, up. Good.

708
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,750
(Defeat)

709
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Retreat.

710
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,350
Lu Yue, are your headphones working?

711
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,680
Can you listen to us?

712
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,270
(The gold advantage they just built up)

713
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,590
(is caught up)

714
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,830
(by Obsidian in this team fight.)

715
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,540
(Lv didn't coordinate well)

716
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,260
(- this time.)
- Cat, hold on. Wait for the next fight.

717
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,200
(Adjust and continue.)

718
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,880
(Cat, you're always with K.)

719
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,240
- Be ready anytime.
- Going the same route as before.

720
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,000
Good.

721
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,880
- Can't beat it, can't beat it.
- Help me, help me!

722
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,440
- Let's go, now.
- Hurry up.

723
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,340
(Defeat)

724
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,830
Last team fight, chase them.

725
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,880
Okay, here we go.

726
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,640
Go! Go!

727
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,480
Push it.

728
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,820
(Reinforcements join the battlefield)

729
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,750
Just push the line.

730
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
In one breath.

731
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,510
A chance of the last team fight.

732
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,030
Yes! Yes!

733
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,590
Lu Yue, we would've won earlier
if you played this way.

734
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,350
It's true.

735
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Seeing your substitute
getting the cheers on the stage

736
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,680
while you can just sit here

737
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,880
and watch in silence,

738
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
how does it feel?

739
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I once said in the post-game interview video,

740
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,510
I'm happy to have a teammate like Smiling.

741
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,070
Because she joined us,

742
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,030
ZGDX

743
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,000
will be stronger than ever this summer.

744
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,200
But now they're questioning my vision.

745
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,160
They are questioning
whether I made a mistake,

746
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,110
whether I was wrong about
the positioning of you and Lu Yue.

747
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,960
Why?

748
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,110
Keep your head up.

749
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
But I don't care if people question my vision

750
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,790
and my judgment.

751
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,350
The point is you.

752
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,240
It's you I care about.

753
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,460
(Timer)

754
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Seven minutes left.

755
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,960
Before the next game starts,

756
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,510
I want a reason so strong that

757
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
no matter what anyone says,
I won't give up on you.

758
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,550
With you looking at me like this,

759
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,790
I can't say anything.

760
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,790
If you go on any longer,

761
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,830
I can't even remember my ID number.

762
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,750
6 minutes and 40 seconds left.

763
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,160
Can I ask a question?

764
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,400
In what capacity and from what position

765
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,590
are you asking me this?

766
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,550
Your captain, your teammate.

767
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,270
Any passerby on the street will do.

768
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,480
Six minutes and thirty seconds left.

769
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,200
What I want is an answer

770
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,880
that will convince everyone,

771
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,830
not just some double talk

772
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,200
to fool me.

773
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,720
Please be as honest

774
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,790
as you were yesterday
when you were talking on live.

775
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,110
Six minutes and twenty seconds left.

776
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,550
Stop the count down.

777
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,880
Give me some time

778
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,640
or give me a hint.

779
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,000
This came too suddenly.

780
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,590
I'm not prepared at all.

781
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,960
I can't say anything.

782
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,920
Start with your behavior that day.

783
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,310
I hit someone.

784
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,640
AGI's topsolo

785
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,070
cursed people in the ranking game

786
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
before joining the professional team,

787
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,510
and abused his teammates

788
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,000
in the early days in the professional team,

789
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,720
he said their skills made him sick.

790
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,680
That's how he was criticized
as a keyboard warrior.

791
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,830
Since then, everyone said he was unqualified.

792
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,510
He has been ridiculed for two years.

793
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,110
Now he won't swear for a second

794
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,200
even he goes live streaming
for ten hours a day,

795
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,640
and he will never type away his anger.

796
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,680
What's the use?

797
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,160
Still can't clear his name.

798
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,830
CEL's captain

799
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,000
was blindly arrogant, abandoned his teammates

800
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,270
and disappeared from training.

801
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,310
He even went out to play games with girls

802
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,240
when preparing for
the national finals tournament.

803
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,590
In the end, he was defeated
in the national finals.

804
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,070
He crossed the turret,
didn't make his ultimate skill and was killed.

805
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,240
He has been ridiculed to this day.

806
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,240
People say he deserved it
for being proud and arrogant.

807
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,030
Even though everyone knows that a year later,

808
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,440
his temper has changed greatly.

809
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,270
He is more discreet and restrained,

810
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,880
serious and calm.

811
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,790
What's the point?

812
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,160
He can't get back on.

813
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,790
Do you remember what I reminded you of?

814
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,350
Watch what I say and do.

815
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,590
Anything that happens
to a professional player

816
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,070
can be put in spotlight easily

817
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,270
or even kill one's career.

818
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
So don't make any trouble yourself.

819
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,790
Where did you put it?

820
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,960
The back of my head.

821
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,550
In yesterday's training match,

822
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,030
Lu Yue was killed in
3 minutes and 50 seconds.

823
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,070
After that,

824
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,960
his gold and other aspects
couldn't get up again.

825
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,000
Along it, at 5 minutes and 37 seconds,

826
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,960
7 minutes and 49 seconds,

827
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,270
12 minutes and 11 seconds,

828
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,000
K tried to raid the middle lane three times,

829
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,070
but they all ended in failure

830
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
because Lu Yue was used to
being a coward under his own turret.

831
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,550
It ended in failure.

832
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,510
In today's game,

833
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,400
just now,

834
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,070
at 12 minutes and 20 seconds,

835
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,200
when K robbed the monster,

836
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,160
we had four people
while the opponent had five.

837
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,640
But the opposing shooter

838
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,960
was inferior in both equipment and gold

839
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,110
since I contained him in the early stage.

840
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,720
Coming.

841
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,350
So it was possible for us to win.

842
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,510
Even if we were pinned by Obsidian,

843
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,270
we had a good chance to win.

844
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,350
At the key moment,

845
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,550
Lu Yue couldn't keep up the pace.

846
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,270
He went to the middle to collect the line.

847
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,550
As a result, we were one man short.

848
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,510
- Three against five.
- Can you listen to us?

849
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,160
Lu Yue, are your headphones even working?

850
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,680
Withdraw.

851
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,030
This was against Obsidian.

852
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,550
If it was against CK or YQCB,

853
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,550
we would have lost.

854
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,640
Feelings.

855
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,920
Bad coordination.

856
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,510
Why is that?

857
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
Because when you are in the training match,

858
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,750
you're used to pressing
the opponent into the turret.

859
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,640
K practiced a habitual

860
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,510
anti-ambush jungle trick because you.

861
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
Tong Yao, back up a little.

862
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,750
Kosodenote will come to gank you.

863
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,030
K, rush to support.

864
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,920
Coming.

865
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,980
(Killingspree)

866
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,510
She is an aggressive player.

867
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,350
Impulsive.

868
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,400
But her judgment rate is still quite high.

869
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,350
When she crosses the river,

870
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,160
I will help her ambush.

871
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,270
Because K changed to fit your style,

872
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
he was not able to adapt immediately
when Lu Yue came on the field.

873
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,350
If it were you in that fight just now,

874
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,350
you would have gone straight up.

875
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,310
So they did the same

876
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,920
without hesitation.

877
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,640
Why?

878
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,830
Habitual coordination.

879
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,310
Where did it come from?

880
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,300
(Defeat)

881
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,310
Come on, Tong Yao is on.

882
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,510
Come on, come on. Follow up.

883
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,340
(Double Kill)

884
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,070
Nice.

885
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,200
Nice.

886
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,000
From the usual training matches
and ranking double-queues,

887
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,320
the team and teammates
have changed to accommodate you.

888
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,070
So how can you be so irresponsible?

889
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,320
Do you still think

890
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,110
you're the only one affected by the ban?

891
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,480
You did something wrong

892
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,550
and accepted the punishment.

893
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,280
And that's the end of the story?

894
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,630
You sat below the stage
and watched your teammates play.

895
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,920
Have you ever thought about the fact that

896
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,000
your teammates are
also getting punished with you?

897
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,880
They have to forget about

898
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,880
all the training with you

899
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,190
and start adapting again.

900
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,960
If you're not repented
the first time you get banned

901
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,190
and you make the same mistake

902
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,280
and get yourself banned again,

903
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,110
will the team still hire you?

904
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,150
Should you still be allowed to
participate in future training matches?

905
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,150
Should you still be invited to ranking?

906
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,000
Should the team change their style again

907
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,320
because of you?

908
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,710
There are many people
who are good at this game.

909
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,320
There are countless people
waiting to replace you.

910
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,230
Should we continue to use you

911
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,710
or should we use Lu Yue?

912
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,110
Or do we recruit a new midsolo?

913
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,400
Lu Yue was banned for being impulsive.

914
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,510
He hurt Ming.

915
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,920
He was the reason that we can't
participate in the national finals.

916
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,070
He came back in disgrace this time.

917
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,760
His teammates chose to forgive him.

918
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
You can ask him

919
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,670
if he has forgiven himself by now.

920
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,510
Thoughts.

921
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,110
Onmyoji Arena is a team game.

922
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,190
There is no individual heroism

923
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,000
in e-sports.

924
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,000
Three minutes left.

925
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,110
As I said,

926
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,630
I don't care what everyone else thinks.

927
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,150
All I care about is how you see yourself.

928
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,960
Continue or quit.

929
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,070
Professional gaming

930
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,710
isn't where you can do as you please.

931
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,400
Professional careers are short.

932
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,280
The golden pinnacle is fleeting.

933
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,840
You can't afford to waste yourself,

934
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,280
and certainly can't afford to delay others.

935
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,480
And I am the captain of the team.

936
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,880
Miss.

937
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,960
I don't care what you think.

938
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,030
But I'm sure

939
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,360
that as a top professional team,

940
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,110
ZGDX wants you here to play the games.

941
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,440
There may be people in this industry

942
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,190
who treat you differently
because you're a girl,

943
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,360
they might look down on you,

944
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,070
discriminate against you, admire you,

945
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,840
love you or take pity on you.

946
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,150
But I won't.

947
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,550
In my opinion,

948
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,110
you have an identity that

949
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,960
has nothing to do with gender
as soon as you put on the team uniform.

950
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,800
That's my teammate.

951
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,440
Cheng.

952
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,840
Cheng, open the door.

953
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,710
Time's up.

954
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,710
It seems like you still
don't have anything to say to me.

955
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,150
I don't know how to say nice things.

956
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,920
And I don't know how to apologize
without a proper reason.

957
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
All I know is

958
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,550
I want to win every game with you guys,

959
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,960
and not to miss a single one of them.

960
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't want to let you guys down again.

961
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,400
I don't want to be
a stumbling block for anyone.

962
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,670
I want to be your teammate,

963
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,110
and wait for the day when

964
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,150
I can stand on the top of the world

965
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
where you and I are both striving to reach.

966
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,920
I know you've been wronged.

967
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,920
You may think that
you were defending your teammates.

968
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,800
Why do you have to be treated like this?

969
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,510
We all thank you for your defense.

970
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,480
So we finally played that game

971
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,880
in order to help you
change some people's opinions,

972
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,590
and tried to collect more evidence.

973
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,760
I do as well.

974
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,760
I also thank you for defending me.

975
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,110
But I'm not asking you
to get rid of your edges.

976
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,110
Miss.

977
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,070
I just want you to know,

978
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,320
before you protect others,

979
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,000
you must first learn to protect yourself.

980
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,280
When will I be able to protect myself?

981
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,800
When you are so strong

982
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,280
that no one can defeat you.

983
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,960
Captain.

984
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,190
Cheng.

985
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,590
What are you doing?

986
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,550
It's almost time to play.

987
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,590
I'm going to the game.

988
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,280
Cheng.

989
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,710
Are you one of those people?

990
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,920
What?

991
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,190
Strong enough to be fearless.

992
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm not.

993
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,320
I have my fears,

994
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,920
hesitations,

995
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,070
and times when I don't know what to do.

996
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,440
Cheng.

997
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,070
One last question.

998
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,190
Go ahead.

999
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,760
You've been ignoring me
for the past few days.

1000
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,800
Is it just because you're angry,

1001
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,400
or because of something else?

1002
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Because I was afraid.

1003
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,670
My captain, it's about to start.

1004
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,840
I was afraid I'd go soft-hearted.
