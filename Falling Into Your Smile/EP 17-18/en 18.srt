1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,310
(There's never been fake news
from the E-sports Industry Farm.)

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,750
(I'm your only diva of true news.)

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,870
(There's a lot of news
in the e-sports industry lately.)

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,350
(There is finally)

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,590
(a rumor out that
the idol of the industry, Chessman,)

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,080
(- Rumor has it that he has a girlfriend now.)
- Thank you.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,880
Smiling.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,280
(FNC's jungler Kun)

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,870
(unexpectedly appeared in the audience.)

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,960
(I'm thinking of the last time
when he kept ganking Smiling,)

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,550
(we have every reason to suspect)

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,120
(that there are some
hidden secrets between them.)

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,870
You're cute, Smiling.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,350
(Of course,)

15
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,550
(the biggest blockbuster)

16
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,190
(is Cheng's amazing hug
at the scene of the match,)

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,430
(as well as the solo game of
the two center players of ZGDX.)

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,070
Come on, Shorty, let's solo.

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,220
(Excuse me.)

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,840
(Who will be the ultimate girlfriend
revealed in public?)

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,100
=Falling into Your Smile=

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,860
=Episode 17=

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,710
I just took a nap by accident.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,480
How did I miss

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,840
such a big solo game?

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
Oh my God, Jinyang, I'm going deaf.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
What happened then?

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,350
You won the solo against Cheng and then what?

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
Don't tell me you will chicken out.

31
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,430
I knew Lu Sicheng must like you.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
He must have lost to you on purpose.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,910
You think so too?

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,430
In the eyes of romance novels and fans,

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,910
that's true.

36
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,750
He seems to have lost to me on purpose.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,280
But here's the thing.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,910
When I was playing against him,

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,840
I could feel

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,560
he wasn't going easy on me at all.

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,750
He really wanted to beat me.

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
Maybe I did win

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,800
because I'm more familiar with

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,590
the middle lane routes and terrain than him.

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,120
Pretend.

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,910
You go on pretending, I'm hanging up.

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,630
No, it's true.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,430
And...

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,800
Forget it.

50
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know what's going on either.

51
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,750
I told you

52
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,840
not to put up "flags" so nonchalantly.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
Like you won't fall in love
with a professional player.

54
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,240
You'll be biting your own tongue constantly
after saying that kind of thing.

55
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,560
What about Cheng?

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
What did he say?

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
You guys didn't ask him a single question
after the solo?

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,470
What should I ask?

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,870
We're all teammates.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,750
What if

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,150
I made an inappropriate action

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,190
and got rejected,

63
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,840
how could we play again in the future?

64
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,870
How embarrassing.

65
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,030
You were really thinking too much.

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
I didn't even think that much
with Ai Jia at the time.

67
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,190
We are teammates.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,520
Compared to things with uncertain results,

69
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,560
I'd prefer to play well in the tournament.

70
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,560
And I don't want someone else to say,

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,030
you girls came to play professionally

72
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,470
just to be famous or to find a man.

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,150
Okay.

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
I didn't expect that

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,590
our silly girl

77
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,840
would actually grow up some day.

78
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,840
Or else?

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,710
But

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,910
I have to advise you as someone experienced.

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,910
In this kind of situation,

82
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,560
women should not act rashly.

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,520
Men won't be able to hold back
if they really do like you.

84
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,750
Really?

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,750
But

86
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,870
if he really takes his time in making a move,

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,710
then

88
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,000
it probably really is just your fantasy.

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,310
Okay.

90
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,190
Bye-bye.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,510
Cheng, you haven't left yet?

92
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,480
Didn't you say

93
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,630
your blind date

94
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,310
asked you to meet her one last time?

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's already late.

96
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,430
Why haven't you gotten ready to go?

97
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,310
What's wrong?

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
You're not going?

99
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,920
Didn't someone say she didn't want me to go?

100
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,630
Who is she to meddle?

101
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,000
You... You heard all that?

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,070
I'm not deaf.

103
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,560
Then why did you pretend…

104
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,480
I care about dignity.

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,680
I... I was just saying it off handedly.

106
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,270
I was afraid that you would be distracted.

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Think about it.

108
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,310
Our teammates, they all hope to

109
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,360
win the championship trophy this year,

110
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,560
as well as the championship skin,

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,190
"revenge of Hierophant" or something.

112
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,310
Biscuit.

113
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,720
There you are.

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,360
Let's go.

115
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,800
Let's go eat some canned food.

116
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,190
What's up?

117
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
What are you two talking about?

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
What Hierophant revenge?

119
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,510
No, nothing.

120
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
I'm going back inside.

121
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,630
You're not going out?

122
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm not going out.

123
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,950
You stood her up again?

124
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,720
I said we'd make it
at the entrance of the base

125
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,600
so that I don't have to drive out.

126
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,920
There is no dating in e-sports.

127
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,270
Our goal this year
is to win the national championship.

128
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,920
Good that you know.

129
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,830
Let's go, Biscuit.

130
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go eat canned food.

131
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,310
Cheng.

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
You lost the solo on purpose, didn't you?

133
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,600
Why would I lose it on purpose?

134
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,240
Yang told me.

135
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,870
Then why did you lose?

136
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,830
Do you want me to explain

137
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,950
the reason for my defeat to you?

138
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you want me to write
an 800-word review for you?

139
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,800
The whole world can see that

140
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
you lost on purpose.

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,390
No.

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040
I miscalculated the distance of the lines.

143
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,190
She caught the opportunity.

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,950
You wouldn't make that kind of mistake.

145
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,600
At least I haven't seen it before.

146
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
I'm not an immortal
who doesn't make mistakes.

147
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,950
Besides,

148
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,240
why would I lose to her on purpose?

149
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,630
I don't know about you.

150
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,950
Anyway,

151
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
I did see the tenderness.

152
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,390
You're blind.

153
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,680
Our team's midsolo

154
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,040
can't recognize that kind of tricky set up.

155
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,950
Besides,

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,870
now that she's beaten me,

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,360
she's thinking about how to take my place

158
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,190
and take over the team.

159
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,950
To be gentle with her

160
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
- is to be cruel to me.
- What? What's he saying?

161
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,390
He's saying yes and meaning no.

162
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
I don't understand you men.

163
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,750
Why do you all like to play

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,190
this kind of double-faced trick?

165
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,510
What's the difference

166
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
between your behavior

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,510
and the boy in kindergarten who likes to pull

168
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,750
the pigtail of the little girl
he has a crush on?

169
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,750
I'm going.

170
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,160
Let's go.

171
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,310
What?

172
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,190
Someone's coming to see you later, too?

173
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,480
No.

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm here to check the weather.

175
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,270
Aren't we going out
for a late night snack later?

176
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,310
No, we'll just have it brought in.

177
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,480
Miss Su.

178
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,750
I already told you last time.

179
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,720
We're not a match.

180
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,600
Lu Sicheng.

181
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,320
Are you not happy

182
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,910
that I went to see you
at the site of the match,

183
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,910
you think that I'm too high-profile?

184
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,840
I really didn't mean it.

185
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,510
I answered what they asked me.

186
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,200
I didn't expect you to be so famous.

187
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,150
And I didn't expect

188
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,600
they would analyze what I said so deeply.

189
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,320
Now those fans of yours

190
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,000
are already in an uproar.

191
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,240
I'm really sorry.

192
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,910
They even found my Weibo account.

193
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Some people are really nasty,

194
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,480
saying things like

195
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,910
I'm shameless.

196
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,550
I pretend to be your girlfriend.

197
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,480
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,510
Why are you apologizing?

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,870
It's not your fault.

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,150
It's your fans.

201
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,150
Although I don't know much about

202
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,720
the e-sports industry,

203
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
if it means that we can be together,

204
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,240
I am willing to
learn about and understand it.

205
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,360
It has nothing to do with this.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,390
I don't know if Lu Yue told you

207
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,360
something that made you misunderstand.

208
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,480
Some nonsense such as

209
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,670
the rules of this industry.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,870
You can ignore it.

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,360
The truth is that if I want someone,

212
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,720
I will protect her.

213
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,910
So it has nothing to do with this.

214
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,000
Then you're afraid that
your fans will be upset?

215
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,790
I'm not an idol
in the entertainment industry.

216
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm an e-sports player, not a monk.

217
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,000
Then what is it?

218
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,960
We're not a good match.

219
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,150
In what way?

220
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,150
Family background,

221
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,750
appearance, IQ or height?

222
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,870
Give me a hug.

223
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,150
Even they can be together.

224
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,910
Isn't it good?

225
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,960
Bye-bye.

226
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,240
That little girl

227
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,320
is young enough to be his daughter.

228
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,150
What kind of person do you like?

229
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,960
Someone who can play games better than me.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,080
Isn't that all just a hype gimmick?

231
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,000
No, it's not.

232
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,440
But is there really such a person?

233
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,960
I heard you're a good gamer.

234
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,480
No one is better than you.

235
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,080
It's not necessarily

236
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,960
in terms of the Onmyoji Arena.

237
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,120
If she can play Tetris better than me,
that will work.

238
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,550
It's just that if it is in Onmyoji Arena,

239
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,630
then I'll go straight to marrying her.

240
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,390
Bye.

241
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,270
Why is Cheng not back yet?

242
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,840
The shop is very popular.
The crayfish will be all gone if we're late.

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,030
Yeah, what's going on?

244
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,750
It's been 20 minutes.

245
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,670
That's right, I'm starving to death.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,320
Screw this, I'm going to go check it out.

247
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
For what?

248
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Your performance this month is in danger.

249
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Ranking, ranking, ranking.

250
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,870
What?

251
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,840
- I can't do it.
- Don't.

252
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,320
It's your fault
for telling me to go to the gym.

253
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,790
We'll rank while we wait.

254
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,150
Why don't I go check it out?

255
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
Okay, go.

256
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,870
What are you looking at? Get logged in.

257
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,120
You two get on with the ranking, I'll watch.

258
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,270
- No way.
- I can't do it.

259
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,080
What? You're scared of ghosts again?

260
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,960
Chubby said he's hungry.

261
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,320
He asked me to rush you to buy crayfish.

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
Well...

263
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Where's your blind date?

264
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,320
She's gone?

265
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,440
She's gone.

266
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,360
Let's go. Let's drive to get some crayfish.

267
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,790
We have to drive there?

268
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
The shop is in the south of the city.

269
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,750
If you had told us earlier,
I wouldn't have run out.

270
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,080
I didn't ask you to chase me out.

271
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,630
You...

272
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,080
Sir.

273
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,630
You want so many crayfish at once.

274
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,510
Are you entertaining friends at home
with your girlfriend?

275
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,630
She is not my girlfriend.

276
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,510
She's my teammate.

277
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,720
Teammate?

278
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,120
I see the way she looks at you.

279
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
That's either the way a girl
would look at a boyfriend

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,600
or the way she would look at a husband.

281
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,670
The girl likes you, am I right?

282
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,750
If you don't like her, just say so.

283
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,510
Don't break her heart.

284
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,030
Let's go.

285
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,030
What did you say to the waitress?

286
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,080
You were smiling so sweetly.

287
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,510
What's wrong with your eyes?

288
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,670
She gave you a discount?

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,630
No, she didn't.

290
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,240
Then why were you smiling so happily?

291
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,960
She said you look at me

292
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,080
as though you were looking at your boyfriend.

293
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,480
No way.

294
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,150
How can a waitress be that bored?

295
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,360
Take a break.

296
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,670
What's wrong with you?

297
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,000
Your hand hurts?

298
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,440
Is your hand injured?

299
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,840
I've been playing professionally
for a long time.

300
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,080
And I'm a shooter.

301
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,320
It's normal to have a little hand injury.

302
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,120
It's just a strain injury.

303
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,240
As long as I don't usually lift heavy things,

304
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,000
I…

305
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,320
What are you doing?

306
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,870
Why did you not say earlier that
you have a hand injury?

307
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
Why is that such a big deal?

308
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,390
I have a strain injury, not a disability.

309
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:35,960
Give it to me.

310
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,910
No.

311
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
I once carried gas tanks
for my mother at home.

312
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,750
I'm not that delicate.

313
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,870
You just wait for me here.

314
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,790
Hey.

315
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,840
Lu Sicheng, open the door.

316
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,630
What a novelty.

317
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,030
What?

318
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,870
It's the first time for me
to be taken care of by a little girl.

319
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,720
But I'm not a little girl.

320
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,120
In a word,

321
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,910
thank you.

322
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,670
Let's go.

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,720
Seatbelt.

324
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,550
Cheng.

325
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,000
Did you lose that solo game on purpose?

326
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,000
What do you think?

327
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,030
I don't think so.

328
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,070
It's not like you're a little girl
who needs to be coaxed like that.

329
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,480
You make it seem as if

330
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,200
you know the trick well.

331
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,680
You wouldn't get it anyway.

332
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,880
I can see it.

333
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm a girl.

334
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,830
You're not.

335
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,160
You are.

336
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,480
Cheng.

337
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,830
What is it?

338
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,920
I…

339
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
I…

340
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,200
You have to arrange
your training time wisely,

341
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
so as not to aggravate your hand injury.

342
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,830
We have a physiotherapist
coming to our base every month.

343
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,110
Cheng.

344
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,960
I think...

345
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,880
Do you want to listen to a song?

346
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,440

At least 5 kg are mine alone.

357
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,240
And this row of

RIO

359
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,550
is our midsolo's favorite.

360
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,070
She once said

361
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
RIO Light and shrimp go perfectly together.

362
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,920
That's right.

364
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,680
(so that I can look at others.)

365
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,830
(I don't want to look at you, you fatty.)

366
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,240
What fatty? Speak nicely.

367
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,960
This is how you expect me
to turn the camera for you?

368
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,110
You are a fatty.

369
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,310
Let me show you.

370
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,240
This

371
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,440
crayfish is at the price of 156 yuan a pound.

372
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
Before it's cooked,
they even spit out colorful bubbles.

373
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,270
(Food poisoning, right?)

374
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,200
(It looks like hormones.)

375
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,310
You…

376
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,240
Okay, okay.

377
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,270
I won't talk to you.

378
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,270
Live streaming slows down
my vigor of eating crayfish.

379
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,960
Don't forget

380
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,640
to give me gifts.

381
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,400
Why don't you eat?

382
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
He thinks it's too much trouble

383
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,960
and leaves a taste on the fingers.

384
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,790
The smell won't dissipate for two whole days.

385
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,830
It's too unpleasant.

386
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,790
Look at his psychological burden.

387
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,480
Unless you peel the crayfish

388
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,830
and put it in a bowl for him.

389
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,310
You thought you were eating Boston lobster,

390
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,590
expecting someone else to serve you?

391
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,880
You watched me peel it.

392
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,240
I didn't put rat poison in it.

393
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,750
Forget it if you don't eat.

394
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,960
Have another sip of RIO.

395
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,880
Hurry up.

396
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,790
Hurry up.

397
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,590
What do you think? I told you so.

398
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,820
Why is Cheng so obedient?

399
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,110
Want some more?

400
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,750
You like to peel crayfish for people?

401
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,680
I was about to say,

402
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,030
"I'm not going to serve you
even if you want more".

403
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,920
You paid for it.

404
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
So at least I should let you taste it.

405
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,310
That's being polite.

406
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,200
Rude.

407
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,790
You two solo during the day

408
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,790
while feeding each other shrimp
and flirting at night.

409
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,400
You two have gone conjugal!

410
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
(Chubby, I dare you
to turn the camera around!)

411
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,110
(Let us see what's happening over there.)

412
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,620
Turn what?
No, I can't turn it with a handful of oil.

413
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,720
(- Who's feeding the shrimp to whom?)
- You can slap me.

414
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,070
(Who's conjugal with whom?)

415
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,800
You guys, just look at me.

416
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,680
Who wants to see
you eating shrimp on live streaming?

417
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,070
- Who wants to see you, chubby?
- Go away.

418
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,580
No way.

419
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,680
Shut up.

420
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,350
I just got a call from the club.

421
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,640
They want us to participate in an event.

422
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,920
There's a competition this weekend.
What's the event?

423
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,240
Cheng.

424
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,310
You've repeatedly rejected Su Luo lately.

425
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
Mrs. Lu is so angry that

426
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,590
she's taking it out on the club.

427
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,640
I've put off all the other events I could.

428
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,790
But I've already signed the contract

429
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,680
for this Saturday's out-of-town event
for the Next Gen Anime Expo.

430
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,400
So…

431
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,270
We have a full schedule
of competitions afterwards.

432
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
How can we be going out of town on Saturday?

433
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,270
We go and come back on the same day?

434
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,880
What the club means is that

435
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
we'll go directly
to the airport after the match,

436
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,440
and then we can fly back

437
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,240
after the event on Saturday.

438
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Can we not go?

439
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Then you'll have to find Mrs. Lu.

440
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,200
Tell the club

441
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,310
that this is the last time.

442
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,060
(Onmyoji Arena)

443
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,980
(Luyun Mountain Stream)

444
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,620
(With a song of confession,
the clouds fade away)

445
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,580
(Ping'an)

446
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,310
We left two hours early.

447
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,350
I didn't even eat breakfast. I'm starving.

448
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm really sorry.

449
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
It was because I was afraid of traffic jams.

450
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,640
So the trip was arranged in advance.

451
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,550
Breakfast benefits.

452
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,350
Rui.

453
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,550
You've finally become humane.

454
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,240
You knew I haven't eaten breakfast.

455
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,750
- I'm so hungry, brother.
- What are you talking about?

456
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm telling you a truth that

457
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the early bird gets the worm

458
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,110
through my actions.

459
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,550
If I have a good panini like this every day,

460
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,680
I guarantee that I can quit staying in bed.

461
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
If one breakfast
can keep you guys from staying in bed,

462
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,000
I would really will

463
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,270
be willing to be your breakfast housekeeper.

464
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,440
Come, come, look over here.

465
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,310
One, two, three.

466
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,240
What are you doing?

467
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,310
Taking a picture
to send to the official blogger

468
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,310
so that she can hook up

469
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,480
KFC's breakfast sponsorship.

470
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,000
Rui is the best at stingy skills.

471
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,440
- What are you talking about?
- Rui.

472
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,590
What exactly is the event today?

473
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,030
I don't know. The club arranged it.

474
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,880
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

475
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,720
Sorry, sorry.

476
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,750
- Cheng.
- We're putting on makeup, sorry.

477
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,880
- Cheng.
- Sign for me.

478
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,940
- Sorry, you can't go in.
- Sign for me.

479
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,830
Please sign for us, Cheng.

480
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,310
No, they're having their makeup done.

481
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,070
- Cheng.
- Sign for us.

482
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,000
One autograph, just one autograph.

483
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,750
Keep your voices down.

484
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,790
Okay, okay, okay.

485
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,830
Hurry up, everyone!

486
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,550
Cheng!

487
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,350
- Cheng.
- Cheng.

488
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,720
Cheng got up so early today.

489
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,240
I didn't think he'd be so patient.

490
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,240
Cheng is a veteran.

491
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,310
Does he want to be trolled
by his ignorant fans saying that

492
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,310
he's too indifferent?

493
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,480
- Cheng, mine.
- Thank you.

494
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,480
I want a signature too.

495
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,030
Sign here.

496
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,960
And mine.

497
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,790
This is mine.

498
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,070
Tong Yao, please help me sign one.

499
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,720
Thank you.

500
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,550
(Lu Sicheng)
Thank you. Thank you.

501
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Thank you, Cheng.

502
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
- Thank you.
- Mine.

503
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,790
Thank you.

504
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,350
Thank you.

505
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,440
Thank you!

506
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
Cheng, it's done.

507
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,350
There's not much time left,
so try to hurry up.

508
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,880
Thank you.

509
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,590
Thank you.

510
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,070
Please sign it.

511
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,640
- Cheng.
- Cheng, sign for me.

512
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Smiling, please help me to sign it.

513
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,200
Here.

514
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

515
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,640
Please sign it here.

516
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,510
Thank you.

517
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,550
And this one too.

518
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,160
So handsome!

519
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,550
You are even more handsome
in person than in photos.

520
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,240
(Lu Sicheng)

521
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,200
Thank you.

522
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,160
Sign this for me, Smiling.

523
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,400
And this one.

524
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,240
Thank you.

525
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,590
Thank you, Cheng.

526
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,790
- Thank you, Cheng.
- Thank you, Smiling.

527
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,310
- Give me an autograph too.
- I want one too.

528
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,590
Can you sign for me too?

529
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,110
Smiling, please give me an autograph.

530
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Smiling.

531
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,310
You've been here three times already.

532
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,480
That was for myself just now.

533
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,310
- This is for my friend.
- Thank you.

534
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
It won't take you long anyway.

535
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,030
Just sign it.

536
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,350
Cheng.

537
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,920
Sign for me, Cheng.

538
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,720
Rui.

539
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,920
What's wrong?

540
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,640
She's been here three times already.

541
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,960
Is she done?

542
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,830
Okay, I'll take care of it.

543
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
Sorry.

544
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,830
We don't have time for the makeup.

545
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,880
Why don't you stop signing for now?

546
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,070
It's just an autograph.

547
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,350
So what?

548
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,030
Why are you so pretentious?

549
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,160
Good job.

550
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,550
These people just want to
show off to their friends, like

551
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,960
"I can go backstage to see someone,

552
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,480
do you want his autograph?"

553
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,350
And then they run over
to ask for an autograph.

554
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,640
In fact, maybe

555
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,590
they don't even know what you do.

556
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,550
They just know
you're celebrities who play games.

557
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,830
Your hair is done. I'll leave now.

558
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,270
Do you want to eat?

559
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,030
I'm on a diet.

560
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,920
I'll eat then.

561
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,740
(The girl from the e-sports team is pretty arrogant.
Acting like she is a big figure.)

562
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,720
(This girl is a professional?
She must be a staff member, right?)

563
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,400
(I think I know who you are talking about.)

564
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
(Making a fuss.)

565
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,920
(To be honest,
I've always had an issue with her.)

566
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,720
(I've always had a bias towards her.)

567
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,550
Everyone, take a look.

568
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,960
This is the flow of our event,

569
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,720
including some

570
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,030
interactive parts
in need of your cooperation.

571
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,590
Thank you.

572
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,110
Please prepare for the game too.

573
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,400
(Event execution flow chart)
Let the team members hug the show girls

574
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,920
and run from left stage to right stage.

575
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,590
The first show girl
to hit the gong with a hammer

576
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,830
will be the winner.

577
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,160
I see it.

578
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,720
It's completely pointless,
making a spectacle of ourselves.

579
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,030
Rui.

580
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,350
Have you seen this flow sheet?

581
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,030
Why is there such a game?

582
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,790
Don't worry, let me see.

583
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:47,920
This…

584
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,510
Don't look at it.

585
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
We're dressed like this.

586
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,550
It's not suitable for being picked up, right?

587
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes, that's right.

588
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,270
This skirt is too short.

589
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,110
We all live by our hands.

590
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,790
And we all have hand injuries.

591
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
This is not good, right?

592
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,440
This game

593
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,160
is not good for us.

594
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,000
It'll cause bad influence.

595
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,160
Why don't we change it?

596
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
We have all the game props ready,

597
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,070
and the timing is just right.

598
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,000
Now you suddenly say you want to change it.

599
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,000
That's not appropriate, don't you think?

600
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,880
No, look...

601
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,200
It's barely any time at all.
Just put up with it.

602
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,680
We have a game tomorrow.

603
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,550
What if someone gets hurt?

604
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,400
Who's going to play for us? You?

605
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,160
Miss,

606
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,750
you've been staring at me like that
since the beginning,

607
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
you've been looking for a fight, haven't you?

608
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,000
Didn't I just tell you that

609
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,960
the props are ready, the timing is set.

610
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,000
I can't change it.

611
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,550
No.

612
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,440
Listen to me.

613
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,480
It is true that our members
have injuries on their hands.

614
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,400
If…

615
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,270
We are all paid to work.

616
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,880
Don't make it seem like
you are more noble than us.

617
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,000
If you are really so unwilling,

618
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,000
then don't come.

619
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,920
Don't take money from the organizer

620
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,400
and at the same time pick a fight here.

621
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,160
Are you game players

622
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,960
all so high maintenance?

623
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,000
My boyfriend is also an e-sports player.

624
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,750
I don't see him being

625
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
so fragile like you guys.

626
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,070
You're all men.

627
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,510
It's like you're dying
just by carrying a girl

628
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,750
weighing several dozen pounds
and walking across a stage.

629
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,160
Do you want me to post a microblog saying

630
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,680
your team members are the most precious?

631
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,000
What are you doing?

632
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,680
What are you talking about?
Who are you threatening?

633
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,070
Okay, okay, okay.

634
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,960
Who threatened you?

635
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,550
Don't get upset.

636
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,200
We don't have to…

637
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,920
Don't touch me.

638
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,030
- Cat.
- Are you okay?

639
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,790
Why did you hit him?

640
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,510
Miss.

641
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,070
How could you hit me?

642
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,310
Are you going to blackmail me?

643
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,720
How could you hit me?

644
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,920
Lu Sicheng, let go!

645
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,480
Calm down, Miss.

646
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,200
Let go!

647
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,200
How can there be
a professional player like you?

648
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,720
What are you doing?

649
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,750
You want to hit a woman?

650
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,310
Did I hit you?

651
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,160
Like you're the only woman?

652
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,640
With which eye do you see that I'm a man?

653
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,750
Who are you?

654
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,110
Tong Yao.

655
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,200
This room is full of people.

656
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
Let go of me.

657
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680
Don't stop me.

658
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,240
Are you done?

659
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,830
It's okay. It's okay.

660
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,920
We'll head out first. We'll head out first.

661
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,550
It's okay. It's okay.

662
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,550
- Don't be upset.
- It's not worth it to be upset with her.

663
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,240
Except for Tong Yao,

664
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,350
everyone else
should go to the event immediately.

665
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,030
Take it easy.

666
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,480
Now,

667
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,790
your favorite ZGDX

668
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,960
is starting the competition.

669
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
Are you two ready?

670
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,790
Yes, we're ready.

671
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:56,960
Okay.

672
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Ready?

673
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,750
Go!

674
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,270
Go, handsome!

675
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Come on!

676
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,070
Go, go, go!

677
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,640
Good! Cat wins!

678
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,790
Let's have Chessman, Cheng, and K on stage.

679
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:50,550
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

680
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,660
(E-sports Industry Farm:
E-sports player Smiling acted like a diva)

681
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
(E-sports Industry Farm: Refused to cooperate
with the event and injured someone)

682
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,400
(Kitten ow)
It's okay.

683
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,550
My friends have come to pick me up.

684
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,960
There are many people at the scene.

685
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,350
My wounds have been taken care of.

686
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,350
Thank you all for your concern.

687
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,640
(A normal girl)

688
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,590
(can't possibly play professionally.)

689
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,200
(Either she is a transgender person…)

690
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,720
(Make it clear.)

691
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,830
(Or she is a psychopath.)

692
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,790
(Why did he hit you?)

693
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,310
(What did you say?)

694
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,160
I...

695
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,790
I just wanted to emphasize that

696
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,070
the organizers paid

697
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,110
them to perform.

698
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,310
(The ZGDX midsolo)

699
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,480
(picked a fight at the drop of a hat?)

700
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,160
(Is she crazy?)

701
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,030
(Outrageous.)

702
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,720
(Female fights are particularly exciting.)

703
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,440
(No matter what the reason is,
she always crosses the line.)

704
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,270
(Thank God you're okay.)

705
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,440
(Jiaqi is so gentle.)

706
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,550
(I could tell Tong Yao was of bad quality)

707
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,960
(just from her looks.)

708
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,440
With your concern and support,

709
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,550
I'll be fine soon.

710
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,000
Thank you all.

711
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,240
(My God.)

712
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,540
(E-sports player Smiling acted like a diva)
(This is currently the most popular)

713
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,000
(Refused to cooperate with the event and injured someone)
(e-sports Mulan,)

714
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,000
(E-sports player Smiling pushed someone)
(with a very bad temper.)

715
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,590
(Ning Jiaqi was injured)
(She just hit someone at the drop of a hat.)

716
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,790
(Spoiled by you brainless netizens)
(It's hard to hear some bad comments about her.)

717
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,400
(Is hitting people something to be proud of?)
(You told me it was a brawl.)

718
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
(- Before you start slandering her…)
- Hey, Mr. Zhang?

719
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,670
(- Let me laugh for a while first.)
- It's me again, me again.

720
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,920
Could you help me

721
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,230
block the keywords?

722
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,110
Yes, yes, about the fight.

723
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,000
- I'm really sorry.
- No problem, no problem.

724
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,110
I'll issue an official letter for you.

725
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,760
Thank you, thank you.

726
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,670
Mr. Zhang,
it's not like what the Internet says.

727
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,510
This is all our responsibility.

728
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,230
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,710
I'm really sorry.

730
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,030
We will definitely solve the problem
as soon as possible.

731
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,840
Please don't worry.

732
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,800
Mr. Li.

733
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,710
You're both here?

734
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,150
We are waiting for you.

735
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,070
Director Wang will be here soon.

736
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,590
You can talk to her yourselves.

737
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,070
Lu?

738
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,510
Director Wang herself came?

739
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,000
I thought…

740
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,920
Thought what?

741
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,150
Thought this was not severe enough?

742
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,960
No, no.

743
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,800
Director Wang.

744
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,840
Director Wang.

745
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,030
You're Tong Yao, right?

746
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,880
This is our first encounter.

747
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,280
I'll introduce myself.

748
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,190
My name is Wang Lan.

749
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,800
I am the executive director

750
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
assigned to ZGDX by the Lu's Group.

751
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,840
I have another identity they all know.

752
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,150
I am also the mother of
Lu Sicheng and Lu Yue.

753
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,880
Mrs. Lu?

754
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,550
Director Wang,
you go ahead, I'll go out first.

755
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,000
Director Wang, allow me to explain.

756
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,800
Really, you can't blame Tong Yao for this.

757
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,670
That woman was obviously there
to pick a fight.

758
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,070
And our competitions
have been very intense lately.

759
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,510
Cheng's hand injury also recurred.

760
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,150
If his hand injury worsens

761
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,880
due to running around

762
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,920
lifting those girls,

763
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,480
and thus affect his performance
in the game, it'll be bad.

764
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,030
Tong Yao was concerned about Cheng.

765
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,150
- So she's…
- Someone said…

766
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,480
ZGDX's midsolo acted like a diva.

767
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,110
No, that's not the case.

768
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,400
Some people also say

769
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,070
ZGDX's midsolo was very arrogant

770
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,280
just like a shrew.

771
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,150
Director Wang,

772
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,480
I am also responsible for this.

773
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,280
She and Tong Yao actually…

774
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,760
Of course, you are responsible.

775
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,360
Two months' salary and bonus
will be deducted.

776
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,760
Don't bargain with me.

777
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,070
It's really terrible to have such a mother.

778
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,000
As for Tong Yao,

779
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,400
how about this?

780
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,280
Why are you here?

781
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,510
Cheng, Director Wang is inside.

782
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,550
You can't go in right now.

783
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,630
(Cheng.)

784
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,630
- Cheng.
- You're finally here.

785
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,230
You're not at
the ribbon cutting ceremony with Dad?

786
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,150
What are you doing here?

787
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,760
Why are you so rude?

788
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,070
You can't even call me mom, can you?

789
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,190
It's such a big deal.

790
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,110
Of course, I had to come
and take care of it personally.

791
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,960
It's a simple matter.

792
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
I've already figured out how to handle it.

793
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,800
It's true that Tong Yao started it.

794
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,960
So no matter what,

795
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,480
the club has to take a stand first,

796
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,800
issue a statement of apology

797
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,150
and bump it to the top to show our sincerity.

798
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,920
But no one can be free to

799
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,630
speculate the truth of the matter.

800
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,630
So,

801
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,670
Rui,

802
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,280
go find some platforms and media

803
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,030
that are in good relationship with us

804
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,920
to clarify the situation.

805
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,960
Yes, yes, I think Cheng is right.

806
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,110
Besides the media,

807
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,590
I will find some other buddy teams,

808
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,630
such as CK and YQCB,

809
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,480
to help us clarify it

810
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,440
when they are live streaming.

811
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,230
And then?

812
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,070
And then…

813
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,920
Then what else?

814
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,070
You can't just only apologize
in an apology statement, no?

815
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,110
The club must give an explanation

816
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,230
for beating people.

817
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,230
Otherwise, it will seem insincere.

818
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,840
Then Director Wang,

819
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,710
you, how are you going to
make the punishment?

820
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,230
Ban Tong Yao from the competition.

821
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Ban me from the competition?

822
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,320
Well.

823
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,440
You don't want to take this

824
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,190
to Tournament Control, do you?

825
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,510
Ban her from one match.

826
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,280
That's fine.

827
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,280
But...

828
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,920
Rui, take Tong Yao out first.

829
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,360
I have to talk to my mother about something.

830
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Okay, Director Wang, we will go out first.

831
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,280
Go.

832
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,550
