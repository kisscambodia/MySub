1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,160
Cheng.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,440
So you are such a person?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,670
What?

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,590
Strong enough to be fearless.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm not.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,830
There is time when I fear,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,030
hesitate,

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,190
and don't know what to do.

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,480
(Cheng.)

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,440
(Are you really)

11
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,390
(strong enough to be fearless?)

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,070
(Yes, I am.)

13
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,550
(Because I have to protect you.)

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,550
Cheng.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,710
(Cheng, did I really make a mistake?)

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,520
(Should we call off our relationship?)

17
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,500
=Falling into Your Smile=

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,300
=Episode 27=

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,590
Why are you crying?

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,590
I'm not crying.

21
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,680
You're not crying?

22
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,280
Who was wailing like a wolf?

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Do you think this room is well sound-proof?

24
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,840
If you want to lie next time,

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
hide under the blanket and cry.

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,150
I'm sure I can't hear you
even you passed out for crying.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,190
I'm not crying.

28
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,080
I don't want to ask the same question again.

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,470
That's because

30
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,870
I was just washing my face

31
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,840
and my hand touched the water.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,630
It hurts, so that's why I cried.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
You wrap your fingers in an ugly way.

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
With only one hand,

35
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,560
can you wrap it beautifully?

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,470
Are you stupid?

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Why don't you let me help you?

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,470
I don't need your help.

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,680
I can do it myself.

40
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,870
It'll hurt a little.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,470
It hurts just as much as before.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Didn't you cry so loudly just now?

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,870
What?

44
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,000
You become tough

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,470
when I came?

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,870
I've cried enough.

47
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,840
What's wrong?

48
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,280
You wouldn't talk to me several days ago.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,590
And now you're coming all the way over here.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,030
What's this about?

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Are you looking for a joke?

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,150
Do you want to have a good laugh at me?

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
I came because I worried about you.

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
If you want me to leave,

55
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,000
either you don't cry

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,430
or you can deafen me.

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,080
(The man in front of me)

58
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,150
(the king of Onmyoji Arena Pro League,)

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,870
(is the god of the fans.)

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,630
(Was it really me)

61
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,000
(who dragged him down
from the altar little by little?)

62
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,030
(Am I really doing it for his sake?)

63
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,750
Bear with it.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,070
(- Cheng.)
- It will be fine soon.

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,430
(Did I really make a mistake?)

66
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,510
If I've done something wrong,

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,680
why don't you give me a scolding?

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Beating me up is fine.

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,750
Ban me from the game.

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,390
Just let me play training match.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,870
Make me absent from each game. It's all fine.

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,430
Why didn't you say anything

73
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,950
from beginning to end?

74
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,360
I could only watch you from afar.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
You didn't even talk to me

76
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,600
and just ignored me.

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,750
I'm a human being,

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,390
a living human being.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,430
I'm not air.

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,190
Cheng.

81
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,430
Are we going to break up?

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,630
You want to break up with me?

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
Because I didn't do a good enough job

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,390
and made you cry,

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,630
you're breaking up with me?

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
That's what you just said.

87
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,750
I did.

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,870
Why are you nervous?

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
How can I not be nervous

90
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,600
with you looking at me like that?

91
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,430
So now you're going to denounce me?

92
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,040
No, I'm not.

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm just curious.

94
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,510
What makes you think like that?

95
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,360
You've always been great.

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,830
You're Lu Sicheng.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,240
You're Chessman,

98
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,160
the god of shooter in their minds.

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
No one dared to scold you before

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,870
until I appeared,

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,190
meddling around

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,430
and making trouble.

103
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,950
If there is a troublemaker,

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,630
it would be me.

105
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,750
I'm just curious
what makes you think like that.

106
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,270
I'm not trying to break up with you.

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,870
It's because just that
you ignored me the other day.

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
I was wondering

109
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,120
whether you were mad at me.

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,390
Or maybe you're tired of me?

111
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,950
That's why I couldn't help but ask you.

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,390
If that's really the case,

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,630
at least I can dump you first

114
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,510
so that it won't be so humiliating.

115
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,000
A lot of things have happened
in the past few days.

116
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,950
I was confused.

117
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,870
And then there was
the incident where you got hurt.

118
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,360
I was so angry.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,720
But I didn't know
who was the man to be angry at.

120
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,120
So you were angry at me.

121
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,040
I wasn't.

122
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,830
I was just mad at myself.

123
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not that I didn't want to talk to you.

124
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,430
It's that I didn't know how to talk to you,

125
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,950
to make you accept me as I was.

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm not the perfect man atop of everything

127
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,480
in your heart.

128
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,040
I couldn't even protect you
in critical moments.

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,950
You thought too much.

130
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,360
What perfect man atop of everything?

131
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,600
Isn't that so?

132
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,160
I've seen you sloppy.

133
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,950
Is this the reason you broke up with me?

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I told you.

135
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,240
I didn't.

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,430
Why do you still…?

137
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,120
From now on, no matter what happens,

138
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,270
don't break up with me.

139
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,630
But I want to make a move

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,830
before you dump me.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,240
That's not gonna happen.

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,430
Don't even think about it.

143
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,920
I will take care of you
for the rest of your life.

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,950
So I'll repeat

145
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,190
the breakup thing.

146
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
Don't even think about it.

147
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,790
Hello?

148
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,960
(Hey, Yao.)

149
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,440
(Why are you still sleeping?)

150
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,390
(Look at the news link I sent you.)

151
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,480
(ZGDX e-sport club)

152
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,480
(has indicated the reason for
Tong Yao's absence from the game)

153
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,910
(is that her hand got cut
by a malicious package she received.)

154
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,790
(ZGDX condemns this kind of behavior.)

155
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,750
(We hope that fans will discipline themselves)

156
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,320
(from acting aggressively.)

157
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,390
(In response to this situation,)

158
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,480
(ZGDX will take legal action if necessary.)

159
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
Rui.

160
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,080
Well.

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,720
Wait!

162
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,510
What happened to your face?

163
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,960
Maybe I ate something bad last night.

164
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,030
It's an allergy.

165
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
Rui, is this you

166
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,320
who did the righteous thing?

167
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,600
This?

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,960
Cheng has pressured the club
to make the statement.

169
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,360
And we didn't say anything before

170
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,630
to calm the public opinion.

171
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,510
But if now

172
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,080
we don't reveal the truth to the public,

173
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
the public opinion will become
more and more outrageous.

174
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
This is even worse.

175
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:35,870
And

176
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,480
this statement really works.

177
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,080
The person who sent you
the express delivery has been found.

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,910
She is the one who sent the post

179
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,080
"How Tong Daji is made".

180
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,510
And some fans found out

181
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,360
she declared on another account that
she was going to send you a razor blade.

182
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh my god, all your fans are cursing her now.

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,630
Her blogs are going to be trending.

184
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,630
Take this and put it on.

185
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,480
It'll make it look better.

186
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,870
Don't eat anything bad in the future.

187
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,720
And

188
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,550
don't show off frequently.

189
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,870
Lu Sicheng.

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,510
Are you a stupid pig?

191
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,750
You came downstairs in your pajamas again.

192
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,670
(The poster of "How Tong Daji is made",)

193
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,440
(you made hater posts,
and sent razor blades.)

194
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,840
(What's your grudge against Smiling?)

195
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,150
(How shameless.)

196
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,150
(What's your intention in scolding Tong Yao?)

197
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,630
(And you even sent razor blades?)

198
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,030
(Are you out of your mind?)

199
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,630
(Are you very depressed in the real life?)

200
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
(Made hater posts and sent razor blades.)

201
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,390
(Blogger, the price of groceries must increase
when your mother goes out for shopping.)

202
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,320
(You must step on the stinky shit
when you go out.)

203
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,840
(You must forget to bring paper
when you go to the toilet.)

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,870
(All the Smiling fans,)

205
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,550
(don't make a scene here, okay?)

206
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,270
(Put internet violence on a blogger.)

207
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,000
(Are you humans?)

208
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,870
(Put internet violence on a little girl.)

209
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,840
(Good for you, Tong Daji.)

210
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
(Hurry up and apologize to her.)

211
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,870
(That's funny.)

212
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
(The victim hasn't yet spoken.)

213
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,630
(You guys came out
and blamed the victim first?)

214
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,080
(Does it make any sense?)

215
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,540
(ZGDX midsolo Tong Yao's fans push
internet violence on an ordinary blogger.)

216
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,940
(As you wish,
I'm going to die with recurring depression.)

217
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,670
Hello, everyone.

218
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,480
I am what you call

219
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,960
the unforgivable "Momo is a devil".

220
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,320
I posted

221
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,000
"How Tong Daji is made".

222
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,510
I am just an ordinary person.

223
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,910
I'm just an ordinary
junior high school student,

224
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,960
a loyal fan who used to

225
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,670
love ZGDX's Lu Sicheng.

226
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,600
I am also a depressed person.

227
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,960
This is the diagnosis of major depression

228
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,480
from the First People's Hospital

229
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,510
in March this year.

230
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,030
From that time to now,

231
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,510
I've been taking medicines.

232
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,910
The situation was improving.

233
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,790
But

234
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,910
your internet violence

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
has interfered with my life.

236
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,960
From the moment I suffered it,

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,670
I haven't closed my eyes for 48 hours.

238
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,750
I'm too tired

239
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,150
and disappointed.

240
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm too scared.

241
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,630
Let's end it like this.

242
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,720
Goodbye forever.

243
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,600
As you wish,

244
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm going to be driven to death by you guys

245
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
with recurring depression.

246
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
(Smiling is too hateful.)

247
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,510
(As a public figure,)

248
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,320
(how dare she allow her fans)

249
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,790
(to push internet violence
and insult an ordinary blogger?)

250
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,630
(Why don't you all step in
and calm the situation down?)

251
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,960
(Smiling and her lackeys.)

252
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,870
(It's better to let Smiling
make a public apology.)

253
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,240
(ZGDX, please deal with Smiling seriously.)

254
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,720
(I'm so confused!)

255
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,840
(How can this be the victim's fault?)

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,910
(Just because the perpetrator was depressed?)

257
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,320
(Nice moral kidnapping.)

258
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,440
(Just clicked on the video
and took a closer look at)

259
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,510
(the depression diagnosis of
"Momo is a big devil".)

260
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,550
(Test Conclusion: Major depression)
(And I surprisingly found)

261
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,200
(it seems that the test was conducted by
the psychology department of our hospital.)

262
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,440
(But we don't seem to have received her.)

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,270
(Is it possible that too many vitamins
can cause problems?)

264
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,910
(I'm scared.)

265
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,150
(The truth is not yet clear.)

266
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,270
(And you're already cursing Smiling.)

267
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,150
(Smiling's lackeys.)

268
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,320
(Go away, you accomplice.)

269
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,080
From the moment I suffered it,

270
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,600
I haven't closed my eyes for 48 hours.

271
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,360
Now it has come to this point.

272
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,870
It's no longer a petty fight
among e-sports fans

273
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,030
but a social event that has attracted
the attention of the whole society.

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,360
So we must be careful with it.

275
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,200
We must come up with the best solution.

276
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,000
Save ZGDX and the club

277
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,240
from more trouble.

278
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,510
Before the best solution is finalized,

279
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,790
in order to avoid public anger,

280
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,080
exclude Tong Yao

281
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,720
from all the recent activities of ZGDX.

282
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,240
How about this?

283
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,960
Let's let Tong Yao apologize first

284
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,150
to relieve the bad comments on the Internet.

285
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,670
Although the whole thing

286
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,510
is not directly related to Tong Yao,

287
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,440
it's more or less

288
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,550
because of her.

289
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,750
Because of her?

290
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,790
First of all, the cause of the whole thing

291
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,910
isn't Tong Yao.

292
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
But because this girl

293
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,150
sent a razor blade to Tong Yao.

294
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,200
Second of all,

295
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
the depression report this girl provided

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,840
in the video

297
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,440
is questionable.

298
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,440
Her behavior and results
in the video are questionable.

299
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,670
When the whole thing is not clear,

300
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,390
it's impossible to let Tong Yao
come out and apologize.

301
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,270
The problem is that
the public opinion is now one-sided.

302
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,080
You can't tell the truth at all.

303
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,150
Can't you tell it?

304
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,320
Whether it's true or false,

305
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,120
a phone call to the police will make it clear.

306
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,030
Is this how you

307
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,720
protect your own club member?

308
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,550
If something happens,
you push us out as shield?

309
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,390
Is that so?

310
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,910
Lu Sicheng is right.

311
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,670
In fact, there were fans who

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,150
contacted the local police

313
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,910
after "Momo is a big devil"
had released the suicide video.

314
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,440
They said they didn't receive

315
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,550
any case of junior high school student
committing suicide.

316
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,670
So we can't be sure about

317
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,320
whether this is true or not.

318
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,030
It's not

319
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,910
as simple as it seems.

320
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,310
Lu Sicheng.

321
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,200
Although

322
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Lu is the largest shareholder,

323
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,480
you don't own the club alone.

324
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,550
It doesn't matter
how you make trouble at other times.

325
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,640
But now,

326
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,240
I have to take into consideration
the collective interests of the club.

327
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,550
You can't overweigh the whole club.

328
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,000
The most important thing for us now
is to show our sincerity

329
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,590
- to calm the public opinion.
- Calm the public opinion?

330
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,350
If this is what you'll do,

331
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,750
aren't you afraid of letting the players down?

332
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,550
That's enough.

333
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,720
Save anything else.

334
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
This is the club's decision.

335
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,880
Lu Sicheng.

336
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,160
What are you doing?

337
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,750
You executives can let the ZGDX players down.

338
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,590
I can't.

339
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,030
Because I'm the captain.

340
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,000
Since you are not responsible,

341
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
I'll be completely in charge.

342
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,160
Hey, I need you to do me a favor.

343
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,830
In the next regular season,

344
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,030
we are facing

345
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,830
our old rival YQCB.

346
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,830
Through the system analysis in the last issue

347
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,310
and this data comparison chart,

348
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,270
you can see clearly

349
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,720
we and the next-door team

350
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,480
are close in overall capacity.

351
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
In terms of offense and economic efficiency,

352
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,640
we are a little bit higher.

353
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,750
But in terms of vision and resources control,

354
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,480
YQCB is a bit higher than us.

355
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,440
In the case of equal capacity of both sides,

356
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,880
we must be prepared for a long battle.

357
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,750
The toughest person of YQCB is Hierophant.

358
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
He has always played aggressively.

359
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,550
Cheng, you have to be vigilant.

360
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,000
Make sure to take shikigamis
like Komatsumaru in the BP section

361
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,880
who can carry
in the early and late stage of the game.

362
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,030
Even if it's a long battle,

363
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
you can also restrain Hierophant.

364
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Hey, go ahead.

365
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,830
Come on, let's continue.

366
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,160
(The number you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.)

367
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,830
Have you contacted Cheng?

368
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,640
No.

369
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,400
Tong Yao also called.

370
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,350
He didn't answer it.

371
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,640
That was the case yesterday.

372
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,720
Today is the same.

373
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,160
Do you think

374
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,070
the thing that happened to Tong Yao

375
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,160
still affects Cheng anyway?

376
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,160
It can't be.

377
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,680
I've been with him for so many years.

378
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
He is not

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,240
someone who would delay the training

380
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,350
and game for his own private matter.

381
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,880
If he leaves,

382
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,790
it's because there is a must.

383
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,550
Both Tong Yao and I have told him

384
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,920
today's training time.

385
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,000
I believe

386
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,160
when he wants to come back,

387
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,590
he will be back.

388
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,640
But the training is coming soon.

389
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,350
What if he doesn't come back?

390
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,350
I'll take his place for a while.

391
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,200
I'll take Komatsumaru.

392
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,160
But Ming, your hand...

393
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,070
Stop it.

394
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,310
We're about to train.

395
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,240
Don't look so sad.

396
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,030
Let's go.

397
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,160
- Well.
- I'll play a game for Cheng first.

398
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,960
Where is Cheng?

399
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,830
Cheng will definitely be back

400
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,200
in tomorrow's game.

401
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,110
Don't ask about it.

402
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,790
Come on.

403
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,350
Let's get ready to start.

404
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,550
No more questions.

405
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm taking up your time.

407
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,880
We're waiting for you.

408
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,680
Have a seat.

409
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,590
Cheng.

410
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,200
Your hand.

411
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,070
Don't worry. It's okay.

412
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,510
Okay.

413
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,920
Let's start.

414
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,000
Come on.

415
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
Let's get into the BP section.

416
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,750
Cheng, you choose Komatsumaru.

417
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,070
Chubby, choose Hotarugusa.

418
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,400
Cat, Ibaraki Douji. K, Yasha.

419
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,400
Cat, K, you guys go around the back.

420
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,400
Tong Yao, press the line.

421
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Chubby, come with me.

422
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,310
Okay.

423
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,880
Cat, K, go up.

424
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,830
Chubby, stay with me.

425
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,680
Tong Yao, go back and get your blood refilled.

426
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,640
Cheng, look out.

427
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,340
(Defeat)

428
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,640
What?

429
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,920
What's going on?

430
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
It's okay. Let's do it again.

431
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,270
We can't fight now.

432
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,590
Let's develop first.

433
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,440
Fight again after organizing ourselves.

434
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,030
Cheng, you're up so early.

435
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,750
What are you doing?

436
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,920
What am I doing?

437
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,640
I was going to ask you what you're doing.

438
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,440
You stayed up all night
last night, didn't you?

439
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,830
You were up all night ranking?

440
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,790
The doctor said you can't over-train.

441
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,270
Do you still want your hand?

442
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,440
It's okay.

443
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,000
How about you?

444
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,640
Does your hand still hurt?

445
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,030
I'm fine.

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,920
You see?

447
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,030
It's almost healed.

448
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,310
How can you practice like this?

449
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,030
I didn't play the best of Komatsumaru

450
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,510
during the training game yesterday.

451
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,920
I just wanted to play a little longer
to get a feel for it.

452
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,720
Help me finish this game.

453
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,070
I'll go up and wash my face.

454
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,200
(ZGDX vs. YQCB)

455
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,200
(Chessman and Hierophant)

456
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,000
(I'm looking forward to it!)

457
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,070
(How much is the ticket?)

458
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,110
(Is my half a month's salary enough?)

459
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,110
(I want to bring my binoculars.)

460
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,030
(I want tickets for the front row.)

461
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
(Will it be the ultimate kill of Light
or the reversal of Shadow?)

462
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
(I'm betting. I'm betting.)

463
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
(I bet on Lu Sicheng to win.)

464
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,350
Selling the tickets of
"duel between Light and Shadow".

465
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,750
Have a look.

466
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,110
Don't rob it! Don't rob it!

467
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
Selling the tickets of
"duel between Light and Shadow".

468
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,160
Don't rob it! Don't rob it!

469
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,440
There's more here.

470
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,790
Give me one. Mine.

471
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,790
Don't rob it. Give me two more.

472
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,750
Don't take it! Don't take it!

473
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,510
I want it. I want it.

474
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
I'm saving it for myself.

475
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,440
Come on, guys.

476
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,550
I paid for your coffee myself.

477
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,270
Come on, have some to cheer up.

478
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,350
Would you?

479
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,070
Where're Cheng and Ming?

480
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,030
My brother just called Ming out,

481
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,920
saying he had something to talk about.

482
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,960
I think they should be in the hallway.

483
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,640
Won't they drink coffee?

484
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,110
I'll bring it for them.

485
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,510
(No reason.)

486
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,270
(It's because I don't want to
take a shikigami for a long battle.)

487
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,240
(Youko can contain Hierophant
in the early stage.)

488
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,070
(If I don't let him develop quickly,)

489
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,000
(we might be able to finish the game
as soon as possible.)

490
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,720
(Why?)

491
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,440
(Why do you want to finish the game
as soon as possible?)

492
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,550
(I thought I told you before.)

493
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,830
(It's a tough fight.)

494
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,350
(- It's a constant battle.)
- What's wrong?

495
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,550
(Give me an explanation.)

496
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,750
(There is none.)

497
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,550
(Hierophant is my corresponding opponent.)

498
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,640
(ZGDX, please get ready.)

499
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,030
(You're about to get on the stage.)

500
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,440
Rui asked me to bring the coffee.

501
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,960
Let's go to the stage.

502
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
Let's go.

503
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:15,000
YQCB!

504
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)
(Live audience,)

505
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,200
(are you ready?)

506
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,590
YQCB!

507
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,350
The combination of
the previous Light and Shadow

508
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,200
will finally meet on the gaming field today.

509
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,270
So please bring us all a

510
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,830
battle of the century.

511
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,110
Live audience,

512
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,830
please grab the glow stick in your hands

513
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,550
and welcome them to the stage

514
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,880
with your loudest shout.

515
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,750
(First of all, please welcome YQCB.)

516
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,640
(Please welcome Ai Jia,)

517
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,160
(Liang Sheng, Kim Eun-seok,)

518
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,200
Rong and Hierophant.

519
00:28:52,270 --> 00:29:06,070
Hierophant.

520
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,830
(Since Hierophant officially joined)

521
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,070
Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

522
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,070
we have been looking forward to him.

523
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,110
The whole league

524
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,240
has finally embraced
today's cross-group battle.

525
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,070
Will this day be the victory of Light

526
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,270
or the reversal of Shadow?

527
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,160
Let's wait and see.

528
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,720
Isn't it today

529
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,790
when Smiling is back in the game?

530
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,920
Do you have to be so excited?

531
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,070
You're overly dramatic.

532
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,830
(Even if we can see Smiling
back on the field,)

533
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,550
(don't you want to see
Chessman and Hierophant's)

534
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,400
(ultimate head-to-head match?)

535
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,110
(I'm telling you.)

536
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,510
What's wrong?

537
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,270
Cheng, you...

538
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,240
(Of course I want to see it.)

539
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,350
(Actually, to be honest...)

540
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,270
Don't worry, it's fine.

541
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
(Besides the anticipation,)

542
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,640
(the matchup between
the two teams' bottom lane ADC)

543
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,030
is quite a killer.)

544
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,480
(Yes.)

545
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,400
(In this version where shooter
isn't as competent as before)

546
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
(who doesn't seem to be able to)

547
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,880
(turn the tide of a battle,)

548
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,480
(there are still two teams)

549
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,070
(in which ad weighs a lot)

550
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,920
(in Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

551
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,350
(Let's take a look at)

552
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,030
(who the winner will be.)

553
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,720
(Please welcome Cat.)

554
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,400
(K.)

555
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,030
(Chubby.)

556
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,110
(Chessman.)

557
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,750
(Smiling.)

558
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,750
Now our two teams

559
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,400
are both ready to go.

560
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,510
So next,

561
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,310
we'll ask the members of the two teams

562
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,790
return to their seats

563
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,200
to bring us a wonderful game.

564
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,550
It's really

565
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
intense here today.

566
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,270
It's as if the finals have come early.

567
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,240
Live fans.

568
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,720
You're so enthusiastic!

569
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:15,000
Hierophant! Hierophant! Hierophant!

570
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,030
(With so many fans,)

571
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,270
(Hierophant is worthy of
being the equal of Cheng.)

572
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,310
Come on!

573
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,550
We'll start in a moment.

574
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,750
Put on your headphones.

575
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,750
Okay, we can see that now the game

576
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
has entered the BP section.

577
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,720
(Let's see Smiling from ZGDX…)

578
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,480
Ban Iron Mouse.

579
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,720
(Who will she ban?)

580
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,110
Just now in the backstage,
I asked Hierophant what to play today.

581
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,590
He said he would play Iron Mouse.

582
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,830
Could he tell you the truth?

583
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,030
Can you trust his word?

584
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,240
He was lying to you.

585
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,350
Although Hierophant

586
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,550
seems to have been
practicing that shikigami lately,

587
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,550
I…

588
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,440
Listen to me.

589
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,750
Ban Iron Mouse.

590
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,030
Ban Iron Mouse.

591
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,680
Iron Mouse?

592
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,920
(Tong Yao actually banned Iron Mouse.)

593
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,110
(- ZGDX.)
- What's going on?

594
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,590
(- Is it because she's got…)
- Hierophant seems to have

595
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,590
such mixed feelings.

596
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,110
To put it simply,

597
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,550
two words,

598
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,830
you liar.

599
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,200
What's the situation?

600
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,680
Looking from their faces at this moment,

601
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,400
they seem to have practiced
the tricks of Iron Mouse.

602
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,590
Cheng, so I have to suspect

603
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,270
Hierophant will come and kill you.

604
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,590
War is always deceitful.

605
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
Give him Chin.

606
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,200
Ban Higanbana.

607
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,590
Higanbana is too competent in this version.

608
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,110
I'll choose Susabi later.

609
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,240
I'm afraid Tong Yao will contain me then.

610
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,110
Okay.

611
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,750
Sure enough.

612
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,680
ZGDX has banned Susabi

613
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,510
and Ubume.

614
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,030
YQCB has banned

615
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,960
K's famous Mannendake

616
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,590
and Smiling's Tamamo-no-Mae.

617
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,750
I wonder if Smiling

618
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,440
is to choose Ootengu again.

619
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,680
Cat, choose Ootengu for Tong Yao.

620
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,440
Okay.

621
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,240
(As expected,)

622
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,000
(ZGDX chose Ootengu)

623
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,240
(while YQCB, chose Chin and Yama Usagi.)

624
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,790
(Next, ZGDX)

625
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,550
(chose Yasha as jungler)

626
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,550
(and Ibaraki Douji as topsolo.)

627
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,160
(YQCB chose)

628
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,200
(Menreiki and Youtou Hime instead.)

629
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,790
(Now only Chessman is left.)

630
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,640
- Cheng.
(- To be reasonable,)

631
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,440
(facing YQCB's lineup,)

632
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,830
(Cheng should take Komatsumaru, right?)

633
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,590
(Yes, yes.)

634
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,880
(Komatsumaru is a relatively)

635
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,550
(safer choice.)

636
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,590
(What?)

637
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
(Youko?)

638
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,440
(Chessman once again chose Youko?)

639
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,680
(Oh my god, this is another)

640
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,350
(unexpected choice!)

641
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,640
(I hope this time Chessman)

642
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
(can still be the same as before,)

643
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,720
(getting the advantage in the early stages
of the battle and handle it quickly.)

644
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,790
Here we go.

645
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,940
(Battle)

646
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,310
Go, go, go!

647
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,550
Hello, everyone!

648
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,280
This is the last match day

649
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,440
on the fifth week in Chinese server

650
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,510
of Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

651
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,710
Today we will have

652
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,400
the first ZGDX vs. YQCB match

653
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,510
of the cross-group BO3.

654
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,670
Will the traditional powerhouse ZGDX

655
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,630
defeat YQCB's quest for victory

656
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,880
or the dark horse YQCB

657
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,230
in the national tournament

658
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,030
end ZGDX's road to godhood?

659
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,110
Let's wait and see!

660
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,710
Cat, come to the top jungle.

661
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,510
Okay.

662
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,510
Cheng, it's not safe to have the line
too deep into the turret.

663
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,440
K, come to ambush them in the bottom lane.

664
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,280
Let's go.

665
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,030
It's time for the opposite jungler
Youtou Hime to come down.

666
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,550
Chubby, check out the vision.

667
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,190
Lu Sicheng is pushing the turret very hard.

668
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,710
He won't leave even after taking the line.

669
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,000
He chose Youko
to compete with me in the early stage

670
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,510
and suppress the development of Chin.

671
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,670
Since they are playing so fiercely,

672
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,440
okay then.

673
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Kim Eun-seok, ambush.

674
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,710
Ai Jia, stay in the middle lane.

675
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,920
Be careful, their jungler must be there.

676
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,230
(K also came to the bottom lane.)

677
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,280
(Can they make it
to ambush Hierophant this time?)

678
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,630
My god, Hierophant is not
even out of the turret.

679
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,510
Kim Eun-seok's Youtou Hime

680
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,510
is also hanging around in the bottom lane.

681
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,710
There's no way they can take an advantage.

682
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,480
Let's withdraw. They have a blood advantage.

683
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Wait for our midsolo to develop.

684
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,920
Then we'll come down together.

685
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,400
(Neither the middle nor the bottom lane
is superior at the moment.)

686
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,110
(I feel like ZGDX is having
a hard time in this game.)

687
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,360
(And in the middle lane now,)

688
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,960
(Ai Jia's Menreiki is also
keeping up a steady pace.)

689
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,880
(Smiling can't take any advantage at all.)

690
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,320
It's obvious that Ai Jia
is as steady-going as a mountain,

691
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,630
ready to contain our midsolo.

692
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
What steady-going as a mountain?

693
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,440
It's obvious that he's cunning.

694
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
I can't support you at this moment.

695
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,630
It's okay, we're safely out of there.

696
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,110
Don't act rashly, bottom laners.

697
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Rong's Aobouzu

698
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,320
is also tough to deal with.

699
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,230
Today I've been stuck to

700
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Ai Jia, the dogskin plaster.

701
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,150
He's brought the sticky nature
he usually applies to Jinyang

702
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,440
to the gaming field.

703
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,840
I can't find a chance.

704
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,590
My skills are prepared.
Go back and catch them.

705
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,360
Chubby's Hotarugusa still got a control.

706
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,280
Be careful, guys.

707
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Okay, it's only been a few minutes
since the game started.

708
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,960
How many levels have you reached?

709
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,360
Don't confront them in the bottom lane.

710
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,280
Cheng.

711
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,070
We can fight with them.

712
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,150
(- Light and Shadow are in a confrontation now.)
- Don't rush.

713
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,590
Back up a little.

714
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,760
(Defeat)
A collection of heads.

715
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,550
(Can Hierophant leave?)

716
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,230
(He's gone.)

717
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,510
Chubby, control Hierophant.

718
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,030
Okay.

719
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,920
(YQCB almost lost two people.)

720
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,550
Nice, Cheng.

721
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,150
Captain is great.

722
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,960
Nice counterattack.

723
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,280
Hierophant lost this time.

724
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
Our Cheng earned 260.

725
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,000
I think you should keep a low profile.

726
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,960
Keep a low profile.

727
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,480
It's a pity.

728
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,190
Youko and Hotarugusa
are also not of full blood.

729
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,150
My support won't die in vain.

730
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,840
(Killingspree)
(What? Hierophant didn't return to the base for blood-refilling.)

731
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,190
(He crossed the turret
to force a surprise attack.)

732
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,070
(Double Kill)
(He killed little-blooded Youko and Hotarugusa.)

733
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,320
Nice, Hierophant. Awesome.

734
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,280
Hierophant's turret raid

735
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,760
has made the score
in the bottom lane from one to zero

736
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,880
to two to two.

737
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,440
They're even in gold again.

738
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,960
It seems that it's still unclear

739
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,280
who the winner of this game will be.

740
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,920
Turret raid?

741
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,030
Is it worth it?

742
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,440
I think Hierophant couldn't help it

743
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,590
seeing Cheng's little blood.

744
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,550
Hierophant was so tough using the flash.

745
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,670
If it were me, I must have conceded.

746
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,800
You are such kind of person.

747
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,110
(We see now Chessman)

748
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,360
(still in the bottom lane pressing the line.)

749
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,710
Pull back.

750
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,880
I think Kim Eun-seok is coming.

751
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,230
Let's go.

752
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,320
(- Oh my god!)
(- Yes.)

753
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,070
(Kim Eun-seok is attacking.)

754
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,150
(Chubby blocked it.)

755
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,320
(They are retreating.)

756
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,360
(Can they get away?)

757
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,510
(Can they?)

758
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,800
(- That was close.)
- I was scared to death.

759
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,510
(Kim Eun-seok's
backward movement is so obscene.)

760
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,360
(Cheng, go back to
the base for blood-refilling.)

761
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,110
My heart is about to burst

762
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,510
with you pressing the line like this.

763
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,150
Cheng's Youko

764
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,510
should be back for blood-refilling.

765
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,670
Here comes the line.

766
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,230
Lu Sicheng must be going for experience

767
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,190
and hit the turret in my absence.

768
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,070
Kim Eun-seok, don't go.

769
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,110
Keep ambushing him.

770
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,480
The line is here.

771
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,840
Let's clear the line before we go.

772
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,800
No, Kim Eun-seok didn't leave.

773
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,800
(After a while, Hierophant is back in shape.)

774
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,230
(There's a fight in the bottom lane.)

775
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,150
(Kim Eun-seok is still here.)

776
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,800
(Hierophant and Liang Sheng
both have enough blood.)

777
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,710
Be careful, Cheng.

778
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,110
Kim Eun-seok is in the bottom lane.

779
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,070
K, come to the top lane.

780
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,150
Let's destroy the top turret.

781
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,800
Don't be greedy. We won't have time.

782
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,150
Whatever, I'll go.

783
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,630
(Luckily, they ran fast.)

784
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,510
(That's right.)

785
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,880
(Look at the top lane.)

786
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,150
(K is coming up to the top lane.)

787
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,190
(Cat went up first.)

788
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,760
(He's not of full blood anymore.)

789
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,590
(K is also arriving.)

790
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,880
(Can he save Cat?)

791
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,280
(Killingspree)
Cat was killed.

792
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,670
(Shutdown)
(K didn't let go of Rong.)

793
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,480
(Turret raid.)

794
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,550
(Unfortunately, he didn't get away.)

795
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
I told you to come earlier.

796
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,400
You kept staying in the bottom lane,

797
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,960
and ganking Hierophant.

798
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,840
Will you output the damage later

799
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,070
if I didn't suppress him?

800
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,710
(This two for one is not worth it.)

801
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,320
Let's be honest,

802
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,670
the situation of ZGDX is not good.

803
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,190
It's been 11 minutes since the game started.

804
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,670
The gold gap between the two teams is 1,300.

805
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,710
- YQCB is temporarily superior.
- Yes.

806
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,710
Did you see that?

807
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,150
The topsolo and ad of

808
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,110
ZGDX

809
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,480
are having a hard time now.

810
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,360
Hierophant

811
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,360
is now containing Chessman in the bottom lane,

812
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,360
- not giving him a chance to fight.
- Yes.

813
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,510
He can't get rid of it,
but he can't get away either.

814
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,280
Now we can say that

815
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,550
the only one

816
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,230
who's developing normally of ZGDX

817
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
is Smiling

818
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,440
playing against Ai Jia.

819
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes, we can only count on her now.

820
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,630
I hope she can save the day alone.

821
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,030
Come on, let's take it.

822
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,550
Hurry up!

823
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,070
Cheng, they're hitting the monster.

824
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,000
Let go of the monster.

825
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,110
Go and destroy the middle turret.

826
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,030
I'll try.

827
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,380
(Killed off the monster)

828
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,550
Watch out!
Liang Sheng's Yama Usagi is accelerating!

829
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,630
(The flag of the monster is picked up.)
Take Hierophant behind you.

830
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,550
No, Hierophant is clearing the line too fast.

831
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,000
I can't destroy the turret.
I'll go back to the turret.

832
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,840
Hold on to it. Destroy it.

833
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,670
It's not that hard.

834
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,670
I'm going around the back.

835
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,360
You guys must be careful
not to let them scatter you.

836
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,280
Ai Jia's ult isn't refreshed.

837
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,070
Cat, you go to suffer the turret damage,
and I will get behind.

838
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,880
(A team fight.)

839
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,320
Move back! Move back!

840
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,740
(Defeat)

841
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,070
(Ai Jia was killed.)

842
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,920
Ult refreshed in three seconds.

843
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,360
The opposing jungler hasn't been exposed.

844
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,710
Put the ult at my feet.

845
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,710
I can release a set of skills too.

846
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,360
(Defeat)
(Kim Eun-seok rushed out,)

847
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,510
(trying to get to the back row)

848
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,630
(only to be controlled by Chubby)

849
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,400
(and killed by Smiling's set of skills.)

850
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,630
Go, go, go!

851
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,110
(It's not good for YQCB.)

852
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,670
(I guess they can't defend this turret.)

853
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,360
(Definitely they'll let go of it.)

854
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,150
We can't let them retreat.

855
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,000
Cat, go into the turret.

856
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,840
Yes, keep going.

857
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
(Cat rushed over.)

858
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,230
(Look, Liang Sheng is killed.)

859
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,960
(Now YQCB is down to Hierophant.)

860
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,320
(Double Kill)
(YQCB is aced.)

861
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
(YQCB has lost a lot in this team fight.)

862
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,440
(Both people and the turret are gone.)

863
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,320
(Kim Eun-seok made a mistake in positioning.)

864
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,480
Zero-for-five for ZGDX.

865
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,880
But I don't think it will happen again

866
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,960
next time.

867
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
YQCB will learn from their mistakes.

868
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,880
Protect their output.

869
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,150
If ZGDX

870
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,000
wants to kill
the opponent's output player again,

871
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,960
it won't be so easy.

872
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,760
Yes, I hope ZGDX

873
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,110
can seize this opportunity.

874
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,920
We've finally destroyed
Ai Jia's middle turret.

875
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,110
Captain, push.

876
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,550
Where are you going?

877
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,110
(Chessman is retreating?)

878
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
- (Why choose to retreat)
- Cheng.

879
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,510
(in the most advantageous situation?)

880
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,190
I don't think they can hit the Orochi now.

881
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,630
(What is Chessman thinking?)

882
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,110
They seem to have withdrawn.

883
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,030
No way.

884
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,400
Chessman doesn't want this turret.

885
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,440
He must have gone to hit the Orochi.

886
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,400
Everyone, go to the snake pit
after coming back to life.

887
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,440
- What?
- Cheng.

888
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,150
It's too dangerous
to hit the Orochi at this time, right?

889
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,400
There's not enough time to fight the Orochi

890
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,480
if we don't continue to advance at this point.

891
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,760
They've already revived.

892
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,590
Let's get out of here!

893
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,190
Go. We can't finish the fight, Cheng.

894
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Cheng, let's retreat!

895
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,360
How can we fight this?

896
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,510
Cheng, they're coming.

897
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,280
We can fight.

898
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,230
Tong Yao, go up with your ult.

899
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,360
I'll hold off Hierophant.

900
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,550
YQCB is resurrected.

901
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,400
- Won't ZGDX retreat?
- Fight.

902
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,460
(Killingspree)

903
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,360
Cheng.

904
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,510
Cheng missed.

905
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,280
It's a historic moment.

906
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,840
Cheng, I can't take it anymore.

907
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,960
What should we do?

908
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,840
- Team fight.
- My ult is prepared.

909
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,590
Up, up, up!

910
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,580
(Defeat)

911
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,760
Up, up, up!

912
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,940
(Defeat)

913
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,550
(I'm dead.)

914
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,590
(What a pity!)

915
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,550
(Chessman was so close.)

916
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,400
(If Chessman had gotten
his ult on Hierophant just now,)

917
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,230
(it'd have been different.)

918
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,000
(This is obvious)

919
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,670
(a command error of Chessman.)

920
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,960
(Yes, how can you let the midsolo
go up to pick up the team fight?)

921
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,840
(Think about it, how long can a midsolo hold?)

922
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,400
(Where is the tough shikigami?
How to fight it?)

923
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
(Yes.)

924
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,220
(Destroyed)

925
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,190
Yes!

926
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,110
Nice, nice.

927
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,000
(- Let's congratulate YQCB)
(- That was awesome!)

928
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,920
(- for winning the game.)
(- Come on.)

929
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,000
(Congratulations to YQCB!)

930
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,000
Cat.

931
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Cheng, your hand.

932
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,280
It's okay.

933
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,710
