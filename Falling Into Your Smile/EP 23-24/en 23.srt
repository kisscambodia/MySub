1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,830
I'm not young anymore

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,400
in this industry.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,910
I've been playing professionally
for many years.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,790
I've seen a lot too.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,350
In that case,

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,030
Cheng has no objection

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,240
to players falling in love?

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,750
If it's not over the top,

9
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,960
then I'm not against it.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,830
I've heard the legendary story
of a boy and a girl

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,640
getting into Tsinghua University
and Peking University together.

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,760
Do you want to do the same, Cheng?

13
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,710
I already have someone I like.

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,030
(Cheng has someone he likes?)

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,600
(I can't believe the E-sports Industry Farm
didn't catch the news.)

16
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
(E-sports Industry Farm:
That's impossible, fake news)

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,030
(There's actually something
you don't know about for once?)

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,340
=Falling into Your Smile=

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,100
=Episode 23=

20
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,920
(I know that being forced to
make up a couple should be condemned.)

21
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,120
(But I still want to say)

22
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,230
(when Cheng was saying those last few words,)

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,760
(he put his right hand under the table.)

24
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,280
(At the same time,
Smiling's hand was also under the table.)

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,920
(Cheng's hand moved.)

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,680
(So, what did you do?)

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,150
I already have someone I like.

28
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,960
What's wrong?

29
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,080
Are you shy?

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,150
Look at this.

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
(Look at the details of Cheng's hand.)

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,520
(I bet 5 cents on that
they were holding hands.)

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,310
Good for her.

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,590
What the hell is with your reaction?

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,590
This person was so observant
that she almost discovered us.

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,590
Hey.

37
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,240
What are you so nervous for?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,080
Back in the time when the E-sports were going on,
I knew they could be a couple.

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,150
What's the hell?

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,840
Cheng wouldn't fall for her.

41
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,150
She's just a gaming slut.

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,470
Cheng is giving up on himself.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm afraid she's just trying to
steal Cheng's thunder.

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,800
I don't care.
I won't agree with them to be together.

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,870
If they're together,
how could they play games in the future?

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,680
I won't watch them anymore.

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
Now you know why I covered it up.

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,590
Once exposed,

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,400
Your Majesty,

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,840
you'll lose half of your popularity.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,710
And do you know

52
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,310
why I agreed to cover it up?

53
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,500
It's for the sake of half of your popularity.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,710
Do you dare say that again?

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
I wouldn't dare.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,240
I'm afraid those crazy people
will make a slander on you,

57
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,000
saying you didn't show your best in the games

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
because you were in love

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,560
and questioning your motives
for being a pro or something like that.

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
I don't care.

61
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,190
I do care.

62
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,040
It's true.

63
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,600
It may not happen, though.

64
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,430
Even if it does,

65
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm confident that I can prove them wrong
with my gaming results.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,800
But I don't want you
to think about those things.

67
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,270
You're a person who likes to
see gossip on the internet.

68
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm sure you'll be affected.

69
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,830
It was also because of this

70
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,430
that I was hesitant about
whether we should be together.

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,560
After all, if a male member of another team

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
came after you,

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,430
I'd definitely be the first
to come up and say no.

74
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,190
I would warn that person

75
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,720
not to bother her.

76
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,430
She needs to focus on her profession.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
Then what?

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,630
What are you laughing at?

79
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,240
Leave me alone.

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,190
And then?

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,950
To celebrate winning the game,

82
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,190
I'll treat you guys to breakfasts tomorrow.

83
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,830
KFC or anything you want.

84
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,040
I'll have the pork tenderloin
with cheese and panini latte.

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
- Grilled Chicken Panini.
- Thank you. Love you.

86
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,510
And a cup of soy milk.

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,240
And I'll have the beef congee.

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
- Thank you.
- Okay.

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
What are you having, Cheng?

90
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,480
I'm not eating.

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm a little sleepy. I'm going to rest.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,680
Why am I a little hungry now?

93
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,560
Tong Yao.

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Did you leave something in my room
during the past several days?

95
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,120
No.

96
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll also have a tea egg, please.

97
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
You're a good eater.

98
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,340
(A new message from a contact)

99
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,480
(Are you sure
you didn't leave anything in my room?)

100
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,800
I think I did leave something

101
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,160
in Cheng's room.

102
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,950
I think it's my mobile power source.

103
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,190
Don't be nosy.

104
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,040
Where is he?

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,680
Cheng.

106
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,480
Do you want some breakfast?

107
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,800
I can order it for you.

108
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Panini or congee?

109
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,240
I want to eat you.

110
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,630
Captain.

111
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,310
I'm not flexible enough.

112
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,510
My waist is going to be broken.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,950
What are you hiding?

114
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not going to do anything bad to you.

115
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,510
You're dangerous.

116
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,270
Do we have to stay in this position talking?

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,750
You can lie down too.

118
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,360
Bastard.

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,190
I just wanted to thank you.

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You worked so hard
to play the four-preserving-one tactic,

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,070
showing a textbook-style performance
in an inferior game.

122
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,950
And thank you for saying
in front of the whole country

123
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,750
that you're already in love with someone.

124
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't feel your sincerity.

125
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,390
Then,

126
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
are you free tomorrow?

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,800
Yes.

128
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,950
Let's go on a date then.

129
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,920
Sure.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,430
But

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
before the date,

132
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,560
shouldn't we kiss first?

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,950
No.

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,360
See you tomorrow.

135
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
Chubby, I'll bet with you for a panini.

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,840
In less than three seconds, Cheng will appear.

137
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,750
Where are you going?

138
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,750
There's KFC breakfast

139
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,790
on the table for you.

140
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
You guys eat first,
I'm going out for shopping.

141
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,790
I'm going shopping with her.

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,670
Why do you always look like
you're going to the Civil Affairs Bureau

143
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,670
every time you go out alone?

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
I look like this every day.

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,870
So do I.

146
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,790
Forget about it.

147
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,080
The last time I saw you go out dressed up was

148
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
when you went out to the pet market

149
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,270
to buy goldfish with my brother.

150
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,030
And it seems to me
there was no time before that.

151
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,030
What's wrong?

152
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
People from the countryside
have to dress up when they go to a big city.

153
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,320
What's wrong?

154
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,030
When did you two get together?

155
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,630
I've been cheated on?

156
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,840
The shooter I raised up for so long

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,600
actually left me and went to the middle lane.

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm just kidding.

159
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,870
But I can't accept

160
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,840
my brother's future son
is as short as his mother

161
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,240
who'll be ridiculed for the rest of his life.

162
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,390
Shut up!

163
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,840
Don't laugh.

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,870
Let's go.

165
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,240
Normal people like us

166
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,960
can only grasp metal shafts all by ourselves.

167
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
What's wrong with you, all blue?

168
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,080
Lu Sicheng.

169
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,870
Why didn't you refute him just now?

170
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,840
Do you also think he has a point?

171
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,030
I'm so angry.

172
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,510
The perfect genes of your Lu family

173
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,750
are about to be tainted by my inferior genes

174
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,120
of "five feet tall".

175
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,080
Come and taint them.

176
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,630
He was teasing you.

177
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,840
You're of the same height as my mother.

178
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,600
Neither of her sons are five feet tall.

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
When our son plays basketball in the future,

180
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,270
he'll grow taller.

181
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,630
Don't worry about it.

182
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,550
Who will have a son with you?

183
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,910
A daughter is also good.

184
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Just like you.

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,120
Then she'll abduct a tall boy.

186
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,870
Perfect.

187
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,960
I actually like girls.

188
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,120
Boys are too naughty.

189
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,720
Shut up.

190
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
Can't I even fantasize about it?

191
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
No.

192
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Can you fantasize about something normal?

193
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,270
Why do I feel that
you sound like you're laughing?

194
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm not.

195
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,510
Captain.

196
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,870
Do you feel that

197
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,600
your persona has been
crumbling tremendously lately.

198
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,550
Why?

199
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
As far as I remember,

200
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,720
Chessman is a calm and collected person,

201
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,150
sharp and wise.

202
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,550
I didn't expect you to be
a shameless and glib-tongued

203
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,510
old rascal.

204
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,670
I'm very sad.

205
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,390
Do you still remember

206
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,670
what you thought

207
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
when we first met,

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,150
I took you for a delivery girl

209
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,320
and shut the door in your face?

210
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,790
You were retarded.

211
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,480
At that time,

212
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,790
I was already far from the persona

213
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,750
you thought I was.

214
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,120
But being retarded
is not the same as being a hooligan.

215
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,910
I'm a decent guy

216
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,240
in front of the other girls.

217
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Isn't that nice?

218
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,630
You can enjoy my inner personality

219
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,910
alone without restraint.

220
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,720
Rascal.

221
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,750
Yes, yes, yes.

222
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,200
That's it.

223
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,150
- I tried everything.
- Almost there.

224
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,080
I missed it.

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,390
That one.

226
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,720
Forget it, I don't want to play this.

227
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,480
The money I spent here

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,480
has been enough to buy
a bunch of the same toys online.

229
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,840
That's right.

230
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,670
But this one is really cute.

231
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,960
- I want it so bad.
- I want this one.

232
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,510
Let's buy ten of this.

233
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,200
I want the beige one.

234
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,910
I've made up my mind.

235
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
- So handsome.
- He's so cute.

236
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,150
So hot.

237
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,390
Which one do you want?

238
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
Don't we have one already?

239
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,790
This one with the hat, okay?

240
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,630
It's not the same.

241
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,320
The rabbit is difficult to clip.

242
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,120
That's right.

243
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,790
We had played for so long
and still couldn't even get it.

244
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes, it's too hard.

245
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,910
Oh, my God.

246
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,150
That's amazing.

247
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,960
- He got it.
- He got it.

248
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,080
- Good, good.
- Awesome.

249
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
Another one.

250
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
- That's terrific.
- That's so cool.

251
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,150
So cool.

252
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
I want that doll too.

253
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,790
Which one is cuter?

254
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,840
That doll is so cute.

255
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
I also want it.

256
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,360
The one in the middle.

257
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,360
What?

258
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,720
- I'm so jealous.
- It's okay.

259
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,390
I want to fall in love.

260
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,240
So romantic.

261
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
In the past when I was duped
by all kinds of doll machines

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
at the amusement park, I was thinking,

263
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,320
"I must find a capable boyfriend

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,910
in the future who will come back

265
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,750
and get them all, until they go bankrupt."

266
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,670
You did it.

267
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,390
What?

268
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,910
Found a capable boyfriend.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,670
Which amusement park is it?

270
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,360
Let's go buy tickets.

271
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
I'll go make them closed down.

272
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
Tokyo Disneyland.

273
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,510
What do you want to eat later?

274
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,720
The ice cream store down there is not bad.

275
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,030
Ice cream for lunch?

276
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,480
Why can't we have ice cream for lunch?

277
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,630
Are you three years old?

278
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,270
Am I not three years old in your mind?

279
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,510
You must love me,

280
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,390
pamper me and not cheat on me forever.

281
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,960
You guys go over there, we'll go this way.

282
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,720
Bye, we'll see you next time.

283
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
I want to go to the bathroom.
See you at the cinema later.

284
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,870
I'm going.

285
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going. Bye.

286
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,440
Bye, bye-bye.

287
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,440
Bye-bye.

288
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,390
No, nothing. Let's go.

289
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,390
Why didn't you wait for me at the cinema?

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,910
Why did you run away?

291
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,550
I saw our fans

292
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,200
in front of the sushi restaurant.

293
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,910
That's why I shook off your hand.

294
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,510
I see.

295
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
What are you doing?

296
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,320
What's wrong with you?

297
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,150
Why did you buy a mask?

298
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,720
For being considerate,
I can't reveal myself to others.

299
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,200
Lu Sicheng, say something.

300
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,150
What on earth is wrong with you?

301
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Because I'm ugly
and don't deserve to show my face.

302
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,670
Lu Sicheng, don't be upset.

303
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,200
I didn't mean that just now.

304
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,670
What?

305
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Okay, okay.

306
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm sorry, okay?

307
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,320
Can you let me go this time?

308
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,870
The fans were there.

309
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,390
If they see us walking around
hand in hand like that, what will they think?

310
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,630
Remember when I showed you those

311
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,790
fans' comments?

312
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,720
They don't accept that you have a girlfriend.

313
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,440
They don't accept.

314
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,510
I don't care.

315
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,310
Give me back my mask.

316
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,200
You don't care, but I do.

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,790
I'm not afraid of them

318
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,720
treating me like they did to Chen Jinyang.

319
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,160
And I'm not afraid that they'll say
I don't focus on my career and

320
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,790
all I care about is seducing their idol.

321
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,000
I just know that
since you played as a professional player,

322
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,310
no one has ever said anything bad about you,

323
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,510
even the E-sports Industry Farm,

324
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,160
which specializes in
digging out scandals of the players.

325
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,790
So?

326
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,830
So, I will not allow myself

327
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,750
to become an excuse for others to condemn you.

328
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,480
You are.

329
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,790
Everyone has his own weakness.

330
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,830
Me too.

331
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
It's you.

332
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,590
I don't care what people say about me.

333
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,590
If they say something positive about me,

334
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm happy about it.

335
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,310
But I won't act differently because of

336
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,510
their moral abduction.

337
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,000
"Word of mouth"

338
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,400
is generated by my actions,

339
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,640
and it not because I generate
the corresponding behavior

340
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,350
for it.

341
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Do you understand what I mean?

342
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,960
I just fell in love with a little girl.

343
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
I'm not doing anything wrong.

344
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,920
Why are you always so concerned to protect me?

345
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,070
Let's go.

346
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,750
That was too fast just now.

347
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,510
I didn't get to savor it.

348
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,790
Why don't we do it again?

349
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,270
What's with your reaction?

350
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
Expressing my disappointment.

351
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,350
I should tell you
Xiamen is a really good place.

352
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,400
We have so much time to play

353
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,920
and so little time to work.

354
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
There are big waves, and gyms

355
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,110
where you can take great pictures,
and there is even spa.

356
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,590
Really, that's terrific.

357
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,720
You two went to Las Vegas

358
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,920
to get married, right?

359
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
You're back so late.

360
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,550
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

361
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,640
Since you two are back,

362
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
I have to tell you something.

363
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,400
The club has arranged for us
to attend an event.

364
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,110
It's very simple.

365
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,750
It's just a fan meeting.

366
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,310
Just take a video
and regard it as a kind of entertainment.

367
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
If you don't want to go,

368
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,310
I'll have to cancel our tickets to Xiamen.

369
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,550
- Canceled.
- What?

370
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,750
Where to?

371
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Xiamen?

372
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,200
If we don't go,

373
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,000
we will miss out on

374
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,960
a chance to get in touch with the great food,

375
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,680
and to

376
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,270
have close contact with a beautiful city.

377
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
What a pity!

378
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,160
Such a pity.

379
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,030
No, no.

380
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,590
Is our hotel far from the night market?

381
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,110
Did you get the event schedule?

382
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,030
What time is the meeting?
What time do we get off work?

383
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,480
It's not good if the night market
closes before we get off work.

384
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,830
Don't drag on when we are there.

385
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,240
Say whatever you want,

386
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,880
it's up to Cheng
to decide whether to go or not.

387
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,200
Cheng, are we going?

388
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Yes.

389
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,440
It looks really good.

390
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,720
- That's right.
- Why can't we go?

391
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,880
K.

392
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,110
Hurry up, don't indulge in playing.

393
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,270
- I see.
- I wonder when the afternoon activity

394
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,680
- will end.
- Let me finish this game first.

395
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,270
You suck at it.

396
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,350
Not as much as you do.

397
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,830
Listen.

398
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,750
My playlist?

399
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,830
There's a problem with the club booking.

400
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,400
The room will not be ready
until eight o'clock.

401
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,200
Don't worry, guys.

402
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,830
I just read the reviews.

403
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,270
The restaurant at this hotel
is of a very high rating.

404
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,920
How about we go get something to eat?

405
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,590
Yeah, sure.

406
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

407
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,000
- Good idea.
- Let's go.

408
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,750
Come on, let's go.

409
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,350
Cheng.

410
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,110
Take my suitcase upstairs for me.

411
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,750
I'll go make a phone call
to my mom saying I'm safe.

412
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,920
Say hello to mom for me.

413
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
Hello, Mom?

414
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes, we've arrived in Xiamen.

415
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,160
It's fine.

416
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,680
It's just a bit rainy.

417
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,750
You don't have to worry.

418
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,640
I have to go now.

419
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,000
Miss, are you Smiling?

420
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,310
Yes, you are?

421
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,680
It's really you.

422
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm a fan of yours, a fan.

423
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,240
Before you played as a professional player,

424
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,070
I already liked your live streaming so much.

425
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,310
I also play midsolo.

426
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,880
I've learned a lot of skills from you.

427
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,310
My current ranking is not bad.

428
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,920
If it gets a bit higher,
I think I may run into you in the game.

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,510
My dream is to play a game with you.

430
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,550
Miss, can I get your autograph?

431
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,640
Sure.

432
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,350
Yang.

433
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,550
You wandered off again in my negligence,

434
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,830
and talked to people you don't know.

435
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,510
Can't you just let me rest assured?

436
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,030
I didn't wander off.

437
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
I didn't talk to a stranger either.

438
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,070
She is

439
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,000
my favorite e-sports player.

440
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,160
What player?

441
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,200
E-sports player.

442
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,160
Okay, okay. What e-sports?

443
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,440
It's just playing games.

444
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,960
You kids

445
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,680
are not only get addicted to games
and lag behind in your studies,

446
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,750
but also make high-sounding excuses.

447
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,880
Let's go.

448
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Smiling.

449
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,350
I also want to play pro
and want to win the championship.

450
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,310
I'm counting on you

451
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
for this year's national finals championship.

452
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,830
See you later, Smiling.

453
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,880
All right, let's go.

454
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,640
All right, don't wander off anymore.

455
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,550
Why are you here?

456
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,920
You have disappeared for 30 minutes.

457
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,440
I thought you'd been kidnapped.

458
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,310
I don't have any money.

459
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,720
I've just played professionally
for three months,

460
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,440
with three months' salary deducted.

461
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
I have a debt.

462
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,270
I have money.

463
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,160
What if you're kidnapped
and I'm being asked for the ransom?

464
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,550
I'd have to pay
even if it's five million yuan.

465
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,830
Who was that kid?

466
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,480
A little fan.

467
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,110
What did he say?

468
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,160
He wanted an autograph.

469
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,030
He said he wanted to play professionally too.

470
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,480
But his career was ganked by his mother.

471
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,550
Let me ask you a question.

472
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,480
Do I pass my probationary period?

473
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,510
I'm just having a yogurt and taking a walk.

474
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,640
Why do I have to reveal
the mystery of the century,

475
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,750
so unprepared?

476
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,440
What's wrong with you guys?

477
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,400
I'm just a cute, fat guy.

478
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,920
What?

479
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
You want to kill me?

480
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Actually, I don't have anything to ask.

481
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,000
How long have you two been like this?

482
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
For a while.

483
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,110
You've been hiding it well.

484
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,270
No one has found out.

485
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,240
So

486
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,110
who escalated your pure friendship first?

487
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,640
Me.

488
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I threatened her.

489
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,310
If she didn't accept,

490
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
I would throw her cat away.

491
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,920
So she gave in.

492
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,400
Are you satisfied with my answer?

493
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,110
That's not right.

494
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,350
She's the only girl on the team.

495
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,550
We pamper and protect her.

496
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,790
As the captain of the team,

497
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,960
you just came onto her alone behind our back.

498
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,200
Should I leave her to you instead?

499
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,110
You…

500
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,110
I am the captain,

501
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
not Lei Feng.

502
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
And you, Tong Yao.

503
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,160
I thought you agreed to
focus on your professional career,

504
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,720
not to fall in love with
a professional e-sports player

505
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,310
and accused all professional players
of being scumbags.

506
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,880
You just go back on your word like this?

507
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,720
Captain is not Jian Yang.

508
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,110
He doesn't lie.

509
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,030
Usually, he just watches game videos

510
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,350
and plays rankings or something.

511
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
Now I can feel more and more

512
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,240
public display of affection atmosphere.

513
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
How did you two fall in love?

514
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't know.

515
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,750
Just started to feel good about
each other while cursing at each other.

516
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,830
Have you heard of the Stockholm syndrome?

517
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,110
It was cute

518
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,160
when you stood on your tiptoes
to hide water in the supermarket.

519
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,200
It's cute when you play games.

520
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,310
It was cute

521
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,110
when you sat alone, crying all night,

522
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,070
and practiced the Shikigami all night long

523
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,000
after you were defeated by
Tai's Tamamo-no-Mae.

524
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
It was cute

525
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,790
when you talked nonsense

526
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,720
to Yang rudely

527
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,750
after winning the game.

528
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,790
It was even cuter
when you beat me in the Solo game

529
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,510
and looked arrogant.

530
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,830
I'm just asking.

531
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
I can list many more.

532
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,440
Save it for your officiant

533
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,070
in the church.

534
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,070
Don't you want to hear it?

535
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,480
One last question.

536
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,550
How intimate

537
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,680
have you gotten?

538
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,440
Just a kiss as you saw, nothing more.

539
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,510
What else do you want to ask?

540
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I'll tell you everything.

541
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,960
No more, no more.

542
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,880
leave me alone for a while.

543
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,790
Go, go, go.

544
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,640
You guys go first.

545
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,960
Go far away.

546
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,550
By the way, I've run out of spray.

547
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm going to buy some spray.

548
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,480
No way.

549
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,310
From now on,
if you want anything, just tell me.

550
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
I'll go buy it for you.

551
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,960
I've been your support for two years.

552
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,350
You didn't even buy me a face cleanser.

553
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,750
- Don't be late tomorrow morning.
- I'll go to my room first.

554
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,070
- Okay.
- Don't be late in the morning.

555
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,060
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

556
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,110
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

557
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,350
Where are we going to play

558
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,350
after the video shooting tomorrow?

559
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Where do you want to go?

560
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,720
Let's go eat some nice food.

561
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,440
Sure.

562
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,960
Tong Yao.

563
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,750
Are you going to share one room tonight?

564
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,980
(Lu Sicheng)

565
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,440
What's wrong?

566
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,830
What are you doing?

567
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,550
I just finished applying a facial mask.

568
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,960
I have to get up early tomorrow.

569
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,830
I'm so sleepy.

570
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I feel like I'm going to
fall asleep any minute.

571
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,830
Lock the door.

572
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,310
Put a stool at the door.

573
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Is it to protect against thieves or you?

574
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,830
Against me.

575
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,270
All right, I have to go.

576
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,110
Bye-bye.

577
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,480
My private life

578
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,110
is entirely filled with
your public display of affection.

579
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,720
I'll just eat my dried pork.

580
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,270
Are you done?

581
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,550
Thinking of

582
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,350
the scene that shocked my heart

583
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,110
today in the hotel lobby,

584
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,550
I couldn't calm down for a long time.

585
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,000
I can only take it out on you.

586
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,680
I regard Tong Yao as my teammate

587
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,030
while you want to take her
as your girlfriend.

588
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,240
Cheng.

589
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,310
Tong Yao is a good girl.

590
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,750
Look at Yang,

591
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,750
Guang and Lee Hang Suk.

592
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,510
They all like our midsolo.

593
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,350
If they didn't want to win the game,

594
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,000
they probably wouldn't have even come to gank.

595
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,270
If you don't treat Tong Yao right,

596
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,270
half of the twelve teams' junglers

597
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,550
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League

598
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,920
will live in our bottom lane.

599
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,550
It doesn't matter if they hurt you.

600
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,830
Don't forget that there's a cute me
in the bottom lane as well.

601
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,350
Two lives lost at one time.

602
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,310
What are you trying to say?

603
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,510
Cheng.

604
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,550
You have a lot of competitors.

605
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,400
Don't become arrogant
just because you're handsome.

606
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,000
I wouldn't.

607
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,000
When we first got together,

608
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,310
I wanted to tell the world that

609
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,550
I already have a girlfriend.

610
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,590
But she wouldn't let me.

611
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,270
Why not?

612
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,240
At first, I thought it was better
not to make it public.

613
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,550
I was afraid that it would affect
her performance in the game.

614
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,480
But then I realized

615
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,350
her skill has been recognized.

616
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,240
Now if someone comes out and says

617
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,880
she can't do this or that,

618
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,310
that'll be a slap in his own face.

619
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,070
The record of winning
all the group matches so far

620
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,030
means that Tong Yao is perfectly qualified for

621
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,920
our midsolo position

622
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,510
and has kept up with our pace.

623
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,510
However, while I was wondering

624
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,680
how to make the story public,

625
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,920
there was an accident between
Ai Jia from next-door's team and Jinyang.

626
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
It was quite severe,

627
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,880
so severe that my fans

628
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,030
also went to the E-sports Industry Farm
to join in on the fun.

629
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,270
And she saw it.

630
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,550
Now she always thinks

631
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,110
if I announce our relationship,

632
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,310
I will have no fans.

633
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,590
Young girls love to think wildly.

634
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,240
Does the new face cleanser work well?

635
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,200
Yes, it works.

636
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,510
You're even jealous of the face cleanser?

637
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,590
You jealous husband.

638
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,440
It was sent to me for you.

639
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,000
Cheng.

640
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,270
What do you really like about Tong Yao?

641
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,030
Frankly speaking,

642
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,240
Tong Yao

643
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,790
is only average looking,

644
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,830
compared to your pretty fans

645
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,550
who could form a company of their own.

646
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,110
Because she is capable.

647
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,720
Perfunctory.

648
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,270
She is also very cute when she cries.

649
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,030
Pervert.

650
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,880
And?

651
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll definitely try my best.

652
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,030
So can I call you Cheng?

653
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,880
Who are you thinking of?

654
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,670
That's the smell.

655
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,480
I don't know where it comes from,

656
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,320
but I'm deep in love.

657
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,820
(Roly Poly)

658
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,710
(The sound of your man evaluating you.)

659
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,400
(Listen to it.)

660
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,360
(It's very flirty, thank me now.)

661
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,880
(Recording)
(I don't know where it comes from,)

662
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,070
(but I'm deep in love.)

663
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,630
(I don't know where it comes from,)

664
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,760
(but I'm deep in love.)

665
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,700
(Amao's mom)

666
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,190
You're really getting up?

667
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,110
Make me look around your room.

668
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,760
Let me see if there's anyone else.

669
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,070
No, no.

670
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
I'm all alone.

671
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,480
Then why is your face

672
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,280
looking so flushed and soft?

673
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,630
It's like you've got something going on.

674
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,630
What?

675
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,630
That's because of the facial mask
I put on last night, okay?

676
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,880
You look radiant because you're in love.

677
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,030
Keep it up.

678
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,190
Aren't you going out with Ai Jia today?

679
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,280
Why aren't you dressed up?

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm not going.

681
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,150
Why?

682
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, actually

683
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,670
I've been thinking about it a lot these days.

684
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,670
I think what they said about this problem

685
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,880
is actually correct.

686
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,110
Which one?

687
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,360
Who do you want to mock at and attack?

688
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,070
No.

689
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,190
I'm serious.

690
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,920
I'm really not as good as you are

691
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,150
at being on the same page with the boyfriend.

692
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,110
In the eyes of the fans,

693
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm just a character to Ai Jia

694
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,880
with no support functions.

695
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,320
Support?

696
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,630
Do you even play the game?

697
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,920
What kind of support are you?

698
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,760
Forget about playing games.

699
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,030
But I can do something else.

700
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,550
For example?

701
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,320
For example, buy his team for him.

702
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,840
Give him a salary increase or something.

703
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,030
Then when his fans

704
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,230
see him, they will think

705
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,030
even the shampoo for each strand of

706
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,030
such a handsome man's hair

707
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,440
is bought with his salary

708
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,960
paid off by that annoying woman.

709
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,710
But he can't live without the salary.

710
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,150
What can they do?

711
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,440
They can't help it.

712
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,280
So angry.

713
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,030
I don't deserve to experience
rich people's happiness.

714
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,000
I just like this kind of feeling,

715
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,550
that they hate me
but can do nothing about me.

716
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,000
You can't be serious.

717
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,070
Maybe.

718
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,920
By the way,

719
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,670
aren't you going to make a vlog today?

720
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Go get dressed up.

721
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,670
Don't make me look bad.

722
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,670
Okay, okay.

723
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,030
Bye-bye.

724
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,710
We just finished the fan meeting.

725
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,280
The fans in Xiamen are really enthusiastic.

726
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,710
Now we're on the food street.

727
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,480
We're going to eat.

728
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,110
I don't know where they all went.

729
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,960
Let me look for

730
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,550
your favorite Cheng.

731
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,710
Where's Cheng?

732
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,110
Where's Cheng?

733
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,480
Our Cheng is…

734
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,110
It smells so good.

735
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,800
What's that smell?

736
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,110
It's dried pork.

737
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,110
Chubby shot us. What should we do?

738
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,710
It's not a live stream, don't worry.

739
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,000
I'll have him delete it later.

740
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,360
Delete it.

741
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,030
Delete what?

742
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,840
I'll keep it for myself, won't I?

743
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,150
Tell me, how are you going to shut me up?

744
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,840
What do you have up your sleeve this time?

745
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,110
I think it's not going to pass

746
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,920
without dried pork.

747
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,710
Welcome.

748
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,920
Hundreds of high-end snacks for you
to choose from.

749
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,320
What would you two like to have?

750
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,400
We'll choose ourselves.

751
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,150
Okay.

752
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,920
This one.

753
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,320
- Get it, get it.
- Get it, get it.

754
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,710
We're here to buy snacks for Chubby.

755
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,110
Aren't you afraid
you're gonna get fat from this?

756
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,960
Don't worry, sir.

757
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,710
Our snacks are all made from
the best ingredients.

758
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,760
They're tasty and won't make you gain weight.

759
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,960
Did you hear that?

760
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,070
Get us two boxes of dried pork, please.

761
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,150
Okay.

762
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,800
Dried mangoes.

763
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,150
I want some.

764
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,000
You're like a rabbit.

765
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,960
- Give it to me.
- I won't.

766
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,630
- Give it to me.
- I won't.

767
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
You're a bully because you're tall, right?

768
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,480
A rabbit bites when it's desperate.

769
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,590
- No.
- Give it to me.

770
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,030
- I won't give it to you.
- Give it to me.

771
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,000
I won't.

772
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,880
Lu Sicheng.

773
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,760
No.

774
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,000
Well.

775
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,550
Here's the dried pork for you two.

776
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

777
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,800
Then take your time.

778
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,880
Call me if you need anything.

779
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,550
Okay.

780
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,400
Give it to me.

781
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,590
Mind your appearance.

782
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,760
See? They're coming out.

783
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,630
Hello, who are you looking for?

784
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,280
- Is he the one?
- We're looking for him.

785
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,230
Bastard.

786
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,590
Get your ass over here.

787
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,440
Why didn't you answer your phone?

788
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,710
How dare you not answer my call?

789
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,880
I've called you so many times.

790
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Where are you going?

791
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,590
- Why are you running away?
- You dare run away?

792
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,670
Uncle, aunt.

793
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,070
Did you hear me? Come back here!

794
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,480
- Calm down.
- I told you to come back to me.

795
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,880
Get in first, uncle.

796
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,360
- I'm so pissed.
- Let's go.

797
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
