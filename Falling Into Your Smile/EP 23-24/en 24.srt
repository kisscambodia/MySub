1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,120
(People are always used to judging new things)

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,960
(by experience.)

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,590
And at first my parents didn't agree either.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,750
The same with my parents.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,080
My parents also didn't quite agree.

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,190
It's normal.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,430
Among us,

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,240
except for K

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,960
who has never mentioned his parents,

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,280
the parents of the others
are all quite assertive that

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,480
they are against it.

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,320
What's so interesting about that?

13
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,600
Your parents aren't
supportive of you playing e-sports?

14
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,760
My dad is all right.

15
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,480
My mom...

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,190
(Subconsciously accuse it.)

17
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,510
What e-sports?

18
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,760
It's just playing games.

19
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,030
You kids

20
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,670
are not only addicted to games
and lag behind in your studies,

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
but also find high-sounding excuses.

22
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,840
(Refuse it.)

23
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,470
Get your ass over here.

24
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,280
Bastard.

25
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,880
(Few people believe in their passion,)

26
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,390
(nor do they understand)

27
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,150
(what this love means)

28
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,520
(to them.)

29
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,000
How dare you not answer my call?

30
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,320
Come back!

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,520
- No, no.
- You come back to me.

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,620
=Falling into Your Smile=

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,380
=Episode 24=

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
Come on, Auntie, Uncle. Please have some tea.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,030
You're here for…?

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,840
That brat.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,910
Pig brain.

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,590
He ran away when he saw me.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
You go get that brat over here.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
Don't be angry.

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,680
What exactly do you want from K?

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,750
Boss.

43
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,560
No, no, no.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
- We.
- Rui.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
Just call me Rui.

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,430
Boss Rui.

47
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,680
It's like this.

48
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,800
Nowadays, the national policy is better for us.

49
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,120
Our township

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
has given us an extra piece of land.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,960
This boy's brother just got married.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,470
We are considering building a new house

53
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,630
for his brother.

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,710
He can't live with us

55
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,590
all the time.

56
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,680
Don't you think so?

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,470
Yes, yes.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,520
Young people do need their own space.

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,960
A few years ago,

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,310
his father injured his right hand

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
at work.

62
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,630
Now he can't do any heavy work.

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,750
Can't find a job either.

64
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
All kinds of things in the family,

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
big or trivial,

66
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,120
all require money.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Think about it.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
Where can we get the money?

69
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,240
Yes.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
We also know

71
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,630
it's not easy for him

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,870
to work far away from hometown.

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,470
What's not easy for him?

74
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,470
His brother lives in the countryside.
How can he compare with him?

75
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,560
Now,

76
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,840
his brother is desperate for money.

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,470
He wants to build the house.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
We just wanted to borrow some money from him.

79
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,630
Why wouldn't he want to help him?

80
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,280
He didn't even answer our phone calls.

81
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,400
Now he's not happy about it.

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,240
We can't even see him, think about it.

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,190
Who does he think he is?

84
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,520
We are his parents.

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,870
How could he not answer the phone?

86
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,960
As soon as he saw me, he ran away.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
It hurts us!

88
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,150
But then again,

89
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,240
if we had choice,

90
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
I wouldn't have come here to find him.

91
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,560
You are the leader of my child, right?

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,590
Kind of.

93
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,710
It's good that you were there just now.

94
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,960
I just want to ask you,

95
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,800
how much money can he earn from

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,080
the games he plays?

97
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,030
Well.

98
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,150
We have signed a contract with the players.

99
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,870
The salary is confidential to the public.

100
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,870
In theory,

101
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,360
it should be him to tell you that.

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,150
I'm not supposed to say it.

103
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,840
What's confidential?

104
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
I am his father.

105
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Everything he owns is given
by me and his mother.

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,870
That's right.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,150
I just want to know,

108
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,280
how much money can he earn from

109
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,190
the games he plays?

110
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,000
Well.

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,750
I'm really not supposed to say it.

112
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,510
Stop it.

113
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,270
This is all the savings I've had
since I started playing professionally.

114
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,480
In addition to the money
I give you every month

115
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,190
and my daily expenses,

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
the rest is all here.

117
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,560
You can take it all.

118
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,120
Do whatever you want to do.

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
Build a house for him.

120
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
Pay a bride price.

121
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,160
Go gambling.

122
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,160
Waste it all.

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,310
There is no need to make up so many reasons.

124
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,510
Now all this is yours.

125
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,310
Dad.

126
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,040
Mom.

127
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,630
I really thank you for raising me.

128
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,190
But I ask you not to come to the base anymore.

129
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,560
Don't bother me

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,390
and my teammates here again.

131
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,830
You brat.

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
What are you doing?

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,070
K.

134
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,430
Rui.

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,310
Please

136
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,870
book tickets for their return trip.

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
Deduct the money from my next month's salary.

138
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
This brat is becoming
more and more disobedient.

139
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,480
How can he do this?

140
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,680
(Once you throw it away,)

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,630
(you may never get it back.)

142
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,750
There are things that
you don't want to get back.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,870
Ever since I was a kid,

144
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,560
everything I do has always been wrong

145
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,830
while my brother has always been right.

146
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,750
When I wanted to study,
he told me I wasn't cut out for it.

147
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
I was told to learn a trade
and work with my father.

148
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,600
I didn't want to.

149
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,310
I wanted to go to school.

150
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,040
That's when I developed
my game-playing skills,

151
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
making money by playing for others.

152
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,000
Tong Yao.

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
You know what?

154
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,560
In fact, at that time,

155
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,190
I didn't like playing games at all.

156
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,270
I thought it was just a tool to make money.

157
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,630
If I hadn't met Ming later,

158
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,630
I might never have known

159
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,070
what e-sports was.

160
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Then I got into it.

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
I understood it.

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,920
But to my parents,

163
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,190
it was still just a tool to make money.

164
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,240
Actually, it's understandable, right?

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
We just need to communicate more

166
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,920
with the older generation.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,160
My parents are the same.

168
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,950
Haven't you seen them?

169
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,950
Tong Yao.

170
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,390
We're not the same.

171
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
How?

172
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,390
Your parents are good.

173
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,190
They love you very much,

174
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,040
while my parents…

175
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,950
So now I really have nothing

176
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,870
except for e-sports.

177
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,070
You still have us.

178
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,000
Tong Yao.

179
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,510
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,790
I was against you before.

181
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,270
And what I said

182
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,600
when your parents came to the base.

183
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,390
It's been so long.

184
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,720
Why do you still remember?

185
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
I've long forgotten it.

186
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,030
Let's go, K.

187
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,200
Let's go back to the base.

188
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,790
Why did you call me here so early?

189
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,960
Yao, I'm impulsive.

190
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,000
What's wrong?

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,080
Come, I'll show you.

192
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,750
Look at this.

193
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,260
(YQCB e-Sports Club Equity Transfer Agreement)

194
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,440
What's this?

195
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
The Equity Transfer Agreement of YQCB.

196
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,460
(Assignee: Chen Jinyang)

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,200
Transferee, Chen Jinyang?

198
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,870
You really bought YQCB?

199
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,750
Of course it's true.

200
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,200
Could I forge that?

201
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,320
Boss, I bought the RIO you wanted.

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,030
What flavor do you want?

203
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,150
Peach flavor.

204
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,390
She... She really bought your team?

205
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,790
Of course she did.

206
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,270
She's now the owner and manager of our team.

207
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,150
This...

208
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
Does this make sense?

209
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,840
Yes, it does.

210
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,480
I've thought about it carefully.

211
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,360
Although

212
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
I have no talent for games.

213
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,910
And I don't know anything about this industry.

214
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,360
But no one can deny that I'm smart.

215
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,390
Everything can be learned.

216
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,600
And I also think

217
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,550
the e-sports industry is promising.

218
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,440
My dad also thinks

219
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
it's a very promising investment.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
My honey is smart.

221
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,390
Of course.

222
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,030
I'll go back and digest the news first.

223
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,080
Don' go.

224
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,440
I still have something to discuss with you.

225
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,840
What is it?

226
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,320
Didn't you tell me last time

227
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,120
K's parents came to the base?

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,200
I found out later

229
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
many parents are just like his parents.

230
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,790
They think e-sports is just playing games

231
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,720
through which they can make
a lot of easy money.

232
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,270
Ai Jia thought the same way before.

233
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,840
Don't mention me.

234
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
Although I used to love to play games,

235
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,630
ever since I've started
playing professionally,

236
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I find it's too hard.

237
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,840
It is.

238
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,270
There is no such thing as

239
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,480
playing and making easy money
at the same time.

240
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,480
Many people can't see

241
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,670
the pain and pressure
behind professional players.

242
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,440
That's why there are so many parents

243
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,390
who don't understand
their children playing e-sports.

244
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Bestie, you've grown up.

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
Of course.

246
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,080
Do you think I'm just

247
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,000
a boss who would have
a relationship with the players?

248
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,440
And

249
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
ever since I bought the team,

250
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,630
I've always had an idea.

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,480
I must do something for the team.

252
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,750
So

253
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,630
I now have a great idea.

254
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,960
You,

255
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,870
you don't want to buy ZGDX too, do you?

256
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
And then unify the gaming world?

257
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm not as rich as Cheng.

258
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm planning to

259
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,480
hold a carnival for you and Ai Jia.

260
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,870
A carnival?

261
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,360
Why are we going?

262
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,240
We're going to the event
held by the next-door team?

263
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,270
Because that's me and Ai Jia's alma mater.

264
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,030
So I have to go.

265
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,630
Well.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,910
That's not appropriate, is it?

267
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,270
We have such a tight schedule these days.

268
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,840
Carnival.

269
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,360
I told Cheng about the last event

270
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,670
and he didn't even agree.

271
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,240
I'm sure he…

272
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,150
Okay.

273
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,510
Okay.

274
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,870
Carnival?

275
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,480
Tong Yao,

276
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,720
is the cafeteria of your alma mater good?

277
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,360
Foodie.

278
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,840
University carnival?

279
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,630
Is that a show?

280
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
Douchebag.

281
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,840
This is a stage to show the charm

282
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
and ecology of e-sports.

283
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,320
Look at all of you,

284
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,960
staying up late every night for training.

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,670
Either you have dark circles under your eyes

286
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,510
or dry and rough skin.

287
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,910
Where's the charm?

288
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,630
Tong Yao.

289
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,910
Your recent skin condition
is also not so good.

290
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,200
I've recently been using a hydrating mask.

291
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,960
It's excellent for moisturizing.

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,910
Why don't you try it too?

293
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,510
Come on.

294
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,440
Try it yourself tonight.

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
Okay, I'll try it after I go back.

296
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,550
I'm sure you'll be able to

297
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,320
face everyone

298
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,550
in your best state.

299
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,580
(E-Sports Carnival)

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,670
(Shen Gang University)
Today, we are honored to invite

301
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,750
two current members of

302
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,000
(E-sports Carnival)
famous gaming teams, ZGDX and YQCB

303
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,270
to our event today.

304
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,480
And now

305
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,240
let's give a warm applause

306
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,240
to YQCB's manager

307
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Chen Jinyang.

308
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,440
Ai Jia.

309
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,150
Tong Yao.

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
All right, please take your seats.

311
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,030
Okay, now it's time for audience interaction.

312
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,000
Are there any students who want to
ask questions to your senior schoolmates?

313
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
You can raise your hand.

314
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,270
Okay, this girl.

315
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,840
Hello, Tong Yao.

316
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,870
I'd like to ask you a question.

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,630
Did you go into playing games

318
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,510
because of the games themselves

319
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,440
or because of your boyfriend at the time?

320
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,550
It was indeed him

321
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,630
who brought me into the gaming world.

322
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,000
But it was me

323
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,720
who took up e-sports

324
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,000
as a profession and a dream.

325
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,320
So in a relationship,

326
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,390
if one person likes to play games

327
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,030
while the other hates it,

328
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,630
does that mean

329
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,600
they are destined not to be together?

330
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
I'll answer this question.

331
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,150
I believe that in this world

332
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,390
there are no two people
who are exactly the same,

333
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,030
especially between lovers.

334
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,600
Just like

335
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,120
me and Ai Jia.

336
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,720
One of us

337
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,960
is a professional player
who is expected to reach the Finals,

338
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
while the other is just a girl
spending money on game skins

339
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,790
who doesn't even know

340
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,750
what equipment to buy in a game.

341
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,480
I really don't like to play games.

342
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,200
Like many girls,

343
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,630
I don't understand the fun of sitting
in front of the computer for hours,

344
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,080
just tapping a few keys back and forth.

345
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,030
Of course.

346
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,630
Ai Jia doesn't understand

347
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,630
what I do either.

348
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,550
He doesn't understand
why I only have two feet,

349
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,510
but have two hundred pairs of shoes.

350
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,510
I only have one mouth,

351
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,080
but have 500 lipsticks.

352
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
And they look all almost the same.

353
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,120
But he still praises.

354
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,150
Even if he's in front of the computer
for ten hours a day,

355
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,550
he can still tell

356
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,080
I've changed my hairstyle and colored it.

357
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,270
My clothes look better today
than they did yesterday.

358
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,360
His attention to me

359
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,670
never gets taken away by the game.

360
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,320
So do I.

361
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
I don't know the game.

362
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,000
But I know

363
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,910
e-sports is a kind of sportsmanship.

364
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
It's not just about

365
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,240
hiding in the game, flaunting one's ability.

366
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
He has just changed a way

367
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,840
to prove his strength to the world.

368
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,000
Just like now,

369
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,440
Ai Jia's taste has improved dramatically.

370
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,360
And I

371
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,750
have also found the direction
of my future career.

372
00:16:52,750 --> 00:17:00,360
Okay.

373
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,670
Okay, any more questions from the students?

374
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,270
This female student.

375
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
I'd like to ask you a question, Miss Tong Yao.

376
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,830
How did you manage to
become the Lord of Kyoto in the game

377
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,400
and at the same time,
still be able to balance your studies

378
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,790
and be an outstanding graduate?

379
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,110
I think it's a matter of
scheduling your time wisely.

380
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,310
Choose your priorities in accordance with

381
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,070
your status.

382
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
If you're a student,

383
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,200
you have to

384
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,830
finish all your classes

385
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,550
before planning your time wisely.

386
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,110
Nothing can be an excuse.

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,030
So when I was a student,

388
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,550
I studied twice as hard.

389
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,510
Because I didn't want those who

390
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,200
knew little about e-sports to say

391
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,030
playing games was just sapping my spirit.

392
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,310
Of course.

393
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,830
Now we have more or less

394
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,200
improved our understanding,

395
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,590
and reduced our misunderstandings of it.

396
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,480
According to the data,

397
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,920
in the last year,

398
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,030
the World Championships have

399
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,440
reached tens of millions of views.

400
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,750
And this figure

401
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,030
is actually bigger than

402
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,110
that of many traditional athletic projects.

403
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,200
We also know that nowadays

404
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,590
more and more universities,

405
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,440
for example,
Communication University of China,

406
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,550
have now created a major in e-sports

407
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,440
to provide professional talents

408
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,920
for the future e-sports industry.

409
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:14,920
Yes.

410
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,350
So I'm very grateful to my bestie Jinyang

411
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,750
for proposing to hold this carnival.

412
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,960
We hope that

413
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,000
you can understand more about
what e-sports really is,

414
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,680
through getting in touch
with professional players.

415
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,110
We will also try to

416
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
change your views on players,

417
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,510
make Chinese e-sports proud

418
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,590
and let the world see
the power of our Chinese players.

419
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,310
Okay, this male student.

420
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,440
Hello, Mr. Ai Jia.

421
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm a fan of yours.

422
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,110
I heard a lot about you

423
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,440
when I was enrolled.

424
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,000
I want to know

425
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,790
how did you persevere until now

426
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,830
when the people around you
didn't understand e-sports,

427
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,310
or even rejected it?

428
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,110
When you were alone against everyone,

429
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
did you ever think about giving up?

430
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,750
I…

431
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,270
never thought about giving up.

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
But I did

433
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,350
once hurt

434
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,000
my family

435
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,400
because of my love for gaming.

436
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,830
My experience, I guess

437
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,920
is like that of a little bastard.

438
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,440
Disobedient,

439
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,720
wanton, reckless.

440
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,070
Gave up on school.

441
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,030
Ran away from home.

442
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,400
Aren't you going to leave?

443
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,160
Go.

444
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,880
You've grown up anyway.

445
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,750
You're independent now.

446
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,640
You won't listen to anything I say.

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,960
All you do is play games all the time.

448
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,720
Playing games.

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,350
How many times have I told you?

450
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,550
Have you ever listened?

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,640
Tell me,

452
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
what future can you have by playing games?

453
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,200
What can you contribute to society?

454
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,750
This is what I like to do.

455
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,880
I won't give it up.

456
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Mom.

457
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,000
Can't you understand me?

458
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,310
I understand you?

459
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,790
What can I understand about you?

460
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm a teacher.

461
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
I can teach so many children well.

462
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,110
Why can't I teach you well?

463
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,350
Let me ask you one last time.

464
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
Do you still play games?

465
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,480
Yes.

466
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,640
Okay.

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
Get out of here.

468
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,590
After you leave,

469
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,160
don't ever come back.

470
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,750
So,

471
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,200
from the day I made this my career,

472
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,790
I told myself

473
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,590
I would never go home

474
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
without accomplishing something.

475
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,830
I want everyone to know

476
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,920
not everything that
goes against the norm is wrong.

477
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,830
I can be responsible for my own choice.

478
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,880
I'm aware that

479
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,350
many people in real life

480
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,790
don't understand our profession.

481
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,720
They think that the e-sports industry
is just a way to mess around

482
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
and play games.

483
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,480
It's no different from
being in an internet café.

484
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,440
People may just see the rewards
given in live stream,

485
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,510
the craze of fans,

486
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,720
and those millions of annual bonuses.

487
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,440
But I want to ask you,

488
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,550
is this all true?

489
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,110
Like all sports,

490
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
e-sports

491
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,110
is a competition between all the top players.

492
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,030
And the training and pressure resistance

493
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,550
that these top players go through

494
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,880
are definitely not any easier
than athletic sports,

495
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,030
no worse than any of them.

496
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,680
A senior player once said

497
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
our world

498
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,350
is as cruel as the other sports,

499
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,720
because there are so many cases of failure.

500
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,400
Those who have talent
are not necessarily able to play well,

501
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
those who play well can not

502
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,240
necessarily be remembered.

503
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
Those remembered by people

504
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,680
don't necessarily have good results.

505
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,070
So

506
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,350
those professional players
who have achieved success

507
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,750
have put in more effort than others.

508
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,680
Their efforts determine
the ceiling of their success.

509
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,720
Just like all of you,

510
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,680
doing exercises, memorizing words

511
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,030
and preparing for IELTS.

512
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,510
If you fail,

513
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,350
will you regret
playing games in the first place?

514
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,110
Although e-sports is a game,

515
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
the process to its success is not a game.

516
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,960
I tried my best.

517
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,590
Even if I failed, I wouldn't regret it.

518
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,720
Youth is not an excuse to cover up mistakes.

519
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,720
But we do have youth only once.

520
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,240
Once you decide to do it,

521
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,920
you must have the courage to never look back.

522
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Okay, classmates.

523
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,310
This year's championship competition
has already started.

524
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,680
The Final will be held in Shanghai.

525
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,960
This is a great honor.

526
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,920
Please be sure to cheer for your schoolmates

527
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,310
and for Chinese e-sports.

528
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:45,750
Go! Go! Go!

529
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,640
Where's Jinyang?

530
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,550
She's still busy.

531
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,790
Then let's go first.

532
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,270
What's the hurry?

533
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,030
Auntie, you're too kind.

534
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
Hello, Ms. Lin.

535
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,270
When you graduated,

536
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,400
you said you didn't know
what was right for you,

537
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,110
and now you've become so good

538
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,680
within less than a year.

539
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,400
You were even invited back to give a speech.

540
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,640
No.

541
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,920
It's all because of Jinyang and Ai Jia.

542
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,240
Ai Jia.

543
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:31,960
Mom.

544
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,030
I didn't expect you to come.

545
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,680
I was asked to come by Jinyang.

546
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,640
She and I had a long talk

547
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,550
about you,

548
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,110
about e-sports,

549
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,750
about this business of yours.

550
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,400
I didn't think I would come either.

551
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,480
It was Jinyang who convinced me.

552
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,070
In fact, even up until now,

553
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,440
I still don't understand

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,640
e-sports,

555
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,110
or clubs you're talking about.

556
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,640
But there is one thing I do understand.

557
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,640
My son has grown up.

558
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,920
He can also

559
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,790
make the right choice

560
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,920
for his own life.

561

562
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,160
he's growing up.

563
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,350
He will succeed.

564
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
I have a class to teach. I'll leave now.

565
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,160

567
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,720
I haven't been back to school
for a long time either.

568

Why don't I

569
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
walk around with you?

570

Let's have a family dinner

579
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920

580
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,440
Let's talk about that later.

581
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,830
You're that busy?

582
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,400

Explosive news!

591
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,310
There's big news!

592
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,640
- What's wrong?
- Hurry up.

593
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,270
- Have ZGDX's Double Carry players started a relationship?
- What's wrong?

594
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,440
I felt something wrong before.

595
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,440
As a girl,

596
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,400
I think eyes can't deceive.

597
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,960
Let me see.

598
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,070
This.

599
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,920
Mentioning Tong Yao the first time

600
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,070
in the MVP interview,

601
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,790
Lu Sicheng praised her

602
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,720
as a very capable player.

603
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,790
Eyes down with tender expression

604
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,000
and a faint smile on his lips.

605
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,880
The classic motion picture is from
when Tong Yao's shoe was stepped on by Chubby

606
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,440
and she was then lifted up by Lu Sicheng.

607
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,310
It is essential.

608
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,350
Look at this and this.

609
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,350
Look at this.

610
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,830
They were caught by the fans

611
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,790
when they went to the movies
for the first time.

612
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,310
Tong Yao tilted her head
and looked at Lu Sicheng.

613
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,830
Fans quickly found out that they were in love.

614
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,110
It's amazing!

615
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,310
What are you looking at?

616
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,270
The carnival thing is on the hot search?

617
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,400
No, no, no.

618
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,480
I'll show you the photos.

619
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,160

620
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,920
Oh, my God!

621
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,680
This…

622
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,880
How come such a good thing
as the carnival hasn't gotten on the trending topic,

623
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,070
and this has?

624
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,240
When did the Double Carry players
in our team get together?

625
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,480
As our team manager,
I should say no one informed me of that before.

626
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,920
Tong Yao, what's going on?

627
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,110
Why do the people of our team
get to know it later

628
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,070
than the netizens in E-sports Industry Farm?

629
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,070
When did you guys start

630
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,510
sneaking around in love?

631
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Traces can be hidden.

632
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,640
But the way they look at
each other can't fool anyone.

633
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,160
Can't fool anyone.

634
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,960
What look?

635
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,310

definitely together,

639
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,070
or Cheng is unrequitedly in love with Tong Yao.

640

641
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,310
We dare not ask Cheng.

642
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,160
You tell us now.

643
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,680
There are already netizens betting on
getting upside down to eat shit.

644
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,680
Look at this.

645
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,400
What is this?

It's that time of year again

653

has his annual crush on girls.

654
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,750
In past years he hid it well.

655
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,070
This year he probably didn't manage to hide it.

656

What? The photographer must be messing around.

744
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,750
What's he up to?

745
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,000
(But today is special.)

746
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,310
(It's two contestants.)

747
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,110
(I wonder what they will do.)

748
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,640
What are you looking forward to?

749
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,590
Kissing?

750
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,480
Are you stupid?

751
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,510
So stupid.

752
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:27,620
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

753
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,030
What's going on here?

754
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
You didn't report it to the club either.

755
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,030
Mom, look!

756
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,320
(This love means)

757
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,550
Am I being cheated on?

758
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,800
(I don't care about anything.)

759
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,670
Yang.

760
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,480
- You don't have to, Yang.
- Jian Yang.

761
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,550
- All right.
- Don't be angry.

762
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,840
Don't be upset, don't be upset.

763
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,590
(Live Stream)
(Before the start of today's game,)

764
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,590
(we found that the camera has caught)

765
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,000
(ZGDX team's ADC Lu Sicheng)

766
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,320
(and midsolo Tong Yong)

767
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,030
(kissing openly)

768
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,190
(in front of everyone's eyes.)

769
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,400
(They are already in a public relationship.)

770
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,860
(Yao, are you going to play e-sports)
(This scene made everyone present surprised.)

771
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,030
(or act in an idol drama?)
(This scene made everyone present surprised.)

772
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,630
(And CK's jungler Jian Yang
sitting on the game stage)

773
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,760
(was so pissed off
that he dropped his mouse.)

774
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,400
Good for you, my bestie.

775
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,710
If it were me today,

776
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,230
I'm sure I'd brag about it
to my grandchildren.

777
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,070
Back in the day,

778
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
your grandfather and I

779
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,760
kissed

780
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,320
in front of everyone's eyes.

781
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,190
Are you being bombarded?

782
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I guess my parents

783
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,030
will be coming to the base soon.

784
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,320
What did they say?

785
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
What can they say?

786
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,400
My mom is baffled,

787
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,480
asking me if I'm here to play professionally

788
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,920
or to star in an idol drama.

789
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,760
And my roommate of four years in college

790
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
said she wanted to end the friendship with me.

791
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,000
You're the one
who fell in love with the gaming idol,

792
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,110
while playing professionally after all.

793
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
And you didn't inform anyone of it.

794
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,590
Of course, friendships will be at risk.

795
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,710
You're still laughing?

796
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,920
What should I do?

797
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,800
What should you do?

798
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,110
Wait to marry into the rich family,

799
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,960
or

800
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,670
wait for Mrs. Lu to make
an offer of five million yuan,

801
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,880
to get you to leave her son.

802
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,960
I didn't want to announce it either.

803
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,800
I knew I would be judged so harshly.

804
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,230
What if

805
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,030
something goes wrong during the future games?

806
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,230
What if I get beaten up again?

807
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,000
What if Lu Sicheng's fans jump off a building?

808
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,030
Mind your own business.

809
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,110
Why do you worry about others?

810
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,000
It would be fine as long as Cheng loves you.

811
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,760
I love you too.

812
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,590
See, you've got so much love.

813
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,670
I feel like I've been possessed by their words.

814
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,590
I'm starting to wonder

815
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,550
whether e-sports players in a relationship

816
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,760
is a bad influence.

817
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,630
You didn't

818
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,360
just fall in love today.

819
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,070
When you first started to fall in love,

820
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,190
there was no bad influence.

821
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,400
It was fine, right?

822
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,590
What? Are you going to let go

823
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,510
such a good man?

824
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,710
Get out.

825
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,110
Hit it.

826
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,920
You shut up!

827
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Concentrate!

828
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
You're making a lot of noise.

829
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,510
You've been unginged lately, haven't you?

830
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,230
Wake up!

831
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,880
(Mrs. Lu)
I'm so annoyed.

832
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,230
Hello?

833
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I was just playing a game.

834
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,670
I didn't see it.

835
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,480
I said I didn't.

836
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
You're just guessing.

837
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,000
And you blame me for your incorrect guess?

838
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,280
The little girl?

839
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,800
That's right.

840
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,510
That girl is Tong Yao.

841
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,840
Yes, yes, yes.

842
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,800
She looks quite young.

843
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,840
But she is 18 years old and an adult.

844
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,760
It's not illegal.

845
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,760
What was that noise?

846
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,360
I kissed her.

847
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,840
What?

848
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,630
You want to come to Shenzhen?

849
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,480
What are you going to do in Shenzhen?

850
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,800
Don't scare her.

851
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,070
What does her family do?

852
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,440
Can you not act like a

853
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,710
noisy relative?

854
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,150
If you keep being so unreasonable,
I will hang up the phone.

855
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,190
Cheng.

856
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,510
It's mom, right?

857
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,000
Dad saw it too.

858
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,960
He said he couldn't
get through to you on the phone.

859
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,590
Go away!

860
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,550
My brother has been on the phone for so long.

861
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,840
He must be thirsty. So am I.

862
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,710
Hurry up and fill us both a glass of honey water.

863
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
You wish.

864
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,320
I'm your future brother-in-law.

865
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,880
If you don't please me now,

866
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,070
it won't be easy for you
when you marry into our family.

867
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,740
(Real Estate)

868
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,070
Rui.

869
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,360
What are you doing?

870
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,590
Selecting houses for Tong Yao

871
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,510
so that she can move out quickly.

872
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,590
Then you probably won't see
my brother anymore.

873
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,110
Then I'll give her a new security door.

874
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,280
It's useless even to install a hundred doors.

875
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
The little girl will open the door for my brother.

876
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,440
Will she?

877
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:24,760
I see.

878
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,840
What's wrong?

879
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,030
My mother insisted on coming to Shenzhen.

880
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,070
Mrs. Lu?

881
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,100
(Check: five million yuan)

882
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,540
(Payee: Tong Yao Purpose: to leave my son)

883
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,000
Five million yuan.

884
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,400
Leave my son.

885
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,150
Five million yuan.

886
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,280
Leave my son.

887
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,710
(That bitch.)

888
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,510
(Who's she alluding to?)

889
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,360
(Shame on you.)

890
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,230
(Are you playing professionally
or finding a boyfriend?)

891
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,230
(The former poster is so jealous.)

892
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,510
(If ZGDX doesn't win the championship,)

893
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,480
(wait to be judged as a sinner.)

894
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,400
(Is Tong Yao bad?)

895
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,360
(How would she become a sinner?)

896
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,000
(Don't you see who pulled Chessman down?)

897
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,400
(Some damn girls making up
the CP of Chessman and Hierophant.)

898
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,280
(Why don't you accuse them
of distracting Chessman?)

899
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,590
(The "rotten girls" are harmless.
Who have they provoked?)

900
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,440
(Such dirty words.)

901
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,590
(Who first called whom shameless?)

902
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,320
(I am a man.)

903
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,960
(I also think that Cheng has disappointed us.)

904
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,670
(I expected him to win
the national championship trophy.)

905
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,480
(I don't know what he is doing.)

906
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,960
(It's killing me.)

907
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,590
(Is Smiling Su Daji?)
[*Su Daji: Concubine of the last ruler of the Shang.]

908
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,760
(Though she's in a relationship with Lu Sicheng,)

909
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,000
(they've only played one half of the league)

910
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,670
(and didn't lose a single game.)

911
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,360
(Has it already been decided
that they won't win this year's championship?)

912
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,920
(She is like Su Daji,)

913
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,670
(a selfish bitch who thinks of
seducing someone regardless of the team.)

914
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,880
(Disgusting, I want to vomit.)

915
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,480
(And you still want to
play professionally like this?)

916
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,550
(Make a little girl suffer internet violence.)

917
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,510
(Good for you, Tong Daji.)

918
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,510
(Apologize to her now.)

919
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,360
(It's funny.)

920
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,920
(The victim hasn't yet said anything.)

921
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,360
(You guys jumped out
and blamed the victim first.)

922
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,230
(Are you still humans?)

923
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:55,960
Take it easy.

924
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,800
I will first take the initiative

925
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,840
and admit my mistake

926
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,000
as the team manager later.

927
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,400
Then we'll play well with each other.

928
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,280
We'll be fine.

929
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,280
They're coming.

930
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,070
Mr. Li.

931
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,070
Director Wang.

932
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,000
You guys continue the meeting.

933
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,960
It was me who took the initiative to go after her.

934
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,030
I also asked to make it public.

935
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,880
I will bear all the consequences.

936
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:31,840
Well.

937
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,480
I just finished a meeting with the PR department.

938
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,840
We have an emergency PR plan

939
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,110
for this incident.

940
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,480
There's a game coming up.

941
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,230
We promise

942
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
the personal issue

943
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,710
will in no way affect the game later.

944
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,710
Please don't worry, boss.

945
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,440
Director Wang, Mr. Li.

946
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
You guys should come out and explain it.

947
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,000
(I have never seen such an irresponsible club)
Netizens are scolding me on the official blog.

948
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,760
Look!

949
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,630
There are all sorts of curses.

950
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,550
I really can't stand it anymore.

951
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,150
Then get cracking on
issuing an official announcement.

952
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,070
What are you waiting for?

953
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,360
Director Wang.

954
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,510
In your opinion,

955
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,840
is it okay to deal with it this way?

956
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:09,880
Okay.

957
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,320
Let's do it this way.

958
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,590
You guys go out for a while.

959
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,030
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

960
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,320
Come on, Mr. Li.

961
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,360
