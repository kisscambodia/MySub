1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,660
(Three days before the finals)

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,700
(SUP group)

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,560
What can I say?

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,960
We won the finalist.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,640
There should be no problem with the finals.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,510
Actually, this season hasn't been easy for us.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,600
Relegation-avoidance in the Spring Playoffs.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,760
The final championship.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,800
It's like the life of a fictional protagonist.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,830
It's perfect.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,390
With me in the bottom lane,
we can win even with some random shooters.

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,920
Not to mention our shooter
is not just some guy.

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,320
It's the god of shooter.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,420
(AD group)

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,440
It's fine if we looked at each other
from a distance with him staying in South Korea.

16
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,600
He had to come to the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,350
Confront him.

18
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,670
There is no reason not to fight him.

19
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,710
I will make you concede defeat
from the bottom of your heart.

20
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello, I'm Lee Gun-hyeok.

21
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,030
Hello, I'm Lee Gun-hyeok.

22
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,110
For a long time,

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,880
I've been repeatedly asked by others,

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,350
"Who is the world's top shooter?"

25
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,390
Is it you or Chessman?

26
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,470
Such questions

27
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,840
are too disturbing and tiresome.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,920
We should give everyone

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
a chance to see it through.

30
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,560
It's fun to beat him on his turf.

31
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,520
If possible,

32
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,150
I hope that I can hold the trophy

33
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,430
accompanied by your tears of remorse.

34
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,790
Is that what he said?

35
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,870
What's so troubling about

36
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,310
the question of who is the world's top shooter?

37
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,120
Ask me 800 times
and you'll still get the same answer.

38
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,150
It's me.

39
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,230
Little bugger.

40
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,580
(MID group)

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,710
What should I say?

42
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,870
This woman is too arrogant after all.

43
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,680
I will teach her a lesson

44
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,710
so that she'll understand

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,280
e-sports is male-dominated after all.

46
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,400
How dare he say that?

47
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,040
Then I can't wait to see

48
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
how good he really is.

49
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,590
Ai Jia is indeed an excellent player

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,640
in flinching and waiting for team fights.

51
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,280
I hope he won't flinch under the turret
but confront me.

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,430
I'll let him know

53
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,590
what a man said

54
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,480
is like spilled water.

55
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,100
(JUN group)

56
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,310
My jungle is mine.

57
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,000
His jungle is mine too.

58
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,510
Is that really what he said?

59
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,000
No way.

60
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,070
I won't give it to you.

61
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,380
(TOP group)

62
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,430
I'll have a one-on-one fight with him alone.

63
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
Just tell him not to bring his family.

64
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,950
What family?

65
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,640
Everyone knows that
ZGDX's top lane is home to two people.

66
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
I heard that if the jungler
doesn't go there once in a while,

67
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,680
this topsolo may lose his temper
and give him a silent treatment.

68
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,070
Childish.

69
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,310
You want to die, do you?

70
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
Who told you that if K doesn't come,

71
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,590
I'll have a tantrum?

72
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,120
I'll send you a lawyer's letter
if you keep making such a rumor.

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,740
=Falling into Your Smile=

74
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,500
=Episode 31=

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,750
Who told you that if K doesn't come,

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,870
I'll have a tantrum?

77
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,150
I'll send you a lawyer's letter
if you keep making such a rumor.

78
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,000
You're good at telling lies.

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,120
That's right.

80
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,430
I'm talking about you.

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,520
Who are you on the team with?

82
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,750
You're such a little child.

83
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
None of your business.

84
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,470
You're so mean.

85
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,590
Come on.

86
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,870
The BP part is here.

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,030
Everyone, put on the headphones.

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,120
Tong.

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,590
Don't waste time. Hurry up.

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,470
It's starting.

91
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,590
Okay, here I am.

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
Coming, coming, coming.

93
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,520
Hurry up, hurry up!

94
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,310
Hurry up!

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,360
Hello, everyone!

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,120
This is the site of the national finals

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,960
of Onmyoji Arena in 2020.

98
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,750
(I'm Dudou.)

99
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,800
(I'm Chen Yao.)

100
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,870
(Today is destined to be the night of)

101
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,030
YQCB and ZGDX.

102
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,310
In today's finals,

103
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,080
the two sides will fight for supremacy
and be triggered at any moment.

104
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,030
Thanks to BESTORE

105
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,840
for your support of this event.

106
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,430
Let's hold our breath,

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
looking forward to the finals tonight.

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Ban Tamamo-no-Mae first.

109
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,800
I think Tong Yao will choose Tamamo-no-Mae.

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,390
Tamamo-no-Mae was banned again?

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
It seems that

112
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,600
Tong Yao only took Tamamo-no-Mae once
in the opening game

113
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,360
of the season.

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,390
The other time was

115
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,600
with LAN.

116
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,310
You remember it so well.

117
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,510
You haven't forgotten her yet?

118
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a new chapter.

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,390
Tong Yao is quite capable.

120
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,630
If it were me,
I would be afraid of her Tamamo-no-Mae too.

121
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,390
It's safe to ban her. There is no problem.

122
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,720
Menreiki is also banned.

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,310
Does Ai Jia wimp out?

124
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,040
What about the head-on confrontation?

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,390
They can't ban all of the shikigamis.

126
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,240
She's good at a lot more shikigamis than these.

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,390
After banning my Tamamo-no-Mae,
they banned my Menreiki.

128
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,560
I haven't played with Menreiki for so long.

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
Why are they still thinking about it?

130
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,830
Guys.

131
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,600
You didn't do a good job of secrecy.

132
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,830
Cheng.

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Did you get set up by your best friend

134
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,800
in the backstage

135
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,120
and accidentally spill the beans?

136
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,310
How would they know

137
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,510
I was going to take Menreiki today?

138
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,120
How can the team

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,070
who made it to the national finals be stupid?

140
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,040
Besides,

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,870
you didn't take Menreiki for so long.

142
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,750
Everyone knows you've saved it for a big move.

143
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,480
We trapped Hierophant once before.

144
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you think he will still fall for it?

145
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,830
When we walked onto the field today,

146
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,390
he guarded me like a plague.

147
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,480
He could even put a zipper over his mouth.

148
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,870
So you're pretty upset?

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,870
Of course, I am.

150
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm such a nice guy
and he guards me like a thief.

151
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
I'm hurt.

152
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,560
It's time for the national finals.

153
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,270
Can you guys be a bit serious?

154
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,390
Is this the time to

155
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,830
moan on your lost friendships?

156
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,040
Come on.

157
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Let's ban Aobouzu.

158
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,190
Okay.

159
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,480
The other side banned Yamakaze in return.

160
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,950
(It seems that this time)

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
(YQCB is not taking ZGDX lightly anymore.)

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,040
(Tamamo-no-Mae and Menreiki,)

163
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,430
(the two shikigamis Smiling is best at)

164
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,240
(have been banned.)

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,720
(That's right.)

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,950
(But ZGDX is not weak either.)

167
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,190
(They banned Aobouzu.)

168
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,430
(And YQCB banned Yamakaze.)

169
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,270
(It's getting more intense.)

170
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,070
Where are you going?

171
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,870
Ambush them.

172
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,480
I will suddenly jump out
and scare you to death later.

173
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,720
And we'll take some monsters by the way. Nice.

174
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,750
Play tricks as you wish.

175
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,830
You'll know when you become the first blood.

176
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
Let's take small monsters first
and then go to the lane.

177
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
(The finals has just started.)

179
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,240
Pick on us?

180
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,430
Cheng ordered him?

181
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,190
No way. Hit him.

182
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,480
(Umibozu acted on his own)

183
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,750
(or Chessman instructed him to harass?)

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
You've eaten too much, Chubby.

185
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Weak.

186
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,480
Still chasing?

187
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,480
I haven't even touched
the hair of the monster yet.

188
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
That's not worth it.

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
Cheng, come on, I'm going to die.

190
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,560
Why would you come back?

191
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,870
Why don't you just die there and be on-hook?

192
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,510
(After what Umibozu has done,)

193
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,310
(he used both his Flash and Bind.)

194
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
The bottom lane
is forced to embark the hard mode.

195
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,480
Don't goof off.

196
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,480
Let me tell you.

197
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,560
The moment Chubby walked into the river,

198
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
the bottom lane has been a failure

199
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,390
in this game.

200
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,800
K, let's gank in the top lane first.

201
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,870
I will carry this game.

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,510
What?

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,630
Didn't you hear them say

204
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,240
our team's top lane is home to two people?

205
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,720
And you still asked K to help.

206
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
Shame on you.

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
How possibly can you scold others?

208
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,950
Come on.

209
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,070
The other side will reach level 3 in a minute.

210
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,390
According to Hierophant's habit,

211
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,270
he must launch an attack before level 4.

212
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,240
Even if he's conservative,

213
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,870
he will also call the jungler
to help cross the turret.

214
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,310
I'm level 3.

215
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,040
Come and ambush.

216
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,870
Coming, buddy.

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,870
Another fight?

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,360
Be careful not to give away a double kill.

219
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,070
The opponent support doesn't have a Bind or Flash.

220
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
I feel sorry for myself if I don't gank him.

221
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,240
I can feel the greedy eyes of the opponents

222
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,750
sweeping around my body.

223
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,000
Didn't you also try to

224
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,920
get around in the opposing jungle?

225
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
I was trying to lure Hierophant

226
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,950
to come after me with his Flash.

227
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,870
Who knew he wouldn't fall for it?

228
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,310
He's not stupid.

229
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
How can you fool him?

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
The only one who can fool Hierophant in this world

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
is our Cheng.

232
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,240
Be careful, the opposite jungler is coming over.

233
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,120
(Accelerate to chase after Chubby's Umibozu.)

234
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,630
(Third skill plus a set of crazy normal attacks.)

235
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,600
I will control him first.

236
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
I will go into the turret first.

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,480
Don't rush up at first.

238
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm on.

239
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,510
(YQCB is about to do something again.)

240
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,240
(You see?)

241
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,950
(YQCB's bottom laner
is having some cooperative problems.)

242
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,510
(Why is Hierophant carrying
the turret damage now?)

243
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,480
(Hierophant wants to
cross the turret and kill him.)

244
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,430
(Chessman saved Chubby with his Shield)

245
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,720
(and let him escape.)

246
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,680
(After Hierophant entered the turret,)

247
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,030
he has only residual blood now.

248
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,840
He could only escape by Flash.

249
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,790
I told you.

250
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,790
Never do anything rashly.

251
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,910
Hierophant was almost killed there.

252
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
He would have been dead
if my Bind had been ready two seconds earlier.

253
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,080
If your Bind had been refreshed earlier,
he wouldn't have been in such a hurry.

254
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,440
He is a veteran of turret-crossing.

255
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,870
He had calculated the damage and everything.

256
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,270
He just wouldn't die.

257
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,750
Where's our jungler?

258
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,910
Lost in the jungle?

259
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,510
Where's my monster?

260
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,960
The opponent jungler is stealing something.

261
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,790
Tong Yao, come and help me beat him up!

262
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,550
I'm coming!

263
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,000
Go!

264
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,840
(Smiling's skill set)

265
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,750
(controlled Kim Eun-seok.)

266
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,510
(Follow up with a Flash.)

267
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,440
(Output a set of skill damage.)

268
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,080
(First Blood)
(Kim Eun-seok, who doesn't have a Flash, is killed.)

269
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,550
(ZGDX's Smiling and Jungler K)

270
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,910
(worked well together
to get the First Blood. Nice!)

271
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,200
What happened in this game has told us

272
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
never start trouble first.

273
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,480
Those who make trouble will pay a heavy price.

274
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
Why?

275
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,000
The bottom turret is gone.

276
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,080
Tong Yao killed a person.

277
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,750
She hit the turret
more than 10 times ahead of the other side.

278
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,150
The middle and bottom laners
should be winning, right?

279
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,720
That's not necessarily true.

280
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,720
Ai Jia is a player

281
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,910
who is very good at finding opportunities
in the face of pressure.

282
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,960
Fighting against him,

283
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,320
whenever you think you have

284
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
a little advantage and want to launch an attack,

285
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
that'll be bad.

286
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,510
No way.

287
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,030
Look.

288
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,000
(Smiling's skill set has made Ai Jia
residually bloodied.)

289
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,670
(Smiling wanted to use ult
to cross the turret and kill him.)

290
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,360
(But she was hit by the defense turret.)

291
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,550
(Knockup)
(Ai Jia fights back with little blood.)

292
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,000
(He struck Smiling down with the second skill.)

293
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,750
(It doesn't look good for Smiling.)

294
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,360
(Go, go, go!)

295
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
(Smiling tried to retreat.)

296
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,720
(But Kim Eun-seok suddenly
came out from the grass.)

297
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,600
(Freeze)
(Can't get away.)

298
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,670
(Killingspree)
(Smiling was killed in a second.)

299
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,910
As the saying goes,
there are three illusions in life.

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,870
"I have an advantage,
I can carry, I can fight."

301
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,750
Don't be impulsive.

302
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,360
Impulsiveness goes with a price.

303
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,240
Look at him.

304
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,510
He's overtaking you in soldiers.

305
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't say that now, okay? Thank you.

306
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,910
But

307
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,360
when did Ai Jia become so cunning?

308
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,670
He not only ambushed me,

309
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,870
but also asked the jungler to ambush me.

310
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,270
So far in the game,

311
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,240
we can say that Smiling

312
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
is having a hard time.

313
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,510
(She was not only chased by
the opposing midsolo and jungler)

314
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,240
(but also targeted that
she can't even get the soldiers.)

315
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,080
(After five minutes,)

316
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,150
(her gold is only half of
the opponent's midsolo's.)

317
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,750
(Although Chessman)

318
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
(has some small advantages in getting soldiers,)

319
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
(but on the whole, it seems)

320
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,790
(Hierophant is still containing him.)

321
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,390
(There is no way to get out of it.)

322
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,750
(Yes, it's too bad.)

323
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,720
My middle lane is in adversity.

324
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,270
Push the turrets on the top and bottom lanes.

325
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,360
Chubby, go help.

326
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,670
Okay, I'll guard the turret, don't worry.

327
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,960
They're hitting the monster.
Do we want to grab it?

328
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,600
No fighting, no stealing, no team fights.

329
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,550
Develop ourselves.

330
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay.

332
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,080
(YQCB starts hitting the monster.)

333
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
They won't come this time.

334
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,200
You know it again?

335
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,320
Tong Yao will develop herself.
They won't pick up a team fight.

336
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,510
Let's finish the monster

337
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,720
and go straight to the middle lane
and make a forced team fight.

338
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,030
Don't let Tong Yao develop.

339
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,960
Otherwise, I'll be having a hard time.

340
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
Who said before the game

341
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,870
to teach her a lesson?

342
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,000
Not me anyway.

343
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,550
(Killed off monster)/
(We can see that YQCB has finished the monster.)

344
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,360
If we force to have a team fight like this,

345
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,720
it can be a loss for us.

346
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,910
They want to force to have a team fight.

347
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,550
Clear the lane and don't fight.

348
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,750
(Oh my God, Smiling has started a team fight.)

349
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,910
We can't fight!
What are you doing there, Tong Yao?

350
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,960
I've got it under control. We can fight.

351
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,360
(Defeat)
Enemy's shikigami is sealed.

352
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
We can fight. You guys go on.

353
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Fight. Go on.

354
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,380
Kill Chessman!

355
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,910
(God's Envoy)
(Hierophant and Liang Sheng are caught.)

356
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,120
(Chessman's Youko got into the field with an ult,)

357
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,150
(God's Envoy)
(and killed YQCB's bottom lane duo.)

358
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,600
(Defeat)
(Kim's second skill with a Teleport froze 4 people.)

359
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
(God's Envoy)
(Ai Jia took out his ult.)

360
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,540
(- Unstoppable.)
(- Hit the target.)

361
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,240
A collection.

362
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,630
(Unstoppable)
(Only Cat survived on ZGDX's side.)

363
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,080
(Nice!)

364
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,910
(With the premise of)

365
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,270
(losing the bottom lane duo,)

366
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,480
(YQCB has killed four with two.)

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,750
Cat, retreat.

368
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,480
Definitely I should run, I'm the only one left.

369
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,150
(Double Kill)

370
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,270
Nice. Two for four. This is good.

371
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,080
Yes, yes.

372
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,670
Cool.

373
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,240
Cheng, I...

374
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,720
What did I tell you before?

375
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,670
Leave it to me.

376
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,030
Play as you want.

377
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,030
Come on, come on.

378
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm on.

379
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,510
Orochi! Orochi! Orochi!

380
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,870
Let's go, let's grab it!

381
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,750
The other side is fighting Orochi.

382
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
Let's find a chance to grab it.

383
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,600
Okay.

384
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,030
Come on!

385
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm coming!

386
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,320
Go!

387
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm ready.

388
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,790
It's your turn, K.

389
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,630
Go, go, go!

390
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,030
Go!

391
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,960
(On ZGDX's side,)

392
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,670
(K went around the back and followed quietly,)

393
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,510
(while Cat, Smiling, Chubby and Chessman)

394
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,000
(also went after them from the front.)

395
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,720
(Successfully reclaimed)
(YQCB was caught off guard)

396
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,030
(by Chessman)

397
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,720
(who reclaimed Orochi.)

398
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,510
(What's the situation?)

399
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,300
(Defeat)

400
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,440
YQCB is about to get an ultimate chance.

401
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,150
The last battle.

402
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,630
(Guarding the base turret alone.)

403
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,750
(Defense turret requires support)
(ZGDX is coming after with a line.)

404
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,630
(Rong tries to resist.)

405
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,200
(- Defense turret requires support.)
(- Chased by Chessman.)

406
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,670
(Defeat)
(YQCB lost the base turret.)

407
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,440
Chase, go, go.

408
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,790
(Defeat)
(ZGDX has arrived at the YQCB base.)

409
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,790
(Ai Jia is still resisting.)

410
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,500
(Defeat)

411
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,790
(- Double Kill)
(- Taken by Chessman in one fell swoop.)

412
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,870
(YQCB's midsolo Ai Jia has been killed.
Hierophant is left.)

413
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,720
(Can he hold on?)

414
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,910
(As long as the other teammates are revived,)

415
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,480
(there will still be a chance.)

416
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,000
(Double Kill)
Hierophant, be careful!

417
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,320
(Chessman won't give him the chance.)

418
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,200
(Triple Kill)
(Chessman, Triple Kill.)

419
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
(Here we go again.)

420
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,000
- Hit the turret.
- Attack.

421
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,870
(It's like it's invincible.)

422
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,630
(Victory)
ZGDX has destroyed YQCB's base.

423
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,030
(Congratulations to ZGDX for winning the game!)

424
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,790
That's great!

425
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,790
Yao won!

426
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,120
This is the national champion!

427
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,750
Calm down!

428
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,270
My ears...

429
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,550
This is just the beginning, it's too early.

430
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,510
Besides, Yao didn't have a mature mind

431
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,240
in this first game.

432
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,870
Don't be happy too early.

433
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
First set.

434
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,480
♪The so-called rivalry is only
the demon of your own heart.♪

435
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,550
Are you still nervous?

436
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,790
♪Nothing can't be defeated♪

437
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,240
Let's go.

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
♪A monologue that boils at the bottom of the soul♪

439
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,440
♪Burning love explodes in a flash♪

♪The flash has paled♪

441
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,360
The much-anticipated

442
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,150
second match of the national finals of

443
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,870
Onmyoji Arena Pro League

444
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,440
is about to begin.

445
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,550
We would like to thank Opple Lighting
for their special sponsorship.

446
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,440
Opple Lighting lights up your comfortable life

447
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,080
and your championship moment.

448
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,120
But back to the point,

449
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,150
although ZGDX won narrowly in the first game,

450
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,670
in the early stage,

451
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,000
Smiling was clearly suppressed.

452
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
So it depends on what kind of shikigamis

453
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,670
both sides will bring out in this game.

454
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,750
Yes, let's wait and see!

455
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,790
Tong Yao picked Yuri Lowenthal.

456
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,360
Is she going to compete
who is more of a coward with Ai Jia?

457
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,240
I bet 10 yuan it's going to be a disaster.

458
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,870
I'll add 10.

459
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,840
I'll add 20.

460
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,670
Pah.

461
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
These are some shitty words.

462
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,240
(What we should pay attention to
is the midsolo of ZGDX.)

463
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,630
(Smiling chose)

464
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,960
(her less frequently used Yuri Lowenthal.)

465
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,030
I can't believe she chose Yuri Lowenthal.

466
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,510
It seems that this girl
has really grown up a lot.

467
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,910
Good.

468
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,120
You're really good.

469
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,910
You're smarter than me.

470
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,200
Develop myself. Develop myself.

471
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Am I hallucinating? What's that sound?

472
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,360
Are you chanting?

473
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,240
Tong Yao.

474
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,960
What are you chanting about?

475
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,150
Develop herself, don't be rash.

476
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,080
Our Tong Yao is such a fierce player.

477
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,030
Now you tell her to wait and develop.

478
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,510
It's like take a cat can,

479
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,840
put it in front of Biscuit
and tell her not to eat it.

480
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,670
K, come to ambush.

481
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,080
I'll try to see if I can cheat
to get the First Blood.

482
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,600
Here we go.

483
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,030
(Shield Disappeared)
(We can see)

484
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,910
(K is ambushing in the grass again.)

485
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,720
Don't chase,
the opposite jungler should be coming.

486
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,790
We can fight.

487
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,180
(Shield Disappeared)

488
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,910
K, go.

489
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,320
Go!

490
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,320
(Hierophant has fallen for it again.)

491
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,870
(Congratulations to ZGDX for taking first blood!)

492
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,510
Nice!

493
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,870
(Sure enough,
the only one who can trap Hierophant)

494
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,080
(is Chessman.)

495
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,790
Hierophant fell for such a simple trick?

496
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm sure there's an ulterior motive.

497
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,550
I told you.

498
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,790
The only one
who can fool Hierophant is Cheng.

499
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,440
Yes.

500
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,600
I told you that you couldn't fight with
the opposite jungler there.

501
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,320
Are you a fool?

502
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,480
I can.

503
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
No, you cannot.

504
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,360
Trying to fight two people and got killed, right?

505
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,240
Did you hear the sound of your face being slapped?

506
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,200
Why don't you go wilder?

507
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,670
Hierophant succeeded

508
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,870
in driving his support crazy again today.

509
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Compared to your brother,

510
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,150
your brother even looks kind.

511
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,360
(Now we can see)

512
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,960
(ZGDX's K has come to)

513
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
(the grass in the top lane near the river.)

514
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,320
What's going on here?

515
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,120
Ambushing the opponent's topsolo Rong.

516
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,910
They are going to change their tactics.

517
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,150
(But it's as if Rong)

518
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,630
(knows that K is in the grass.)

519
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,360
(He is very cautious.)

520
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,000
(This way, K can't find)

521
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,590
(a suitable opportunity to attack.)

522
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
Chubby, retreat!

523
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,310
(Kim Eun-seok's Onikiri appeared
in the bottom lane.)

524
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,480
(Chessman seems to sense that something is wrong.)

525
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,110
(He wants to evacuate.)

526
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,590
(It's too late.)

527
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,750
(Onikiri went forth with third skill in a flash)

528
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,310
(and kept the full blooded Chessman with ult.)

529
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,400
(YQCB's bottom lane duo,
Hierophant and Liang Sheng)

530
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,750
(Defeat)
(quickly followed and killed Chessman.)

531
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,590
Nice!

532
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,350
Good job, Hierophant.

533
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,160
This is excellent.

534
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,960
I said I can do it.

535
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,790
Look.

536
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,160
They timed it well.

537
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,070
While K was away,

538
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,960
not only did they get to kill
and harvest the jungle

539
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
but also they went down and gank the middle laner.

540
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,110
They are so rich now.

541
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,110
I don't think they can gank the middle laner.

542
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,960
(Defeat)
(The enemy shikigami is sealed.)

543
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
Smiling is too impulsive.

544
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,310
She wanted to kill Ai Jia on her own

545
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,750
but didn't expect she couldn't

546
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,510
(Defeat)
(escape the fate of being set up by Kim Eun-seok.)

547
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,680
(Yes. From this,)

548
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,310
(she's not as calm as player Lv.)

549
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,510
Give me your cell phone.

550
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,350
Give me your cell phone.

551
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,510
Why do you need a cell phone?

552
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,310
How could he say about my daughter like that?

553
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm going to the square and shout for Yao.

554
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,880
Blame on me.

555
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,160
My bad. I didn't hold back again.

556
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,270
If we lose later,

557
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm going to kill myself.

558
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,240
Don't talk nonsense.

559
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,070
Cheng, they are demolishing our second turret.

560
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,440
Cat, Chubby, you guard the turret.

561
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,400
K and I will steal Orochi.

562
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,350
Okay, here we go.

563
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,270
Go steal Orochi at this time?

564
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,400
If...

565
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,070
If they are found out,

566
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,640
captain would be to blame.

567
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,000
It's true love, that's right.

568
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,160
You see, I was right, right?

569
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,790
ZGDX is out of luck in this game.

570
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,110
If it were me, I'd go get Orochi right now.

571
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,880
If we can get Orochi, we can still fight.

572
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,350
Otherwise...

573
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,400
(Come on, Tong Yao!)

574
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,440
Hurry up, Cheng.

575
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,070
Prepare to steal Orochi.

576
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Rong! Rong!

577
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,830
(Chessman and K have started to fight Orochi.)

578
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,160
(If they take Orochi,)

579
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,830
(they might still be able to fight.)

580
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,070
(But YQCB is already coming to Orochi.)

581
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,440
(Orochi has little blood now.)

582
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,590
(The rest of ZGDX's three players)

583
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,440
(are coming to support.)

584
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,400
(Can they take it?)

585
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,030
(YQCB moves in, five against two.)

586
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,830
(Killingspree)
(Chessman and K are surrounded this time.)

587
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,790
(Defeat)
(Yes, it's impossible to escape.)

588
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
(They killed Chessman and K.)

589
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,160
(- Orochi was also snatched.)
- You're not watching?

590
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,270
(- It's a pity.)
- The game is over.

591
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,790
No.

592
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,640
It's too late.

593
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,550
Here it comes.

594
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,480
There is more...

595
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,440
(ZGDX trio is also caught by YQCB.)

596
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,000
Keep watching. Keep watching.

597
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,030
(It's gone. Ace.)

598
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,310
Hierophant.

599
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,590
Nice!

600
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,960
Nice!

601
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,400
(YQCB is pushing the base.)

602
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,000
(The winner is decided.)

603
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,830
YQCB is doing as expected!

604
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,640
That's what the finals are supposed to be like.

605
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,750
YQCB played a great game!

606
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,590
(Congratulations to YQCB
for getting back into the game.)

607
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,750
What's wrong?

608
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,110
You're worried I'll get judged?

609
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,590
Do you remember what I said

610
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,590
when you first came here?

611
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,550
Cheng.

612
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,310
Which time did you mean?

613
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,070
You've criticized me too many times.

614
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,640
I need to orientate the speech.

615
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,070
The time at the supermarket, remember?

616
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,680
In e-sports... being lame is the original sin.

617
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,880
In e-sports... being lame is the original sin.

618
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,270
So we have to win the next game.

619
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,960
Let's go.

620
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Let's go.

621
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,510
The last game, go.

622
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,030
Okay.

623
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,920
I will try to beat you until

624
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,440
you cry with your midsolo.

625
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,750
If you have to say so,

626
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,110
I miss when you lost

627
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,550
and cried with your support.

628
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,000
See you on the field.

629
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,550
Come on, Chessman.

630
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,270
Break a leg.

631
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,750
Light.

632
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,590
Welcome back.

633
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,880
This is the scene of

634
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,960
the finals of Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

635
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,000
The opposing teams are ZGDX and YQCB.

636
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,310
The score on the field is one to one.

637
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,830
The two sides have tied
with each other as expected.

638
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,240
The deciding match

639
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,680
is about to start.

640
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,880
The Battle of Heavenly Mountain.

641
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,270
Well, as we can see now,

642
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,310
all players are already

643
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,160
in front of the computers.

644
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,310
The BP part is coming.

645
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,400
We still ban Tamamo-no-Mae first.

646
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,880
Tamamo-no-Mae must be banned.

647
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,550
Ai Jia, you must ban Tamamo-no-Mae.

648
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay, okay.

649
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
It seems Smiling,
the NO.1 Tamamo-no-Mae in Chinese server

650
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,880
is really something.

651
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,240
Susabi and Menreiki are also banned.

652
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,510
ZGDX actually also banned a midsolo.

653
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,680
Are they all crazy?

654
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,240
What are they thinking?

655
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,070
YQCB

656
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,750
(banned Susabi and Menreiki.)

657
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,920
(Banned Menreiki!)

658
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,920
(- ZGDX…)
(- That's tough.)

659
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,160
(Banned Kiyohime and Higanbana.)

660
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,440
(Okay.)

661
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
(Now they're going to pick shikigamis.)

662
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
(- Let's take a look at what shikigamis…)
- Yang.

663
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
- Yang.
- each team will choose.

664
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,070
The third game is starting,
do you want to watch it?

665
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,790
Cat, is Ibaraki Douji okay?

666
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,440
Yes.

667
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,240
K, choose Kuro Douji for Chubby.

668
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,350
Okay.

669
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,680
Coach, I'll choose Shuten Douji.

670
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,590
All right.

671
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,640
Hierophant, what do you want?

672
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,880
Take Hakurou for me. I want to keep it safe.

673
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,550
Okay.

674
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,640
All right.

675
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,400
Cheng, you can take Chin this time.

676
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,680
Take Mannendake for me.

677
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,880
Okay, we can see

678
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,590
both sides already

679
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,480
have made their choices.

680
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:00,920
That's right.

681
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
YQCB

682
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,880
chose Shuten Douji for topsolo

683
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,160
with powerful outburst of damage.

684
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
The midsolo is Ootengu.

685
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,270
The jungler is Mannendake.

686
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,640
The support is Ichimoku Ren.

687
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,070
The shooter is Hakurou.

688
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,110
Overall, it seems to be a

689
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,550
relatively safe combination.

690
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
That's right. As for ZGDX,

691
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,070
except for Smiling who hasn't yet
been confirmed her final shikigami,

692
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,510
the other four people have all

693
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,880
decided their own shikigamis.

694
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,920
We can see that the topsolo Cat

695
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,440
chose the opposing Shuten Douji's CP,

696
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Ibaraki Douji.

697
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,880
Right.

698
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,310
K, the jungler has taken Yasha.

699
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,830
The shooter Chessman got Chin

700
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,110
while Chubby's support took Kuro Douji.

701
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,110
Let's look at who Smiling will

702
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,270
actually take out today.

703
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,480
Chubby, chose Onikiri for Smiling.

704
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,440
(Onikiri!)

705
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,920
(Oh my god!)

706
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,510
(Smiling has taken Onikiri!)

707
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,160
(Last time when ZGDX)

708
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,510
(played against YQCB,)

709
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,200
(Smiling took exactly Onikiri.)

710
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,680
(That's right.)

711
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,000
If I remember it right,

712
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,160
I think they lost last time.

713
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,750
That's right. I guess Smiling

714
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,440
probably wants to take revenge for this.

715
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Yes, I think YQCB

716
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,830
is thinking the same way.

717
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,240
Look.

718
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,400
All the players don't look so good.

719
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,640
They're probably thinking,

720
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,110
What are you doing?

721
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,310
I've gone through a lot of trouble
to ban three of your shikigamis.

722
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,830
And you're playing a trick on me with Onikiri.

723
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,400
I... I must be playing a fake final.

724
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
Let's wait and see if it's true or not.

725
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,480
Okay, let's go!

726
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,120
- Come on!
- Come on!

727
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,940
- Come on.
- Come on!

728
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,110
Come on, come on, come on!

729
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,060
(Struck Down)

730
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,720
(Smiling's Onikiri
is being contained hard by Ai Jia.)

731
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,680
You can gank Tong Yao here.

732
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,160
Okay, I'm coming to the middle lane.

733
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,000
(Kim Eun-seok has also arrived
in the middle lane,)

734
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
(ready to make a surprise attack.)

735
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,880
(It's quite intense in the middle lane.)

736
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,350
(Smiling is hiding under the turret,)

737
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,160
(too scared to go out contained by Ai Jia.)

738
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,000
(That's right.)

739
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,160
Tong Yao, let me help you this time.

740
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,110
Come on, Cat.

741
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,830
You two must be careful.

742
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,790
Okay, I'll go.

743
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
(And Kim Eun-seok is on.)

744
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,200
(Smiling moved to Ai Jia with her third skill.)

745
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,030
(Smiling was controlled.)

746
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,240
(Cat rushed out in time,)

747
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,640
(- worked with Smiling to kill Ai Jia.)
- Stop.

748
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,550
(Kim Eun-seok tried to die with Smiling,)

749
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,110
(- First Blood.)
(- but got distanced by Smiling with a Flash.)

750
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,400
(- First Blood.)
(- Cat killed Kim Eun-seok in time.)

751
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,110
(- Zero for two.)
(- Nice.)

752
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,110
(Nice.)

753
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,000
Nice.

754
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,750
Cool.

755
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,240
(Ai Jia, Kim Eun-seok failed to gank Smiling)

756
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,720
(but got killed by Cat and Smiling instead.)

757
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,510
Come on, let's kill the monster.

758
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,550
Okay, I'm coming, Cheng.

759
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,270
I'm done ambushing.

760
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,550
(ZGDX is ahead by two heads.)

761
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,750
(We see that they're killing the monster.)

762
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,220
(Reinforcements join the battlefield)

763
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,350
(Okay, the monster has been taken down too.)

764
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,880
If I were the audience,

765
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,240
I'd have gone to the bathroom three times by now.

766
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,680
Do you have a weak kidney?

767
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,070
Young people need to control yourself.

768
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,350
I didn't do anything.

769
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,920
Ask her what she did.

770
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,640
Lu Sicheng.

771
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,440
There are so many people
listening in the backstage.

772
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,790
Can you shut up?

773
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Backstage boss.

774
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,960
This cannot be released.

775
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,640
I don't want to receive any more

776
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,960
dead cockroaches or dead rats again.

777
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,510
And there are many minors in the fans.

778
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,680
What are you laughing at?
The other side is killing Orochi.

779
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,550
Why don't you come and help?

780
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,160
If I die, who will protect you?

781
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm coming.

782
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,680
You complain all day long.

783
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,400
(Come and see this side.)

784
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,000
(- K hid in the grass.)
- This game took a bit long.

785
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
(Seems to be waiting for)

786
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,240
(- the prey to take the bait.)
- I'm worried about my brother's hand.

787
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
(And the whole YQCB is coming to the Orochi pit.)

788
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
(Orochi is destroyed.)

789
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,240
(They're about to take it.)

790
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,790
Why aren't they on it? What are they waiting for?

791
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,750
No hurry.

792
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,680
(How can ZGDX wait till now?)

793
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,070
(Orochi's blood is only a quarter left.)

794
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,000
(If they don't do it now, when will they?)

795
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Almost there, almost there.

796
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,680
Let's wait a little longer.

797
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,240
Ready!

798
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,350
- Go.
- Go, go!

799
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,960
(They're on!)

800
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,000
(Successfully reclaimed)
(K rushed there.)

801
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,720
(Just as YQCB was about to knock out)

802
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,350
(Orochi's last blood,)

803
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,110
(K rushed out from the grass.)

804
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,160
Follow up the victory.

805
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,720
Okay.

806
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,510
The cooked duck is gone.

807
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,830
Looks like Kim Eun-seok is really pissed off.

808
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,160
(ZGDX has done a great job with Orochi.)

809
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,000
Where's Yang?

810
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,960
He's not watching?

811
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,590
In fact, at first

812
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,310
I didn't expect her to play so well.

813
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,110
I kind of have seen her…

814
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,880
There he is.

815
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,350
going from the group match

816
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,880
to shine on the stage now.

817
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,200
I'm also very happy.

818
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,750
I mean it...

819
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,110
Although a year ago,

820
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,680
I would never have thought

821
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,680
she'd come to shake my hand as a rival.

822
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
(If you're really together,
treat us with wedding candies.)

823
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
(Will you never see each other again?)

824
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
(Poor Yang.)

825
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
(It's good for Cheng though.)

826
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,750
It's good for Cheng though?

827
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,440
After all, it's Cheng.

828
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,720
If I were a woman,

829
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,270
I'd like him too.

830
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,110
There is nothing wrong with it.

831
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,070
Really.

832
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,000
Really, really...

833
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,310
Good wishes to them.

834
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Of course, I can get jealous.

835
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,960
After all, the master starves to death
after teaching his disciple.

836
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Now the disciple is striving for the championship

837
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,400
while the master was eliminated.

838
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,350
But I mainly wish them happy.

839
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,200
50 minutes has passed in this game.

840
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,110
It is the legendary bladder game
where people would be so bored to pee.

841
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,480
Let me interview

842
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,160
Lu Sicheng who has a hand injury at this time.

843
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,310
Does your hand hurt?

844
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,030
Not bad.

845
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
It's just that if I lose
after having played for so long,

846
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I will be very unhappy.

847
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,830
I can't hold on.

848
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,750
Even if I think of it's the finals,

849
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,070
even if I think about
the tickets to the World Championships,

850
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,590
even if I think I can travel abroad
at public expense,

851
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,310
I still can't do it.

852
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,510
I'm too tired.

853
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,200
Honestly,

854
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,270
I'm also sleepy.

855
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,640
I've played few games

856
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,790
that last more than 40 minutes

857
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,240
in my career.

858
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,680
It's definitely not strength that
we rely on to win.

859
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,680
It's the will.

860
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

861
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,680
Hang in there for another 10 minutes.

862
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,590
If we lose this game, I'll collapse.

863
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,640
I'll just go ahead in the next fight,
I don't care.

864
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,960
Anyway, a life-or-death struggle.

865
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,720
Come on, Chubby.

866
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,310
Sing a song.

867
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
The battle song starts.

868
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,550
One, two, three.

869
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,790
Come on, goof off.

870
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,680
We've got plenty of time anyway.

871
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,240
What the hell is this?

872
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,510
Come on, love.

873
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,200
There's a lot of foolishness anyway.

874
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,030
Come on, wander.

875
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,830
There's plenty of direction anyway.

876
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,960
Come on, goof off.

877
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,240
We've got a lot of scenery.

878
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,070
I really didn't expect

879
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,720
the battle song of ZGDX that
I've been dreaming of joining in

880
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,240
would be this.

881
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,350
You never thought that one day

882
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,440
you'll use ult and pick up a team fight

883
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,030
while your teammates are singing, right?

884
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,160
What do you think?

885
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,030
Here's our chance. Go!

886
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,680
Go, go, go!

887
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,960
(ZGDX rushed into YQCB's base turret)

888
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,480
(with the line of soldiers)

889
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,590
(and forced to push the turret.)

890
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,070
(Can YQCB hold it?)

891
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,070
(Destroyed)
(It's on! It's on!)

892
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,680
(It's a fierce battle between the two sides.)

893
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,070
Chubby, you protect me, protect me.

894
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,790
It's okay, it's okay. I got your back.

895
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,070
Retreat if you don't feel well!

896
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,750
(Hierophant doesn't seem to have enough blood.)

897
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,550
You kill shooter first.

898
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,790
Cheng, watch your position.

899
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,350
(Destroyed)

900
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,070
(At this time,
Smiling was set on fire by Hierophant)

901
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,680
(and got killed.)

902
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,240
(The enemy sent strong reinforcements)
(At this point I have to praise)

903
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,750
(Hierophant, the world-class shooter)

904
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,160
(for his unique strength.)

905
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,790
Kim Eun-seok and Hierophant
don't have enough blood.

906
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,750
Cheng, harvest them.

907
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,160
Leave it to me.

908
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,640
Kim Eun-seok has little blood too.

909
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,590
(Assist)
(Kim Eun-seok was killed by Chessman.)

910
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,920
(Legendary)
(Chubby didn't withstand it and got killed in a second.)

911
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,240
(- Chessman is still outputting damage.)
- Chubby, you…

912
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,350
(Can he kill Hierophant?)

913
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,460
(Double Kill)

914
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,240
(Legendary)
Hierophant was also killed.

915
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,550
- Nice.
- Yes, yes.

916
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,400
Keep going. Keep going.

917
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,240
No, I don't have enough blood.

918
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,510
Chessman has little blood left.

919
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,640
(Legendary)
(Ai Jia seized the opportunity and killed him.)

920
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,920
Good for YQCB.

921
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,270
Go Smiling!

922
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,920
Cat, retreat, retreat.

923
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,880
Retreat, retreat. Now.

924
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,590
Okay, retreat!

925
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,750
Press forward! Press forward!

926
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,350
- We can push.
- Come on.

927
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,680
Why are there so many minions at base turret?

928
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,440
Ignore them and clear the line first.

929
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,260
(Our defense turret requires support)

930
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,070
K, what are you doing? Clear the line.

931
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,830
I'm clearing, I'm clearing, look at my blood.

932
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,440
Hold on until Tong Yao resurrects.

933
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,830
Hang on, I'll revive in 10 seconds.

934
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,070
(Is this the ultimate fight?)

935
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,750
(Smiling will revive in nine seconds.)

936
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,350
(Let's see if she can save the day.)

937
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm out of blood.

938
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,270
(Defeat)
(Eight seconds.)

939
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,350
(Seven seconds.)

940
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,240
(Six seconds.)

941
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,900
(Defeat)

942
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
(Five seconds.)

943
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,000
(Four seconds.)

944
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,920
(Three seconds.)

945
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,920
(Two seconds.)

946
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,640
(One second.)

947
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
(Tong Yao resurrects.)

948
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,550
Yes!

949
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,310
Go girl!

950
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,270
(Support needed for our junction)
(Smiling rushed forward,)

951
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,310
(went near residually blooded Ootengu
with very fast speed.)

952
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,680
(She used one normal attack with Corrode)

953
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,440
(Double Kill)
(and killed Ai Jia with a skill set.)

954
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,510
Kill! That's it! Kill him!

955
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,790
Come on, Chubby. Back me up. I'll kill them.

956
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm coming, I'm coming.

957
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,110
I'll cover, I'll cover. Go, go.

958
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,110
(Legendary)
(Legendary.)

959
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Triple Kill!

960
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,510
Nice!

961
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,030
Smiling resurrected
at the last minute to get Triple Kill!

962
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,830
Okay, nice!

963
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,920
We have a chance.
Wait for my resurrection.

964
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,830
Cheng, Tong Yao, you can do it.

965
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,790
(Chessman is back from the dead.)

966
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,440
(They're countering fighting now in one breath.)

967
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,270
Tong Yao, follow me up to the base turret.

968
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,720
Okay.

969
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,720
(Chessman and Smiling both rushed to
the opponent's base turret.)

970
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,070
(Golden boy and girl,)

971
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,270
(Diao Chan and Lu Bu,)

972
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
(Huang Rong and Guo Jing in the gaming world.)

973
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Go! Go!

974
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,750
Cheng, Hierophant is coming back to life.

975
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,230
(Hierophant is alive here.)

976
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,110
(Let's see if Hierophant can withstand
the attack of the two)

977
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,280
(for a nice comeback.)

978
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,590
I'll take care of Hierophant.

979
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,590
Tong Yao, you'll go around and push the base.

980
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,030
Okay.

981
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,280
I'll hold off Hierophant.

982
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,110
Right now. Go.

983
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Nice!

984
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,230
(Chessman's revenge battle.)

985
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,480
(A perfect interception.)

986
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,190
(It's a real lightning bolt)

987
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,480
(with Tong Yao.)

988
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,960
(It's really a textbook duel of Light and Shadow.)

989
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,800
Push it, push it.

990
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,280
Tong Yao go! Tong Yao go!

991
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,070
Hold on, hold on, Tong Yao.

992
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,320
Don't worry about it, just push!

993
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,760
Go, Tong Yao!

994
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,230
(In five seconds,)

995
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,880
(YQCB's players are about to resurrect.)

996
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,670
(Let's see if Smiling
can live up to our expectations)

997
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,800
(and take the final victory of the game.)

998
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,070
(There are too many reversals today.)

999
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,880
(It's really hard to predict
the outcome without seeing the end.)

1000
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,110
Tong Yao.

1001
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,960
Come on!

1002
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,800
Resurrected, hold on.

1003
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,960
Go on!

1004
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,840
Nice!

1005
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,550
(Congratulations to ZGDX!)

1006
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,440
- Nice!
(- The regret of the spring playoff)

1007
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,400
(is finally made up tonight!)

1008
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,070
(This is the glory of ZGDX!)

1009
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,590
(Champion Team ZGDX)

1010
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,510
(of Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

1011
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,550
(Let's give the loudest applause)

1012
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,670
(to congratulate ZGDX!)

1013
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,230
ZGDX!

1014
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,480
ZGDX!

1015
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,230
They win!

1016
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,320
Yao wins! Yao is the National Champion!

1017
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,230
Tong, Yao has won!

1018
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,280
Champion?

1019
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,760
- National Champion!
- Yes!

1020
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,480
- Yao wins, Tong!
- Champion!

1021
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,030
- National Champion!
- Yao wins.

1022
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,480
Our daughter is the national champion, Tong.

1023
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,030
Yao's mother, you haven't kissed me in a while.

1024
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,030
One more kiss. One more kiss.

1025
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Don't fantasize.

1026
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,360
Smiling.

1027
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,190
Smiling.

1028
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,360
Smiling.

1029
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,760
Smiling.

1030
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,590
I should tell you Smiling is really capable.

1031
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,670
- That's true.
- Cool, cool.

1032
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,070
- I can't praise Smiling more.
- That's great.

1033
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,920
- Awesome.
- She is really something.

1034
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,360
Smiling is indeed capable.

1035
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,760
I taught her.

1036
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,320
I taught her.

1037
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,280
- I know.
- You taught her.

1038
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,840
- I got goose bumps.
- I taught her.

1039
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,670
- I can't praise Smiling more.

1040
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,590
- Cheers.
- Better than you, better than you.

1041
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,360
- Cool.
- That's really cool.

1042
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,880
We're the champion. We're the champion.

1043
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,150
We won. We're the champions.

1044
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,710
We won, we won, we won!

1045
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,920
I didn't expect to lose in the end.

1046
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,630
Congratulations, Chessman.

1047
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,480
Light.

1048
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,630
Thank you.

1049
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,440
Congratulations!

1050
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,110
I didn't know you were so good.

1051
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,760
You played well, congratulations!

1052
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,360
It's no shame in losing to me.

1053
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,190
ZGDX!

1054
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,960
Ai Jia, I love you!

1055
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,190
ZGDX!

1056
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:58,190
Blow a kiss.

1057
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,920
One, two, three.

1058
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,880
We are the champion!

1059
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,670
- ZGDX, we won!
- We won!

1060
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,210
After ZGDX won the national finals,

1061
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,460
they have started to prepare
for the World Championship.

1062
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,520
As for the ZGDX Double Carry players
that you've been watching,

1063
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,780
I heard that they went to attend

1064
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,140
next-door midsolo's wedding.

1065
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,390
(ZGDX Double Carry players got engaged?)
There is no fake news in E-sports Industry Farm.

1066
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,900
I know you will continue to follow me.

1067
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,930
See you next year.
