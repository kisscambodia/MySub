12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,200
You won't be in the lineups either.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,240
Why are you working so hard?

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,200
I will be in the lineups for certain.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,470
You won't be in the lineups.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,350
No, you won't be in the lineups.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,000
You, come here.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,670
Retard.

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,880
You come here.

Rui, you're finally here.

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,680
- Hello.
- We've waited a long time for you.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,790
Cheng, you came too.

26
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,920
Come on in.

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Come.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,480
- This way.
- Hello.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,000
Too much foundation.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,470
Really?

31
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,560
Let me see.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
It's true.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,710
I won't apply concealer on you.

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,280
I'll just apply some finishing powder
to your face.

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,030
Okay?

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,310
Gosh.

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,190
Cheng, your skin is so smooth.

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,750
I know.

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,280
What's your skincare secret?

40
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,190
I am young.

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,630
I'm already gorgeous.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,710
I don't think I need makeup.

43
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,680
That's not true.

44
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,910
You'll look better with makeup.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,240
Babe, here.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Why are you trimming my eyebrows?

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,360
I have very cool eyebrows.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,080
They are cool, indeed.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
But they are different in height.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,910
Are they?

51
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,680
They are.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,310
Apply a layer of
the Lipstick Color 502 to my lips.

53
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,680
Then apply Lipstick Color 303.

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
This way, I'll look natural and radiant.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,470
Can I skip the eyeliner part?

56
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,910
This looks strange.

57
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,910
Are you sure?

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Rui.

59
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,560
Come and take a look.

60
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,750
Doesn't Cat look more exquisite

61
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,470
after I applied eyeliner to him?

62
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Eyeliner is a must.

63
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,560
Relax.

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,280
I can't draw when you're acting like this.

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,800
Will you please put more contours
on the sides of my face?

66
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,680
My face is large.

67
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,910
Your face is not large, darling.

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,000
Really?

69
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,630
This is the first time I hear someone say so.

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,150
Your face is just fleshy.

71
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,120
K, do my eye lines look exquisite?

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,590
Tong Yao, you still aren't done?

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,190
Women are troublesome.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,590
It's okay.

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,870
Anyway, we'll have
our photos taken separately.

76
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,960
Come on. Let's go to take photos first.

77
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,800
After they finish, you should be done.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,430
It's okay. Take your time.

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,560
Wait, Rui.

80
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,680
Where is my team uniform?

81
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,630
On the couch.

82
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,680
Where is the dressing room?

83
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,080
You can get changed anywhere in this room.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,190
Nobody will look at you anyway.

85
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,630
Are you going to change your clothes now?

86
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,030
If so, I'll go out.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,270
There's no hurry.

88
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
Let's spend a little more time on makeup.

89
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,630
Sure.

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,240
ZGDX is really a star e-sports team.

91
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,680
Check out Cheng's legs.

92
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,270
Chubby.

93
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,630
You should have your photos taken alone.

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
Without anyone standing near you
for comparison,

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
you'll look like a chubby hottie.

96
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,750
Thank you.

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,510
You said the same thing last year.

98
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,160
What time is it?

99
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,750
It's about time to take group photos.

100
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,190
Yeah. What time is it?

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,750
Why hasn't Tong Yao come here?

102
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,630
We've finished the white-themed photo shoot.

103
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,680
Is she having a dramatic makeover?

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,190
Women tend to dally.

105
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,800
Before they go outdoors,

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,720
they wash, comb and blow their hair,

107
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,000
pair up clothing items, apply perfume,

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and pick handbags and shoes.

109
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,830
Yeah.

110
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,390
You are right.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,750
I'll make arrangements.

112
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,950
Cheng,

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,830
could you please go and get her here?

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
You want me to go?

115
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
That's a great arrangement you made.

116
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,040
She is scared of you.

117
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,920
Once you show up,

118
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,630
she'll rush here at top speed.

119
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,040
Hey, Chubby.

120
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
Go on.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,830
Tony,

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,830
do you think I should have more eyeshadow?

123
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,070
No. It's great as it is.

124
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,870
I feel like my eyelashes are falling off.

125
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,560
It's really good.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,000
Rest easy.

127
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,310
Nothing will fall off.

128
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,510
They will rush you
if you stay here any longer.

129
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,510
Alright then.
I'll go get dressed in my team uniform.

130
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,870
Go ahead, get changed.

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,830
Thanks.

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,510
I guess Jinyang is more experienced.

133
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,630
Shorty, the sun is about to set...

134
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,830
Hurry up.

135
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,040
Cheng, what are you doing here?

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,310
The photo shooting crew asked us to hurry up.

137
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,800
What's the matter?

138
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,000
Where is that Shorty?

139
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,070
Go back.

140
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,070
What's wrong?

141
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,800
Is she in there?

142
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,430
Yes.

143
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,000
What's she doing?

144
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,390
I don't know. Just go back.

145
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,430
She'll be with us soon.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,360
Rui insisted that she and I
should have a photo taken together.

147
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,430
So I came.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,070
Okay. Be quick, you guys.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Who were you talking to?

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,000
Lu Yue.

151
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,160
If you're dressed, just come out.
Don't waste any more time.

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,560
So you saw it just now.

153
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm not blind.

154
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,270
The pattern is small.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
I still saw it.

156
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,830
I told you to knock before coming in.

157
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,190
Lu Yue wanted to enter the room too.

158
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,320
I stopped him.

159
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,440
I'm talking about you.

160
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,600
Why bring Lu Yue into this?

161
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,550
You were in there for 1 hour and 40 minutes.

162
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,750
The chances of pushing the door open

163
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,960
to see you dressed like that

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,600
were as slim

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,320
as pushing the door open

166
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,390
to see you dead on the floor.

167
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,630
Nevertheless,

168
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,150
I'll knock on the door the next time.

170
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,360
<i>Lu Sicheng actually apologized to me?</i>

171
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
You're nuts.

172
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,200
Why did you suddenly apologize to me
in all seriousness?

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,870
I thought you needed a serious apology.

174
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,030
I did need it.

175
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,240
In ancient times, you'd have to
marry me in the situation like this.

176
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't push it.

177
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,670
Don't take greater liberties with me.

178
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,390
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,910
You're finally here.

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,510
Tong Yao,

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,910
what happened to your face?

182
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
What do you mean?

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,910
Have you seen a monkey's buttocks?

184
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,120
What did you do in the room?

185
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,720
We ran here.

186
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,030
We were in a hurry.

187
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,270
Why aren't you panting if you ran here?

188
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,030
I have long legs.

189
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,270
Enough chatter.

190
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,000
It's time to get down to business.

191
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Tong Yao, do the photo shoot.

192
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,270
Okay.

193
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,360
It's photo shoot time.

194
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,150
Come on.

195
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,320
Cross your arms.

196
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,720
Lift your chin a little.

197
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,750
Look straight ahead.

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Lower your eyelids.

199
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,840
Okay.

200
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,550
Will my face look big in the photos this way?

201
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,750
Yes.

202
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,120
With my eyelids lowered,

203
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,630
my eyes won't be seen.

204
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,000
But you'll look dominant this way.

205
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,670
Imagine yourself as a queen.

206
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,720
Queen?

207
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
You want this petite girl
to act like a queen?

208
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,550
At least consider

209
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,360
the feasibility.

210
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,390
Lu Yue.

211
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,320
Go there and take photos with her.

212
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,750
I want a feeling of destined battle

213
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,000
and struggle to enshroud you.

214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
There should be signs of intense friction,

215
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
deadly hostility

216
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,600
and silent competition between
a starting player and a substitute.

217
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,630
Create a sense of conflict

218
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,150
that hails from
your competitive relationship.

219
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,600
Move aside. Move aside.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,790
Look over here.

221
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,550
Behave like the retards you were
when you were fighting for a seat.

222
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,080
Rui wants you to stay true to yourselves.

223
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,390
Cheng, go there.

224
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,200
Why?

225
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,600
So you can be photographed.

226
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,240
Why should I be photographed with her alone?

227
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,080
We must have some photos

228
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,720
of ZGDX's most attractive members
standing together.

229
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,390
The club's PR department made this demand.

230
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
Even if you refuse to be photographed with her,
there will be PS photos.

231
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
You may as well have some good photos taken.

232
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,150
Bring a seat here.

233
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,150
Tong Yao, please step down.

234
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,360
You don't have to stand on it.

235
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Cheng, sit down.

236
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,510
This feels like a wedding photo shoot.

237
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,870
It does feel like that.

238
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,910
Look here.

239
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,140
<i>Smiling is really cool!
This team is unmatched in attractiveness.</i>

240
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
<i>Good luck in the new season!</i>

241
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,180
<i>Cheng is truly the team's spiritual leader
and most gorgeous guy.</i>

242
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,500
<i>Gosh! Cheng is so cool!
And Smiling is just as cool!</i>

243
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,780
<i>I wish them all the best in the new season!</i>

244
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,180
<i>The photo is pretty nice,
but only because of Cheng's good looks.</i>

245
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,960
We can take the fight.

246
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,790
Move to high ground.

247
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,910
Wait until I control this one opposite of me.

248
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,240
Take it easy.

249
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,910
We can take this.

250
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,240
- Go.
- Okay.

251
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,320
Cat, come over.

252
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,000
Come here.

253
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,600
Come on.

254
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,630
Yes.

255
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,840
That was easy.

256
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,720
Tong Yao.

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,750
You're lame.

258
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,320
With you staring at me like a vulture here,

259
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
I couldn't play well.

260
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,960
Besides, we won.

261
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,790
Since we won, I'm going to
order something for afternoon tea.

262
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,790
- What do you want to have?
- Alright.

263
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,120
I want that...

264
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,120
What's its name again?

265
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
Don't order food for me.

266
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,550
Jinyang will come to me later.

267
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll dine out with her.

268
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,320
- I'll order a salad for you.
- This, this, this.

269
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,790
- As for you...
- This, this.

270
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,630
I've eaten this before.

271
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,790
What's the matter?

272
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,080
Our official Weibo account manager
posted a sneak peek of our photos.

273
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,510
This photo looks good.

274
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Check this out.

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,750
- Nice.
- You're handsome, Lu Yue.

276
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,960
Look at the back.

277
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,630
<i>My Lv, you finally appeared.</i>

278
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,390
<i>This photo looks nice.</i>

279
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,240
<i>A new generation of
light and shadow is born.</i>

280
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,750
<i>I'm getting more and more excited
about the National League.</i>

281
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,270
<i>Yue&Yao CP fans are on the rise now.</i>

282
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,750
<i>Our Yue is truly young and handsome.</i>

283
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,030
<i>Aren't Smiling and Cheng a couple?</i>

284
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,200
<i>This photo provokes controversy.</i>

285
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,720
<i>Cheng&Yao CP fans, stand firm</i>

286
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
<i>and don't waver.</i>

287
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
I told our official Weibo account manager
to post the photos.

288
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,510
Before the official release,

289
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,550
we're letting those who understand
take a good look.

290
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
Few people understand.

291
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,150
Most people think
this team's only female member

292
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,600
registered her marriage with two men
at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

293
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,750
Most people?

294
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,440
Like who?

295
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
My mother. His mother.

296
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,910
I have five missed calls

297
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,240
and over ten unanswered text messages.

298
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,390
She wants to know if her sons

299
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
have got a girlfriend.

300
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,870
Why were the couple photos posted
on the official Weibo page?

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,150
And why are they dating the same woman?

302
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,000
Hello? Mom?

303
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,150
No, no, no.

304
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,750
it's not what you think
between me and Tong Yao.

305
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,080
Cheng?

306
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't know

307
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,790
if Cheng is...

308
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,750
Thankfully, my parents don't use Weibo.

309
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,440
Tipsy tastes good.

310
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,720
It tastes even better
when I'm looking at your photo.

311
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,720
Nice photo.

312
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,550
Cut it out.

313
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,510
My team forbids romance
between team members.

314
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,080
No romance between team members?

315
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,720
Have you forgotten you were with Cheng alone

316
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,360
or was I blind?

317
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,630
Knock it off.

318
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,720
He just saw me fall off my bed

319
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,080
and come to taunt me.

320
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,720
Now you're putting on an act.

321
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
I'm here to develop
my professional e-sports career.

322
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,120
Nobody said otherwise.

323
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,510
All the comments said otherwise.

324
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,270
Ignore them.

325
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,360
I heard that Cheng and Lu Yue
are biological brothers.

326
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,080
That's quite obvious.

327
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
They look really alike.

328
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
But Cheng is taller.

329
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,030
They are equally handsome.

330
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,390
The moment I saw them,

331
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,200
I had an illusion that the e-sports industry
is filled with handsome young men.

332
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
And?

333
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,440
And I wondered

334
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,240
how I ended up with plain Ai Jia

335
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,870
in an industry filled with
handsome young men.

336
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,360
Ai Jia is handsome too.

337
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,200
Not as handsome as Cheng.

338
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,670
Cheng is a lady killer
in the e-sports industry.

339
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,510
Ai Jia is like a sticking plaster at most.

340
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,750
He clings to me all day.

341
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,910
I can't push him away
no matter how hard I try.

342
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,910
I think you're secretly enjoying this.

343
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
On a side note,

344
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,600
did you really wear the item
with the rabbit and carrot pattern

345
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,670
on the day of the photo shoot?

346
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah.

347
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,550
What? Did it look bad on me?

348
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,030
I think I got something wrong.

349
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,440
What?

350
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,390
I don't know.

351
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,670
Some people like that.

352
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,080
But you must be careful.

353
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,630
Only perverts

354
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,440
would like that.

355
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,550
What the heck?

356
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,240
The internet is heated with
arguments about you and Lu Yue

357
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,750
with some saying you are the starting midsolo
and some saying he is.

358
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,480
Someone even conducted a poll.

359
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
Nice work, my friend.

360
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,000
I didn't know you have so many fans.

361
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm competent and cute.

362
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,070
Of course I have fans.

363
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Unlike Lu Yue, the guy depends on his looks.

364
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,510
Your fans are so professional.

365
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,350
They even made a video

366
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,200
to analyze your strengths and weaknesses.

367
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,550
This is like one of those slideshows

368
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,400
college students
would make for their assignments.

369
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,880
They truly love you.

370
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,960
If they were this enthusiastic

371
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,790
to court Xu Kai, they would have got him.

372
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,310
Let me see.

373
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,030
I want to know about Lu Yue's weaknesses.

374
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,940
<i>She is not bad. And she is more pleasant
to look at than Lu Yue.</i>

375
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,020
<i>Tong Yao's gaming strategy
is conservative and passionless! </i>

376
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,100
<i>She has a ton of weaknesses</i>

377
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,180
<i>and much room for improvement.
She never shows her face in live streams,</i>

378
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,260
<i>but is involved in many romantic scandals
with Lu Sicheng.</i>

379
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,590
What is these people's problem?

380
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,030
My romantic scandal has nothing to do
with my gaming skill.

381
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,270
They must be elementary school students.

382
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,160
You are enviable.

383
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,790
You and the man of their dreams

384
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,030
live under the same roof

385
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,240
and spend every minute together.

386
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,510
I'm green with envy.

387
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,240
You already have a boyfriend.

388
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,830
Watch your mouth.

389
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,510
<i>Have you finished talking?</i>

390
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,110
<i>Ming wants you to come down and train.</i>

391
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,880
<i>Come down now
or we'll go upstairs and grab you.</i>

392
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
<i>No, I'll be down there right away.</i>

393
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,640
<i>Don't do anything rash.</i>

394
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,880
"Rabbit Tightly Holds the Carrot"

395
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,510
told you to not do anything rash.

396
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,750
"Tightly Holds the Carrot".

397
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,830
Be honest with us.

398
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,440
What?

399
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,030
Who is this "Rabbit Tightly Holds the Carrot"

400
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,350
on WeChat?

401
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,440
Are you okay?

402
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,110
Why did you run? That was dangerous.

403
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,350
Are you alright?

404
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,310
Why did you run?

405
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,510
That was dangerous.

406
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,750
If your face got damaged,

407
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,310
it'd cost you a fortune
to get a reconstructive surgery.

408
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,400
Yao, are you okay?

409
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,510
Come here.

410
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,960
Did you get injured?

411
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,640
Does it hurt?

412
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,270
Come on.

413
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,640
Use my phone as you want.

414
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,440
Don't snoop.

415
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,830
You're way too curious.

416
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,310
Are you all right?

417
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,880
Yes.

418
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,510
I'm off then.

419
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,960
Have a good time training.

420
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,590
Won't you go next door
to check on your ex-boyfriend?

421
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,960
He'll pay for being a tsundere.

422
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,310
Let him pay heavily.

423
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm off.

424
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,070
Come out with me.

425
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,350
Give it to me.

426
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
Grab one yourself.

427
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,310
It tastes good.

428
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,830
I'm talking about your phone.

429
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,750
Delete the alias.

430
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,550
What?

431
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Delete the alias.

432
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,640
What alias?

433
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,960
Delete the alias.

434
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,110
I don't understand what you're saying.

435
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,550
Delete the alias.

436
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,920
You mean that alias.

437
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,920
I remember asking someone

438
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,750
to delete a Weibo post

439
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,110
and she said

440
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,480
no.

441
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,440
That happened a long time ago.

442
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,880
How come you still hold a grudge?

443
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,720
Besides,

444
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,550
you locked me out first.

445
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,960
You also hold a grudge till now.

446
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
The alias is too weird.

447
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,000
If other people see my under...

448
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,350
that thing,

449
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,200
and think of the alias you gave me,

450
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,590
what do you suppose they will think?

451
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,200
To whom else are you going to
show you like that?

452
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,680
I'm not going to show it to anyone else.

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,880
You just make me uneasy.

454
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
Why do you feel uneasy?

455
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,510
Don't you think

456
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,030
making your teammate an alias

457
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,680
based on her underwear pattern

458
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,070
is something only a pervert

459
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,750
would do?

460
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,110
A pervert?

461
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,920
I'd never been a pervert to a girl like you.

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,880
Do you think I have no taste?
Or do you think I've lost my mind?

463
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,510
You win.

What kind of rabbit are you?

478
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
If you sit on my face
while I'm sleeping again,

479
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,030
you'll have to sleep outside.

Am I possessed?

484
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,480
Not only did I dream of Lu Sicheng.

485
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,200
but I also thought of him when I saw you.

486
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,270
The National League will start this week.

487
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,550
We'll draw lots to be matched
against our opponents.

488

In order to help you
get in the groove quickly,

489
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,550
we have scheduled a training match

490
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,310
with YQCB.

491
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,440
That relegation team next door?

492
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,920
Why are we fighting them?

493
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,160
Their new shooter has arrived.

494
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,640
I heard that it's big news.

495
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,310
So we need to make ready in advance.

496
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,920
Tong Yao, you'll participate

497
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,440
in the training match.

498
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,270
Love you, Rui.

499
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,030
You're saying it to the wrong person.

500
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,400
Cheng and Ming made the decision.

501
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,790
Why?

502
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,070
You just came back.

503
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,550
You haven't harmonized with everyone yet.

504
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,830
It's better to have Tong Yao
play in today's match.

505
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,830
Then will I be the starting midsolo?

506
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,920
It's hard to say.

507
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,070
We'll get a chart that compares your data
and Lu Yue's data

508
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,070
before the National League.

509
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,720
Whoever stands out
will be the starting midsolo.

510
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
If you lose again this afternoon,

00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,310
the cold chair beside the water dispenser

512
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,200

- Hurry up.

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,400

520
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,960

also has an ID with garbled characters.

522

is somewhat fierce.

Cheng, what's going on?

536
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,200

moved past our tower to kill us.

That's just fierce.

538

554
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,750
you were there
to steal their jungle monsters?

555
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Were you discovered just now?

556
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,030
No way.

557
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,880
I almost pressed myself against you.

558
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,750
I think the other team

559
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,920
suddenly became familiar with your strategy.

560
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,030
Cheng, hang in there.

561
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,830
You guys are making me panic.

562
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,240
Maybe you should let me replace you.

563
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,550
Go away. Stay near the water dispenser.

564
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,550
Chubby, use your ultimate skill.

565
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,270
Understood.

566
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,510
Good job.

567
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,110
Awesome.

568
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,680
Cheng is freaking awesome as always.

569
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:48,830
Cheng, what are you doing?

570
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,550
Hit them.

571
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,480
Cheng, hit them.

572
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,200
Hit them.

573
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,680
Move around.

574
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,160
Youko is mine.

575
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,750
Cheng, where are you going?

576
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,510
Cheng, what are you doing?

577
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,160
Press attack.

578
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,270
Where is our shooter?

579
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,110
Is he lost?

580
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,110
I'm reporting our shooter.

581
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,110
He doesn't work with his teammates.

582
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,440
He deserves fewer points and bad reviews.

583
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,270
I'm in control. Attack. Go after them.

584
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,240
<i>Lion's Lunge</i>
One. Good job.

585
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,420
<i>Defeat</i>

586
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,700
<i>Against One Thousand Troops</i>

587
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,310
Go. Attack.

588
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,860
<i>Legendary</i>

589
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,590
Attack.

590
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,510
- I'm using my ultimate skill.
- Hurry up.

591
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,310
We won.

592
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,640
This is great.

593
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,790
You won again?

594
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,070
We finally won.

595
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,400
That was exhausting.

596
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,350
Who played the other team's Youko?

597
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,750
He was incredibly fierce.

598
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,550
Hierophant is here.

599
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,110
Hierophant?

600
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,830
What do you mean by "Hierophant is here"?

601
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,240
Cheng, don't try to fool me.

602
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,790
He killed me twice

603
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,270
and saw right through

604
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,720
Youko and Doumeki.

605
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,590
Nobody except Hierophant
could do those things.

606
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,550
So, Hierophant was the one who joined YQCB?

607
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,550
What do you mean?

608
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,830
Repeat again?

609
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,400
I think YQCB will announce it soon.

610
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,070
The announcement hasn't been made yet.

611
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,830
How come Cheng was so sure about it?

612
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,310
Does he know Hierophant that well?

613
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,960
Rui said the other day

614
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,310
Cheng and Hierophant

615
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,750
were like light and shadow.

616
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
I know that.

617
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,790
But are they so close?

618
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,440
I smell gossip.

619
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,440
What's the situation?

620
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,160
Is there something going on between them?

621
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Cheng

622
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,310
used to be a substitute
on a foremost South Korean team.

623
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,110
He was the substitute for Hierophant.

624
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,920
They had the exact same

625
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,680
gaming strategy, style

626
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,480
and shikigami lineup.

627
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,440
Some people in and outside China said

628
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,960
Cheng was Hierophant's shadow.

629
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,960
Some other people commented that
he was imitating Hierophant.

630
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,720
You know what he is like.

631
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,590
He is of much pride.

632
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,350
He probably has been unhappy about
that kind of comment for a long time.

633
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,940
<i>Hierophant joined YQCB</i>

634
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,350
YQCB actually made the announcement.

635
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,590
Hierophant joined YQCB.

636
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,000
Many fans left comments.

637
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,400
<i>He is here.</i>

638
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,070
<i>He came for his sweetheart.</i>

639
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,310
<i>Our Gun-hyeok is here</i>

640
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,680
<i>to participate in Onmyoji Arena Pro League.</i>

641
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,720
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

642
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,480
<i>If this is not love...</i>

643
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
<i>It's love. Cheng, do you see?</i>

644
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,070
<i>Your sweety Gun-hyeok is here.</i>

645
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,510
But I'm curious.

646
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,030
Why did Hierophant come to China?

647
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
Can't you see?

648
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,070
He came for Cheng.

649
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,270
Lu Sicheng and Lee Gun-hyeok.

650
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,960
Chessman and Hierophant.

651
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,440
They are like shadow and light.

652
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,630
Rui already told us about it.

653
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,960
It would be an exaggeration
to say Cheng made Hierophant shiver.

654
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,920
But when he was a professional
e-sports player in South Korea,

655
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,510
he had a period of great success

656
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,840
and kept Hierophant in a substitute position

657
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,070
for two whole seasons.

658
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,230
Really?

659
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,920
He was that good?

660
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,880
Of course.

661
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,710
Cheng speaks fluent Korean.

662
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,550
He used to command the team in South Korea.

663
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,070
Later on, he left to be
a professional player in China.

664
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,070
Why would he want to be
a professional player in China?

665
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,190
Because he loves this country.

666
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,960
Cheng wants to lead
the Chinese professional team

667
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,880
in winning the world championship.

668
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,960
So he came back.

669
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,960
That's touching, even for me.

670
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,920
Therefore,

671
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,550
all those rumors
about Hierophant rising again

672
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,480
and Cheng being replaced

673
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,190
and depressed as a substitute

674
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
before coming back to China

675
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,320
are bullshit.

676
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,190
In other words,

677
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,710
Cheng was not driven back.

678
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,110
He wanted to come back.

679
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
What happened after that?

680
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,000
Hierophant felt discontented after that.

681
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,710
Shadow can't eclipse light.

682
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,190
We haven't fought officially.

683
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,280
I haven't beaten you officially.

684
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
How could you just leave like that?

685
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,670
Is everything I own now

686
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
unwanted and granted by you?

687
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,760
That's quite the story.

688
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,190
Because our team

689
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,480
didn't get into the final

690
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,190
for various reasons last year,

691
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,880
they had no chance to compete aboveboard.

692
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,030
So, Hierophant just came to China
in this season.

693
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,670
Is it true?

694
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,000
Of course, it's true.

695
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,480
The most incredible thing about them is that

696
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,230
they can read each other's mind.

697
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,070
Today,

698
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,280
Cheng guessed Hierophant
was on the other team

699
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,000
just because of a match.

700
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,590
What's more, I saw a fanfic about them

701
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,110
in the E-sports Industry Farm group.

702
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I wanted to print it and give it to Cheng.

703
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,230
I wonder how that poker face

704
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,280
will react to the fanfic.

705
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,000
He probably will be so pissed off.

706
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,150
You must be tired of living.

707
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,380
<i>Fanfic about Cheng and Hierophant</i>

708
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,920
K,

709
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,030
what is a fanfic?

710
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,510
Have you watched "18 Bronzemen"?
<i>*"Bronzemen" is pronounced the same as "fanfic".</i>

711
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,360
Yes.

712
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,510
So they were monks once?

713
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,960
Awesome.

714
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,440
Exciting.

715
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,550
Who do you think is better,
Cheng or Hierophant?

716
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,030
Cheng, of course.

717
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,510
Our team's player is always stronger than
any other team's player.

718
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,280
What a diehard fanboy.
