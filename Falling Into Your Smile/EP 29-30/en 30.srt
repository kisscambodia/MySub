1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,390
Next we will play against ZGDX.

2
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,510
I look forward to beating them up again.

3
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,920
To be honest,

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,710
of all the opponents in the semi-finals,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
we are only worried about ZGDX.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,920
ZGDX will not fall in

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,430
the same place twice.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,640
We are the champion.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
I didn't expect

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,670
our team was lucky enough
to make it to the final four.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,560
I think

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,390
Smiling must have prayed for me.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,110
Smiling.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,110
Let's meet in the finals together.

15
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,620
=Falling into Your Smile=

16
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,380
=Episode 30=

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,590
Nice! Come on, Ming.

18
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,710
Come on, Chubby.

19
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,630
Come on.

20
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,080
Cat.

21
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,150
K.

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's go.

23
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,800
Lu Yue.

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,590
Here you are, Tong Yao.

25
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,520
Then Cheng.

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,470
Go for the finals!

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,440
(Congratulate Tong Yao
to get into the annual finals and Cheng.)

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,940
(And by the way I remind you that
this month's KPI is not completed. Rui.)

29
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:35,960
What are you reading?

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,030
The day YQCB won FNC

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
and got the ticket to the national finals,

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
the boss of the next-door team
was standing at the door,

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
holding a pile of red packets.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,750
The team members got out
one by one to receive the red packets

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,080
which seemed to be thick.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,560
- While we…
- While we

37
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,590
didn't.

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,750
Why?

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,560
We too reached the finals.

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,240
Why next-door team can get red packets

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,910
while we only receive candy and greeting cards

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,470
without even a good meal.

43
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,470
I don't feel convinced.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,080
I feel I'm being discriminated against.

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,030
It is rarer to strive for the first
and keep the second place

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,190
now in the final exams,

47
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,710
given you were the second place
in the class in the midterm,

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
or to strive for the first
and keep the second place,

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,910
given you've always
been at the bottom of the class?

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,400
We made it to the national finals.

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,150
It means we have reached
the level of our previous performance.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,710
So what's to reward?

53
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,910
I'll reward you a candy.

54
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,400
Cheng, well,

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
I need to talk to you.

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,710
What's wrong?

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,080
Lu Sicheng, you are cruel.

58
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,590
K, what have you bought here?

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,560
A face mask, MIHOO.
[*Unisonant with "little fool".]

60
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,000
K, what's wrong with you?

61
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,960
Who are you calling "a little fool"?

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,590
We just finished the game.

63
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,280
You two are so close

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
that you call each other name of endearment?

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
Shut up.

66
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,190
This is MIHOO masks I just bought.

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,680
We stay up late every night training.

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,240
My skin is extremely dry.

69
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
This mask is very good at water-replenishing.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,030
I shall replenish water for my skin too.

71
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,840
You've had so much.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,630
Delicious.

73
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,030
Little fool.

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,080
Want to try it?

75
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,240
Does this work?

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,190
Are you calling the mask or me?

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,800
Cat's reflex arc can circle the earth three times.

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
You shut up too.

79
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,270
Guys,

80
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,310
after we finish this game today,

81
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,120
we are going to face the final then.

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,830
But I still want to remind you.

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,160
YQCB is no longer the relegated team it once was.

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,630
He defeated FNC

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
and got into the finals with us.

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Back to the point,

87
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,920
from now on

88
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,360
until the finals starts,

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
our whole base

90
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,270
will be closed for training.

91
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,720
What kind of closed training?

92
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,660
Is the club

93
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,950
going to completely adopt us?

94
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,120
As how closed it is,

95
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,830
we want to guard against the opposite team
as if it's a secret agent.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,560
For example,

97
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,240
no dinner, shopping, chatting in private

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,360
with the rich and beautiful lady next door.

99
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,160
No discussion of tactics
in the name of clipping dolls

100
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,160
with the ex-boyfriend
and current opponent next door.

101
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,750
Of course.

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,160
Biscuit and Scallion also have to be grounded.

103
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,830
They can't interact with
the next-door midsolo's cat.

104
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,510
Wait a minute.

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,920
Can you even draw a map on the back of the cat?

106
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,950
Why don't you just

107
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,630
build a concrete wall,

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,510
the kind that's thick and eavesdropping-proof?

109
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,630
A concrete wall?

110
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,920
It would be better to paste it directly
on the entrance of our midsolo.

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Why?

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,070
If we paste on the entrance of our midsolo,

113
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,680
how can Tong Yao come out?

114
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,870
Rui.

115
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
Our topsolo is somewhat retarded.

116
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,920
Why don't we consider
finding a substitute for him?

117
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,120
No, no, I can do it.

118
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,830
My brother wouldn't let me play midsolo anyway.

119
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
- Seconded.
- Shut up.

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,830
Shut up.

121
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,720
Let's go.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,160
Before we officially go into the closed training,

123
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,950
I'll treat you to something good.

124
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,480
Long live Cheng.

125
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,750
I'm so excited about this.

126
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,120
- Let's go, little fool.
- Let's go.

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
- Let's have a nice meal.
- Don't call me that.

128
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,920
- Let's go.
- Okay.

129
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
- Hurry up.
- Go.

130
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,430
Come on. Have a drink.

131
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,430
Isn't that DQ.Five?

132
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,560
What happened to them?

133
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,680
They don't have their curfew anymore?

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,680
They've been relegated.

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,560
While you were playing in the top 8,

136
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,920
they were still playing for promotion.

137
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,830
No one was paying attention to it.

138
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
So there was no discussion.

139
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,120
They lost their relegation match?

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,560
They got relegated,

141
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,000
and have to play for the seat match?

142
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,630
DQ.Five is no longer in the 12 teams of

143
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,000
next season's Onmyoji Arena Pro League?

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,510
He is Civet Cat.

145
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,560
I know.

146
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,950
He is the captain and support of DQ.Five.

147
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,800
He is an experienced player.

148
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
You guys should behave yourselves.

149
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Don't cause any trouble.

150
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,510
This year,

151
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,510
don't mess around this year

152
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
and play well in the national finals.

153
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,920
When you get the World Championship ticket,

154
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,120
win honor for

155
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,600
our Onmyoji Arena Pro League

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
in front of the world.

157
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,430
Buddies,

158
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't back up you guys like last year.

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,750
I really like playing professionally.

160
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,750
I really like the feeling
of playing alongside my teammates.

161
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,920
Even though there are a lot of pities,

162
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm still very happy.

163
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,510
Now I've come to the end of the road.

164
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,870
But I know

165
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,950
someone will continue to go on for me

166
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,240
and go farther.

167
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,750
I hope you are among the lucky ones.

168
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,510
Come on.

169
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,070
I gotta go.

170
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
I'll go see them off.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Enjoy your drink.

172
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,630
See you later.

173
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,040
Bye-bye.

174
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,750
He just said back up.

175
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
What does that mean?

176
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Before, when our ZGDX

177
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,950
were unexpectedly absent from the national finals,

178
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,630
it was DQ.Five that took our place

179
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,910
in the World Finals.

180
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,870
(Boss, settle the bill.)

181
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,000
I didn't expect that after Hsu Tae-lun left,

182
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,630
they lost their core again.

183
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
They didn't win a single game
in the second half of the National League,

184
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,480
being directly relegated to the seat match

185
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,910
with the bottom ranking in the league.

186
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,910
It can be said that

187
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,630
fans were full of from hope to despair.

188
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,360
How hard it was to endure

189
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,870
the process like boiling a frog in warm water.

190
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,550
Dismissal meal.

191
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,150
The team was disbanded just like this?

192
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,150
It's simply impossible

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,600
for any team

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
that falls into the seat match

195
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,630
to come back with the original lineup.

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,670
After all, the professional league
is a realistic industry.

197
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
After the team is relegated,

198
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
those players who play well

199
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,600
will be hired by other new clubs

200
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,790
and continue to enter

201
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,480
Onmyoji Arena Pro League

202
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
playing for other teams.

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,270
Those players who don't play well

204
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,750
have to find their own chances.

205
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,750
Those teams that fall into the seat match,

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,960
to put it bluntly,

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
are just empty shells.

208
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,550
Yes, they are.

209
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,320
And that kind of dreamlike thing

210
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,150
that five people worked together

211
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,840
to come back to Onmyoji Arena Pro League

212
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,670
from the seat match

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,120
couldn't even be seen in a novel.

214
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,120
So

215
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,150
for the people of DQ.Five,

216
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,390
their team

217
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,390
announced their disbandment on the spot

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,750
the moment they failed to avoid relegation.

219
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,150
Whether they can sit down and play together,

220
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,960
have dinner and chat

221
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,480
like the old days

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
really depends on fate.

223
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,080
So, back to the point,

224
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,870
let's cherish the time we spend together.

225
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,240
That was close.

226
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,150
Our team

227
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,080
once almost had a dismissal meal.

228
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey!

229
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,510
I don't want to have the dismissal meal.

230
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,750
But I can have another bowl of

231
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
your potato and beef curry rice.

232
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,390
- I want to eat it too.
- I want to eat it too.

233
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,030
I want to eat it too.

234
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,080
I want to eat it too.

235
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,750
- I want to eat it too.
- I want to eat it too.

236
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,750
And it's the kind that
hides meat at the bottom of the bowl.

237
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,910
All right.

238
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,270
When we finish the game with YQCB,

239
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,790
I will satisfy your demands.

240
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,120
Now let's toast first.

241
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,630
Come on.

242
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,720
- Come on.
- Cheers!

243
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,480
Clad in thorns and feet in scorching sand.

244
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,240
Never give up.

245
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,840
Cheers!

246
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,670
Cheers!

247
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,750
(Despair.)

248
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,720
(It's like a chronic death)

249
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
(with a death notice.)

250
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,360
(How can I not be desperate?)

251
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
(But now,)

252
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,000
(I can finally get a moment of peace.)

253
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,510
(It's time to take a good rest)

254
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,630
(both for us)

255
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,630
(and for all of you lovely fans.)

256
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,840
(Goodbye.)

257
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,910
(DQ.Five.)

258
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,510
(You had the glory.)

259
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,910
(Where you go, we go.)

260
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,630
(It's not scary to go to the seat match.)

261
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,720
(We are with you.)

262
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,030
(Civet Cat.)

263
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,550
(Will we ever see you again
in the Spring Playoffs)

264
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,910
(with smile, holding the spring trophy?)

265
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,630
(I don't know what to do
after the disappointment.)

266
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,510
(I've never liked a team so much.)

267
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,390
(I'll probably never watch)

268
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,480
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League anymore.)

269
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
(I really feel so tired.)

270
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,790
(Why do I have to like e-sports?)

271
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,030
(In fact, sometimes I always persuade myself)

272
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,270
(to like the South Korean TAT)

273
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,440
(or ZGDX.)

274
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,630
(That's great.)

275
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,630
(They can always win the game.)

276
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,960
(How happy it is to be a fan of theirs.)

277
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,960
(I've said it a million times)

278
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,390
(but still end up coming to watch)

279
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,480
(your games.)

280
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,120
(- Fans are really disappointed.)
(- We feel desperate if you lose)

281
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,480
(and then optimistically)

282
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,960
(hold the thought that
you can win again next time.)

283
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,200
(It's stupid.)

284
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,120
(What can I do?)

285
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,600
(I'm desperate too!)

286
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,670
(I can't break free.)

287
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,790
(I can't escape.)

288
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,790
(I didn't come when you're at the top.)

289
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
(I don't abandon you when you're at the bottom.)

290
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,550
Cheng.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,870
Cheng.

292
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Cheng.

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
Cheng.

294
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,960

When I first met you,

304
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,960
it was the same situation as now.

305
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,150
I could only look at you from afar at that time.

306
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
But now

307
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,750

It's too good.

315

You should eat less.

Everybody, relax.

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
Now that we're in the finals,

it proves that we do have the strength.

319
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,390
Don't be so nervous afterwards.

320
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,600
Since we are here in Shanghai,

321
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,870
I'll give you all an afternoon off

322
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
to have a good time.

323
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,030
To do what?

324
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,720
A day trip to Onmyoji Arena battlefield
is better than

325
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,440
to this popular tourist city
recommended by internet celebrities.

326
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,600
Now that we're here, let's go have fun.

327
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,390
That's right.

328
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,390
If you go back home

329
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,200
and people ask you,

330
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,480
what did you see in Shanghai?

331
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,440
You go like

332
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,480
"staying in the hotel
and playing games are really cool."

333
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,630
How embarrassing!

334
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,440
That's right.

335
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,600
Where do you want to go later?

336
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,240
It's all right.

337
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
I will go wherever you go.

338
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,960
Shopping?

339
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
But there's nothing I want to buy.

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,630
A human cash machine is standing next to you

341
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,600
and you're telling me this?

342
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,150
Do you think I like you for your money?

343
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Do you?

344
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,390
Fine, buddy.

345
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,270
What's wrong with you?

346
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,440
You're so desperate to spend money for me.

347
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,150
If I like a person,

348
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,480
I'd love to spend money on her.

349
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,870
If I have 10 yuan,
I would spend 9.5 yuan on her

350
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,360
and save the remaining 50 cents to buy buns,

351
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,600
because I'm afraid she'll be hungry.

352
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,510
Ew, ew.

353
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,150
I've been your support for two or three years

354
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,360
and let you kill countless times.

355
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,510
I don't ask for much.

356
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,910
Just pay for the new DW watch

357
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,630
in my shopping cart.

358
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,670
Look, look, look.

359
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,200
This one

360
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
shows a good taste and elegance.

361
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
It fits my temperament, right?

362
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,750
No.

363
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,000
Is that all you've got?

364
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,540
(Amao's Mom)

365
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,030
You're not eating?

366
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,030
Then I'll eat them all.

367
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,670
Eat, eat, eat.

368
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,600
Don't be too full.

369
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,720
Chubby, you can really eat so much.

370
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,910
Hey, Jinyang.

371
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,000
We are discussing

372
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,510
about a day trip in Shanghai.

373
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,270
What's up?

374
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,000
Isn't it your birthday today?

375
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,000
How are you going to spend it?

376
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,390
This is the first time that the two of us

377
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,840
can still get together even not in Shenzhen.

378
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,790
I think it's worth remembering.

379
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
What should I send you this year?

380
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,790
A bag, shoes?

381
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,630
A necklace, jewelry?

382
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,080
A wedding dress?

383
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,270
Forget it.

384
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,510
I should let your man give you
the jewelry and wedding dress.

385
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,840
It's not that I'm jealous.

386
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,600
He has more money than I do.

387
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,150
If you say you want to celebrate your birthday,

388
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,600
he can buy the Oriental Pearl Tower

389
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,600
and change its name
into Happy Birthday to My Wife Tower.

390
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
Don't tell him it's my birthday today.

391
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,720
If he really buys something expensive,

392
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,920
I can't pay him back
even if he sells me in pieces by the pound.

393
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,440
Your getting chopped up
are not as valuable as the whole girl.

394
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,830
I also want to have a boyfriend

395
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,070
who can give me something so expensive that I feel

396
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,920
I can't afford even by selling myself.

397
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,160
What's wrong with you today?

398
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,030
Why are you always talking about my birthday?

399
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,830
It's about your dear mother.

400
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,240
She just called me,

401
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,070
telling me that this is your

402
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,590
first birthday alone.

403
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,880
She asked me to spend it with you.

404
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,960
Is she my mother or your mother?

405
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,920
Wouldn't she just tell me about such things?

406
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,030
She's too embarrassed to tell you.

407
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,110
What?

408
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,310
Yang.

409
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,790
Auntie should tell you.

410
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,960
I know that now

411
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,240
young people are
all about romance on their birthdays.

412
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,790
Especially Tong Yao, she has a boyfriend now.

413
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,400
Her boyfriend is quite good.

414
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,310
He's handsome and educated.

415
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,790
So it can work.

416
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,680
It's just that Auntie needs to ask you

417
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,070
to remind Tong Yao

418
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,070
that girls should be more cautious

419
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,270
and pay attention to protection measures.

420
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,440
Let me translate it for you.

421
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,510
Your mother is still young.

422
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,030
She doesn't want to have grandchildren yet.

423
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,920
Okay, okay.

424
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,200
I have to go now.

425
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Why are you so flushed?

426
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,920
My mom complimented you on your good looks.

427
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,160
Shoot.

428
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,400
No way!

429
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,590
Chubby ate it all by himself?

430
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,750
He didn't even leave me
a single crabmeat dumpling?

431
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,590
That's

432
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,200
not enough for Chubby to stuff his teeth.

433
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,750
That's right.

434
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,310
But

435
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,590
Shanghai crabmeat dumplings are really delicious.

436
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,550
Are you okay?

437
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,680
Yes.

438
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,000
You're too full?

439
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
I'll go check it out.

440
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
Are you okay?

441
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,680
Cheng.

442
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,070
I'm not okay.

443
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,620
(The Eighth Hospital of Lanshan University)

444
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
It's been so long.

445
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,680
Doctor, is he okay?

446
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,070
Nothing serious.

447
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,270
Acute gastroenteritis.

448
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,790
He still has a fever.

449
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,030
But you can rest assured.

450
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,200
He's young and in good health.

451
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,200
After the infusion of fluids,

452
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,750
he can be discharged tomorrow.

453
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,350
Thank you.

454
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,030
That's good.

455
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,480
Chubby.

456
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,590
How are you doing?

457
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,030
Much better.

458
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,830
You guys, you guys.

459
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,590
You guys are just trying to screw me.

460
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,240
Whenever there's an important game,

461
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,640
you must

462
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,480
make a mess.

463
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,750
Do you think I live too long?

464
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,480
I have to finish tomorrow's game

465
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,880
even if I'll be lying down.

466
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,030
Good for you.

467
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm hungry.

468
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,240
I want to eat cookies.

469
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,640
Say it again?

470
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,070
I've already thrown up everything I need to.

471
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,310
If it goes on like this,

472
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,030
I'll die of hunger before I get well.

473
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
In the rest of your game,

474
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
you have to finish it with Tong Yao,

475
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,590
the handicapped support.

476
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,750
Aren't you afraid?

477
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,270
I just want to eat cookies, okay?

478
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,680
It's not a crime to eat cookies.

479
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,000
Who will buy me a pack of cookies?

480
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,750
Tong Yao.

481
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,070
Buy me a bag of cookies.

482
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,790
Hurry up.

483
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,750
If I won't get well,

484
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,200
you'll have to work as support for Cheng.

485
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,920
Think about how miserable you were
when you were his support.

486
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,400
What do you want to say?

487
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,160
Why don't we buy Chubby a pack of cookies?

488
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,510
He's so hungry.

489
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,590
I feel bad.

490
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,110
What are you doing?

491
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,200
I didn't take my wallet with me.

492
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,310
And my cell phone is dead too.

493
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,790
I can't buy cookies with a credit card, right?

494
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,640
Wait, he'll be right back.

495
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
How can you be laughing?

496
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,480
Don't be mean to me.

497
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,070
I'll get sore again if you do.

498
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
Hello. How much?

499
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,830
Hello, please wait.

500
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,820

(I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.)

(I'm still in the hospital.)

505
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,200
(How can I have a birthday?)

506
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,270
(Happy birthday.)

How did you know?

When I took your wallet just now,

521

I wanted to see your ugly ID photo.

You…

523
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Luckily I ran fast.

524
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,000
Otherwise, the mall would have been closed.

525
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,110
Happy birthday, e-sports Mulan.

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,200
Have you two had enough?

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,270
We are really a little hungry.

528
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,680
Can we eat the cake now?

529
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,070
Actually, I didn't even plan to
celebrate my birthday.

530
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
The game is around the corner.

531
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,640
It's almost the same
whether I celebrate it or not.

532
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,750
Even if we have to play the game,

533
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,590
you still have to celebrate your birthday.

534
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,200
Yeah.

535
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
Hurry up, hurry up, make a wish.

536
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,160
Yes, come on, make a wish.

537
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,960
Smile necklace.

538
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,510
A necklace for this year.

539
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,310
A diamond ring for next year

540
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,880
with a wedding certificate.

541
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,240
Does it look good?

542
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,750
Yes.

543
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,720
You look good in anything.

544
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,550
So romantic.

545
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,200
Wait, wait, wait.

546
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,030
Shouldn't you pay
more attention to me in my ward?

547
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,830
We can't help it.

548
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,680
The protagonists tonight are destined
to be the Double Carry players.

549
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,720
By the way,

550
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,880
I have gifts for you today.

551
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,240
Normally,

552
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,160
I care about you all the time

553
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,830
as your housekeeper.

554
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,030
I can't fight for you

555
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,160
on the field.

556
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,920
But I can do all the logistical work.

557
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,960
So,

558
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
to ensure that everything goes well next

559
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,350
and all the bad luck

560
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,590
steers away from you,

561
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,480
I specially sent someone to get

562
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,510
this for you,

563
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,440
an amulet

564
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,790
that blesses you in terms of food,

565
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,160
clothing, housing and moods all-round.

566
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,480
Come on, one for each of you.

567
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
Make sure that you'll do a great job

568
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,510
in the finals.

569
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,310
Here you go.

570
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,750
Thank you.

571
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,480
Not bad.

572
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,070
What's that look on your faces?

573
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
Think about it yourselves.

574
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,550
All the way through this league,

575
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,640
you've been injured and sick.

576
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,510
About this,

577
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,590
if you believe in it, then it's true.

578
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,000
If you don't believe it,
you can use it as a talisman,

579
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,750
a souvenir or something.

580
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,920
It doesn't cost you
a piece of flesh with you, right?

581
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,510
By the way,

582
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,240
it's not that the club doesn't have faith in you.

583
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,590
I've made a vow

584
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,030
to take back the trophy of the finals

585
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
and go to the World Championship.

586
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,480
Otherwise, I will

587
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,200
resign.

588
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,590
He can't do that.

589
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,590
Even if he's to be a bus driver,

590
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,440
he has to follow us.

591
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,830
Right?

592
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,480
You're...

593
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,920
But to tell you the truth,

594
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,880
no matter what the outcome this time is,

595
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
I will always support you guys.

596
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,440
No matter what happens,

597
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,830
just betray me, I'll take care of it.

598
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,000
All right, just give me one.

599
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
I also want to make a wish.

600
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,350
I've seen those internet celebrities

601
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,790
say this is quite effective.

602
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,790
Does it really work?

603
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,400
What do you want to wish for?

604
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,310
I'll help you make it happen.

605
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,510
Cheng, I have a wish too.

606
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,920
I also have a wish.

607
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,070
What's the point?

608
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,550
I mean, Double Carry players.

609
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,440
This isn't appropriate, right?

610
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,400
Although I told you to relax,

611
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
you guys don't have to do this, right?

612
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,960
Our primary goal now

613
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,070
is to win the national championship.

614
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,550
Yes, you two have a long way to go.

615
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,200
Please be a little more sincere.

616
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,750
Really.

617
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
I really don't want to be a bus driver.

618
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,880
My wish is

619
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,550
to beat YQCB,

620
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,680
to win the national championship

621
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,350
and go to the world.

622
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,160
That's right.

623
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,640
No more?

624
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,880
To celebrate,

625
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,350
how about we go eat some meat?

626
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,350
- Good idea.
- You still can eat?

627
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,640
Chubby, why don't you behave yourself?

628
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,790
What follows is not just the national finals

629
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,510
but the ultimate showdown
of Light and Shadow.

630
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,270
You should train hard
after you leave the hospital.

631
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,160
If you do a good job,

632
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,270
I'll treat you to crab noodles.

633
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,310
If you don't do well,
you won't even get a cup of tea.

634
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Good for you.

635
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,790
Good cop and bad cop.

636
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,920
You cooperate quite tacitly.

637
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,030
This is called good intention.

638
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,960
Ming.

639
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,270
What did you wish for?

640
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,550
What else could it be?

641
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,440
It must be that we can win YQCB smoothly.

642
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,510
And one more thing,

643
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,880
ZGDX will not disappear from the field.

644
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,480
Bro, why are you bringing up
the same old story again?

645
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,030
Ming, you believe in this too?

646
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,920
Sometimes

647
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,590
we do need some luck.

648
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,350
You have proven yourselves

649
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,440
to be the best professional players
in the world.

650
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,110
Next, just like what Rui said,

651
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,720
we still need a little bit of luck.

652
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,070
As long as we stay together,

653
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,790
all our wishes will definitely come true.

654
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,830
- Yes.
- Yes, come on.

655
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,070
Come on.

656
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,880
Come on.

657
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
ZGDX,

658
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,550
go for it!

659
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,440
Come on!

660
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
Go for it!

661
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,200
This person

662
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,110
likes to hide in here.

663
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,550
So we must be careful

664
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,070
in the fight.

665
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,720
And I practiced these shikigamis

666
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,200
by watching the video of Tong Yao.

667
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,270
Hierophant is back.

668
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,790
Why did Hierophant clip so many dolls today?

669
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,790
Does it

670
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,310
represent the level of tension in his heart?

671
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,830
So many.

672
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,640
Will he give them to the fans in the finals?

673
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,550
Hierophant.

674
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,590
We've just studied

675
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,830
all of ZGDX's national tournaments

676
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,030
and summarized the habits of
their Double Carry players.

677
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,350
Do you want to take a look?

678
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,400
Hierophant.

679
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,480
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong?

680
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,110
He doesn't look good since the fight.

681
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,680
Yeah, he's been sullen.

682
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
Did something happen to him?

683
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,880
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

684
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,350
Liang Sheng.

685
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,790
My palms are sweating.

686
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,000
My heart is beating a little fast.

687
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
What's wrong with me?

688
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,240
You're nervous.

689
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,400
I'm nervous?

690
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,000
It's normal.

691
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,110
Have a Coke

692
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,240
to calm yourself down.

693
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,310
I never get nervous

694
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,000
before I play a game.

695
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,070
Think about it.

696
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,640
The national finals are around the corner.

697
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,680
And

698
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,030
it's also the final match
between you and Lu Sicheng.

699
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,590
I think

700
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,720
you should be nervous.

701
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,160
I'm already 26 years old this year.

702
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,480
So?

703
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,590
So,

704
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,200
before coming to China,

705
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,640
I didn't think of it

706
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,310
as a real battlefield.

707
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
I just wanted to

708
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,830
make the last part of my career

709
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,270
comfortable.

710
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,440
And then what?

711
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,310
I don't know.

712
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,830
Maybe I didn't expect it to be

713
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,310
so hard.

714
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,000
You made me…

715
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,070
What's that saying?

716
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,510
You guys have broadened my horizon.

717
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,240
- Sometimes.
- Broadened his horizon?

718
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,920
He's complimenting us.

719
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,880
I may have made some decisions

720
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,310
only to defeat Chessman.

721
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,720
But you'd still treat me,

722
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,720
you'd still trust me…

723
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,310
Absolutely trust.

724
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,200
That's right.

725
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,030
That's it.

726
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,880
That's for sure.

727
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,200
You're indeed a good player.

728
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,440
That's right, buddy.

729
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,550
So

730
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,270
you guys made me think

731
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,550
we have a chance to go to a bigger stage.

732
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,030
Even though we're only a relegation team,

733
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,350
we've come a long way

734
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,720
to the national finals.

735
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,160
Nothing is impossible.

736
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,310
Yes, it's for the dream.

737
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,200
Buddy,

738
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,590
I want to go with you to the World Championship.

739
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,350
Well.

740
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,070
Let's take the first place in the country.

741
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,640

YQCB.

743
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,720
What a bunch of losers!

744
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,880
What are you guys doing? Come on.

745
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,480
Let's do it again!

746
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,750
Three, two, one.

747
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,350
YQCB.

748
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,960
Stay together to dominate!

749
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,240
- Come on.

750
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,400

00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720

- Go!

752
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,110
Here.

753
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
Have you thought of any other wishes?

754
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,880
Peace of world.

755
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,440
Don't be so corny!

756
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
I wish we could win the championship.

757

759
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,110
but also the world champion.

760
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,110
That's all?

761
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
You're really not going to tell me?

762
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,110
Wishes don't work if you say them.

763
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,790
I don't believe in it.

764
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,640
Other than myself,

765
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,200
who else can control my destiny?

766
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,110
