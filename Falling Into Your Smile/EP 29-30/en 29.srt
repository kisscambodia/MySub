1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,350
YQCB's strategy is different now.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,960
They're making this a drawn-out game.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,480
So, in the team fight during the later stage,

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,590
we must be cautious.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,480
We've fed them intentionally. Leave, guys.

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,080
Let's leave. Tong Yao's losing blood fast.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,670
I can fight.

8
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,320
Let's go, Cheng. Not a good state for a fight.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,120
This thing.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,710
Why didn't you give us a little heads up

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,830
or discuss it with us?

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,430
Is it that you don't want to say

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,750
or that you don't trust us,

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,470
your teammates at all?

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
If you don't need your teammates,

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,430
then I want to make it clear

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,640
that we don't need a leader like you.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,750
Cat.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
ZGDX

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,840
is not a team of myself.

21
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,870
It's our team.

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,640
I admit

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,920
that I need you all.

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,480
That's right.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,510
We're a family, united.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,430
No one can be left behind.

27
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,820
=Falling into Your Smile=

28
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,580
=Episode 29=

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,520
Here.

30
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,500
(Results of the blade event on Smiling)

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,630
That's strange.

32
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,400
Why am I on the trending searches again?

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,870
Out of sight, out of mind.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,470
Take a bite.

35
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,220
(Mother)

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,870
Hello, mom.

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,080
(Yao.)

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,840
(You wouldn't tell us
what happened to you recently)

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,840
(if we don't call you, right?)

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm fine.

41
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,870
He…

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,120
has worked it out.

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,680
(Yao, you are so calm.)

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,310
Calm?

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,750
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
We have been training recently.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,400
(Recall the trending search.)

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,430
We're very busy preparing for the match.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,710
(Still pretending?)

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
(You and your team leader,)

51
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,750
(what's the matter with you two?)

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,430
That…

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,150
(That's enough.)

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,310
(Come home if you have time these days.)

55
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,150
(Take Lu back with you.)

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
(Like I said, he's a good kid.)

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,560
(Handsome and well-educated.)

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,710
(I liked that kid when we first met him.)

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,430
(What are you talking about?)

60
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,710
(Yao, I'm telling you,)

61
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,280
(if you don't come home ASAP,)

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,630
(we'll gank you)

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,470
(in your base.)

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
No. No. No.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,190
We are preparing for a match.

66
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,750
I'll go home on the weekend, ok?

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,030
(Good. Remember to take Lu with you.)

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,360
(We'll make you nice dishes.)

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,630
He's quite busy.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,030
(It's done.)

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,960
I…

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,240
Eh…

73
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,960
My mom asked me

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,120
to go home this weekend.

75
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,160
This weekend?

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,390
You haven't been home for a while.

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
I'll let Rui know.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,510
She also asked me

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
to take you home with me as well.

80
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,920
Ok.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,750
Come on, eat up the rest.

82
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,000
Any more?

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,870
How about canceling it this time?

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,070
I'm too nervous.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,950
I'm not ready yet.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
Next time. You can come next time.

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,360
They…

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,040
Mom.

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,040
Yao.

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,920
- Lu.
- Hello, aunt.

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,600
Yao, why are you just standing there?
Come on in.

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,390
Tong, they're here.

93
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,680
Come on inside.

94
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,950
Don't just stand there. Change your shoes now.

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,070
It's Lu's first time coming here.

96
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,510
Be hospitable to our guest.

97
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,480
Fruits and snacks are on the table.

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Make him feel at home.

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
Dad, I'm home.

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Hello, Uncle Tong.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Hello.

102
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,070
Let's go.

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,480
Dad.

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,070
Did you buy this?

105
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,270
We should have bought a new computer.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Wow, it's Razer's.

107
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,000
Dad, you're a real connoisseur.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,600
What are you looking at?
You're not even listening to me.

109
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,480
Hold on. Wait.

110
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,720
Dad.

111
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,680
Are you watching game live streaming?

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,480
Yeah.

113
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,360
To catch up with your mom.

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,950
Your mom is excellent now.

115
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,630
She's almost half professional.

116
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,240
Dad.

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,070
Did you buy this new computer

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,510
because of me?

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,070
You're overthinking.

120
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,750
There was an old-for-new sales campaign

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
on the Internet.

122
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,310
So, I gave them our old computer

123
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,600
and added some money

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,870
to get a new one.

125
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,830
How is it?

126
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,630
That was cool.

127
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
Can you teach me about it?

128
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,750
I want a 5G mobile phone.

129
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,870
Look. This 5G mobile phone
is different from the previous one, right?

130
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,920
Dad,

131
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,630
why don't you set up the computer
and give it a try?

132
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,560
I was out on the day of delivery.

133
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,680
But I made an appointment.

134
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,190
They'll come another day.

135
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,680
No need for another day.

136
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,800
Cheng, come on.

137
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,800
It's your time to shine.

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
Yao, come and help me wash the vegetables.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,510
Come on.

140
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,070
Uncle, let me help you with the computer.

141
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,510
Mom,

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,630
what do you want me to do?

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
What can you do?

144
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,040
I can't do anything.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Let me ask you.

146
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
You and Lu.

147
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,070
Did you guys fall in love
right from the beginning?

148
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,920
When we visited your base,

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,800
we knew that

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
the way he looked at you

151
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,870
was different from the other boys.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
In what way?

153
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,000
Something like,

154
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,480
"this thing is mine".

155
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,750
Understand?

156
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,070
Thing?

157
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,630
But you didn't have much contact last time.

158
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,190
How do you know?

159
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,630
Of course I know.

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,600
Your mom is experienced.

161
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,120
You can't hide this kind of thing from me.

162
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,800
OK. OK. Mom, enough.

163
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,750
Well. Well.

164
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,920
Enough kidding.

165
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
Come here.

166
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm serious.

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Young people like you,

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
no matter how open-minded you are,

169
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,270
girls still need to look after themselves.

170
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,190
Before any bad things happen,

171
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,240
I'll keep nagging you.

172
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
But if something really does happen,

173
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,310
do tell me.

174
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,160
I won't blame you.

175
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,510
I'll help you.

176
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,870
So, never mess around by yourself, ok?

177
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,080
Promise me.

178
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,320
OK. I promise, mom.

179
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,030
Oh, you're shy.

180
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,720
Go peel the garlic.

181
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Have some tea.

182
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,030
Thank you, Uncle.

183
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,030
Uncle, have a seat.

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,670
It's done. Take a look.

185
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
It's so quickly.

186
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,910
Good.

187
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,750
Good, good.

188
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,120
Is Yao's hand better?

189
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,440
Her hand has healed.

190
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,750
Don't worry, Uncle.

191
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,600
Our Yao seems to be an inattentive girl.

192
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,750
In fact, she is quite sensitive.

193
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,840
She can never tolerate something wrong.

194
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,600
It's either black or white

195
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,550
when it comes to feelings.

196
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,910
Uncle, I know it.

197
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm not against

198
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,600
that you two are together.

199
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,910
But as her father,

200
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,750
I have to confirm with you face to face.

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,030
Are you serious?

202
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Have you seriously thought about your future?

203
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,910
Or is it just a whim?

204
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,550
I know.

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,270
Professional players,

206
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,000
especially those like you,

207
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,150
have many female fans.

208
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,240
If you acquire the kind of indifferent attitude,

209
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,600
I don't agree with you two being together.

210
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's both

211
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,270
be frank.

212
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,240
Do you really like my daughter?

213
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,480
I must ask for a definite answer.

214
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,030
Uncle, don't worry.

215
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,270
I will take her to the end.

216
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,670
After all,

217
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,550
I'll never get to meet

218
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,080
another girl as good as Tong Yao.

219
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,270
Great.

220
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,790
Cheng, what did you say to my dad?

221
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,150
What do you mean?

222
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,750
I heard everything.

223
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,030
What did you hear?

224
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,870
I heard you say that
it's hard to find a girl like me.

225
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,030
And…

226
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,200
And what else?

227
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,670
And…

228
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,360
You said you'll take care of me forever.

229
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,720
What?

230
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
Come closer. I can't hear you clearly.

231
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,910
You said you would…

232
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,150
I will take care of you forever.

233
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,030
Lu Sicheng.

234
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,630
Even if I could find someone

235
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,480
better than you,

236
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,720
I wouldn't go looking for.

237
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
You want to find a better one?

238
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,440
If you dare do that,

239
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,200
I'll get rid of your means
of finding a better one.

240
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,440
You're acting like a boss.

241
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,390
Yeah. Only for you.

242
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,600
Honey,

243
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,030
why don't you go to bed?

244
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,150
Go away.

245
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,150
It's still early.

246
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,510
Go practice your shikigami.

247
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,670
I'm still studying.

248
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,270
By watching the video of
the neighboring shooter?

249
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,550
Stop it.

250
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,960
I want to ask you something serious.

251
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,150
Are you still capable at your age?

252
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,600
Of course.

253
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
Look at you.

254
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,630
What are you thinking about?

255
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,550
What I mean is,

256
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,270
being a professional player at your age,

257
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,550
are your reaction speed and control ability,

258
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,360
any different from

259
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,510
those when you were a teen?

260
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,270
So that's what you were asking.

261
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,790
Differences do exist.

262
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,670
That's why professional players

263
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,510
practice more and more as time progresses.

264
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,440
After all,

265
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,270
I'm not a puppy.

266
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,150
Yes, so I'm planning

267
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,270
to train another group of puppies.

268
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,480
What do you mean?

269
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,510
What's wrong with you?

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Were you up all night?

271
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,120
I was looking up something last night.

272
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Just now, I was waiting for a friend
to get over the jet lag.

273
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,480
And then…

274
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,240
I was inspired by an investor

275
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,030
who just came back to China.

276
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,630
I'm planning to make
an e-sports development plan for the young people.

277
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,670
I'll show you when I'm done.

278
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,750
What?

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,510
I didn't expect that

280
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,840
you were actually serious about

281
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,750
making e-sports into your career.

282
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,150
Of course.

283
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,240
This is good.

284
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,320
I've found that

285
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,790
we've both changed a lot in the past six months.

286
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,030
Yes, indeed.

287
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,870
Just over six months,

288
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,790
and you've made the e-sports star your boyfriend.

289
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,270
Who said

290
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,360
she'd never have a relationship
with an e-sports player?

291
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,870
What a flag!

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
And you have the right to say that to me?

293
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,360
Who said she'd never reconcile
with the e-sports industry?

294
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,390
Now you're slapping yourself in the face!

295
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,910
Ok.

296
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,000
Come here.

297
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,790
Jinyang.

298
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,240
The knock-out match is coming.

299
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,870
We're about to meet CK.

300
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,510
Are you nervous?

301
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
No.

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,550
I just feel that
the past six months are like a dream.

303
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
A year ago,

304
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,870
I was sitting in front of
the computer watching professional games

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,240
and sending bullet comments to make fun of them.

306
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,600
Shortly afterwards,

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,790
I became the one who was made fun of.

308
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,120
Don't worry.

309
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,270
If anybody would send bullet comments

310
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,790
to make fun of you,

311
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,840
that person must be me.

312
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,600
Tell me.

313
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,200
If six months ago,

314
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,390
I had treated Rui,

315
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,670
who invited me to play professionally

316
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,030
as a fraud,

317
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,270
would I still have today's achievement?

318
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

319
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,600
But

320
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,270
it would just be in other ways.

321
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,910
You're bound

322
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,000
to shine in this industry.

323
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,000
Really?

324
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,320
Just like I had fantasized

325
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,910
about countless possibilities.

326
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,120
But, in the end,

327
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,550
I'm still with Ai Jia.

328
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,670
You're right.

329
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,600
Life,

330
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,910
sometimes has countless possibilities,

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,080
but limited assumptions.

332
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,120
You chose your own way.

333
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
No matter if it's gain over loss,

334
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,270
or happiness over torture,

335
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,750
it all has its meaning.

336
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,550
So, what we can do is to just have no regrets.

337
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,670
Wow, philosophical!

338
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Yes.

339
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,670
So, do you regret?

340
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,600
No.

341
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,910
(E-sports Industry Farm)

342
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,200
(CK's victory)

343
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,910
(marked the end)

344
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,390
(finalist competition of the national finals)

345
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,240
(of the 2020 Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

346
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,510
(Now, each team is actively preparing)

347
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,550
(for the coming match.)

348
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,320
(Based on the scores
of the finalist competition,)

349
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,870
(ZGDX, CK, and YQCB)

350
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,150
(are advancing side by side.)

351
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,150
(The tactics and the starting players)

352
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,510
(of the three teams)

353
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,480
(are mutually balanced.)

354
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
(According to our previous
analysis and predictions,)

355
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,270
(the first round)

356
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,590
(will be easy for the three teams.)

357
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,790
(ZGDX can beat LAN easily.)

358
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,310
(Although CK met FNC, the recognized strong team,)

359
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
(in the first round,)

360
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,400
(I bet CK will win considering)

361
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,270
(Yang's performance in this finalist competition.)

362
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,880
(If CK can beat FNC,)

363
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
(then ZGDX will meet)

364
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,750
(their old opponent CK)

365
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,110
(at an earlier time.)

366
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,310
CK,

367
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,400
our old opponent.

368
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
You know their characteristics.

369
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,070
They're just as good as us,

370
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,310
especially Yang.

371
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,510
Since the knock-out match,

372
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,750
his state has been surprisingly good.

373
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,070
So.

374
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,350
Do you have confidence?

375
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,640
Yes!

376
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,160
I'm not sure.

377
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,880

Stop biting your lip.

390
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,480
It's gonna bleed.

391
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,310
Better?

392
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,720
I'd like to borrow some lipstick from you.

393
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,400
Are your legs still weak?

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
Should I hold you up?

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,750
I got your back.

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,720
Let's go.

397
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,440
Hello everyone.

398
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,000
Welcome to

399
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,440
the game site of

400
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,830
the National League of Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

401
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,680
CK vs. ZGDX.

402
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm the commentator, Heng.

403
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,310
Hello,

404
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,880
I'm the handsome commentator, Shuo.

405
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,240
(Now we can see)

406
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,480
(that both teams are ready.)

407
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,070
(Here comes the BP part of this match.)

408
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,680
Ban Lord Arakawa, Tamamo-no-mae

409
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,000
and Shuten Douji.

410
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,960
CK bans

411
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,830
Lord Arakawa,
Tamamo-no-mae and Shuten Douji.

412
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,750
(It seems that
they are afraid of the middle lane.)

413
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,790
(Yes. It seems that
the middle lane is relatively strong.)

414
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,400
Cat.

415
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,200
Let's ban Aobouzu and Satori.

416
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,960
OK.

417
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,550
So does Yamakaze.

418
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,750
(ZGDX bans)

419
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,400
(Aobouzu, Satori, and Yamakaze.)

420
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,510
Get Ubume.

421
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,060
(Ubume)
(Take umbrella as sword.)

422
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,030
(CK got Ubume first.)

423
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,830
Jian Yang took Ubume.

424
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,310
Good. It shows his fear of death.

425
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,070
Did you write this down

426
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
in your girly notebook?

427
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,070
Could you please

428
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,310
forget that for now?

429
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
There are occasions for jealousy, OK?

430
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,750
Tong Yao,

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,160
they unbanned Susabi.

432
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,110
Should we choose it or not?

433
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,200
Susabi against Kiyohime, are you sure?

434
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,550
It seems difficult.

435
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm sure about that,

436
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,590
as long as Susabi's ID is Smiling.

437
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,680
Cheng, that's so proud of yourself.

438
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,510
Tong Yao,

439
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,680
you're pushed to revolt by Cheng.

440
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,920
A Song called "Tough Guys" for you.

441
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,510
Come on.

442
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,750
MC Cat, drop the beat.

443
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,720
Big river flows east.

444
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,270
All the stars follow the Big Dipper.

445
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,510
Follow the Big Dipper.

446
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,750
Everybody, follow me.

447
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,400
Roar when we see injustice.

448
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,440
Do it when it's time to do it.

449
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,000
With no fear…

450
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,030
Want to be in the game quotes again?

451
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,440
What a boring man!

452
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,030
Cheng and Chubby,

453
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,590
choose Hannya and Yasha

454
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,830
for Cat and K.

455
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,830
- OK.
(- Hannya is the topsolo and Yasha is the jungler.)

456
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,000
(Susabi is the midsolo.)

457
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,960
(The ADCs are )

458
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,750
(Youko and Ichimoku Ren.)

459
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,480
(As for CK,)

460
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,160
(Ibaraki Douji is the topsolo,)

461
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,550
(Ubume is the jungler,)

462
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,920
(Kiyohime is the midsolo.
Chin is the shooter.)

463
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,960
(Kuro Douji is the support.)

464
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Come on. Come on. Come on.

465
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,830
Come on, everybody.

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,790
Come on.

467
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Ming, slow down

468
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,440
or you might fall down later.

469
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,510
(Yang is at the top lane.)

470
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,680
Top laner, be careful. The jungler is coming.

471
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,110
Then why don't you come protect me?

472
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,030
What about roaring when we see injustice?

473
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,310
But there's no injustice.

474
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,640
Ok, I'm here, too.

475
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,310
Do it when it's time to do it.

476
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,680
Let's make a co-movement
among the top, mid, and the jungler.

477
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,030
OK.

478
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,750
(K is the one who cares the most about Cat.)

479
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,070
You can't escape, friends.

480
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,350
(ZGDX's three-lane co-movement…)

481
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,720
- Let's retreat now.
(- Starts to attack Yang and Good Luck.)

482
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,620
- I'll go.
- Get back.

483
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,040
I'll go.

484
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,790
(Yang and Good Luck are dying…)

485
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,260
(- Escaped in Flash.)
- The top jungler used Flash.

486
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,750
You can go.

487
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,920
Well done. That was fast.

488
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,310
It's a universal rule that
we don't kill those who used Flash.

489
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,270
OK. He missed the minions.

490
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,000
That's a huge loss.

491
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
No Flash.

492
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,830
No worries about Yang's gank for now.

493
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,830
Cheng can slay the Butterfly as he pleases.

494
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,680
Good.

495
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,200
This makes me feel comfortable.

496
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,880
Focus on the game. Stop your dirty words.

497
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,350
I was talking as usual.

498
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,510
You should blame your hooligan face.

499
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,440
When talking, you look like a hooligan.

500
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,640
When not talking,

501
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
you are premeditating it.

502
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,680
I'm at level six. I'm at level six now.

503
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,510
OK, I'll teleport to the bottom lane.

504
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,000
Kiyohime is at level six. Be careful.

505
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,640
(Hua is at level six.)

506
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,920
(Teleported to the bottom lane to support them.)

507
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,310
Go. Go. Go. Chubby, follow me.

508
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,310
Go. Go. Go.

509
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,160
Help me defend just a little.

510
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,590
Yang is also here.

511
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,070
(Four vs. two. Chessman and Chubby are in danger.)

512
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,830
(First Blood)
(Chubby helped Chessman block the damage.)

513
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,160
(He died immediately.
But at least they saved Chessman.)

514
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,700
YES!

515
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,920
- Good job.
- That was close.

516
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,310
Hua's teleport was decisive.

517
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,270
Not a big deal.

518
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,070
Our midsolo is still alive at the top lane.

519
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,960
Chubby, nice consciousness.

520
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,960
It's OK, Chubby.

521
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,510
We still love you.

522
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,750
(Now, let's see the top lane.)

523
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,070
(Smiling came.)

524
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,840
(Defeat)
(She moved past he tower to kill.)

525
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm dead.

526
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,160
(This revenge is worthy.)

527
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,200
Great. We're even.

528
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,680
Support for topsolo.

529
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,790
You didn't lose anything.

530
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,640
But my poor mid minions are gone.

531
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,030
It's so miserable for me.

532
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,200
Their midsolo is missing from the map.

533
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Be careful about the bushes.

534
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:40,920
So is their ADC.

535
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,270
I'll push forward with the mid minions.

536
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,310
Cat. Go.

537
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,240
Go.
(Look what I found?)

538
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,310
(The remaining four members of CK are at the top lane.)

539
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,780
(Defeat)

540
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,640
(Cat didn't notice at all)

541
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,790
(and got killed at once.)

542
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,600
Nice!

543
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,510
Nice! Nice!

544
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,440
I'm handsome so they singled me out.

545
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,720
I'm afraid you have
some misunderstandings about yourself.

546
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,510
It was obvious, but he still got caught.

547
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,000
As expected,

548
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,440
Cat's reactions slow down as his age grows.

549
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,590
I was not talking about you.

550
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,160
Let me have a look.

551
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,920
The score is 4-2 now.

552
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,790
We are two points ahead,

553
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,640
but our gold is less than that of CK.

554
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,590
What a big loss!

555
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,030
It would be great if we can slay the Orochi now.

556
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,030
Come here. Let's ambush by the Orochi.

557
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,750
I'm coming, Cheng.

558
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,790
Cat.

559
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,830
Just use your ultimate skill.

560
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,590
- OK.
(- CK is losing the Orochi.)

561
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,960
(Watch out! Watch out!)

562
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,830
(Yang can't use any skills.)

563
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,880
(Rampage)
(Yang. Yang.)

564
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
(Yang was slayed.)

565
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,830
(Now, it all depends on Wang.)

566
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,270
(Wang was slayed.)

567
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,350
(Defeat)
(So was Hua.)

568
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,750
(What an excellent game!)

569
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,880
(Yes. That was amazing.)

570
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,880
The Orochi. The Orochi.

571
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,700
(Double kill)

572
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,110
(Successfully sealed)
(ZGDX took the Orochi!)

573
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,750
Good job.

574
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,440
(Yang and Good Luck are dying and have returned.)

575
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,240
That was the so called

576
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,510
teamwork of a first-class team.

577
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,920
Both CK's middle lane's tactic

578
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
and ZGDX's ambush

579
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,400
were amazing. It's really amazing.

580
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,640
- We can pick up a team fight.
- Well done, K.

581
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,400
Team fight! Team fight!

582
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,240
(Successfully sealed)
Go! Go! Go!

583
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,880
- Go! Go! Go!
- (ZGDX is pushing ahead at the middle lane.)

584
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,070
(CK seems to have no chance at winning.)

585
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,030
(It seems they are going to end the game.)

586
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
(Victory)
(Victory!)

587
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,440
(Congratulations to ZGDX for winning this match.)

588
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,960
Yes. Yes. Yes.

589
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,030
OK, I got it.

590
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,640
I'm playing the game.

591
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,880
OK, call you later.

592
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Cheng, what a coincidence!

593
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,030
Last time, you were also having a lollipop here.

594
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,640
Yes.

595
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,830
Last time, you were quarreling with my girlfriend.

596
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,160
If so,

597
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,590
when we meet in game,

598
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,200
I will not show any mercy to you.

599
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,110
OK. See you in game.

600
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,110
I was thinking

601
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,550
where did this cool girl come from?

602
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,480
Unexpectedly, she became my teammate.

603
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Moreover, she became my…

604
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,030
I just knew that
she was going to be a professional player.

605
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
I was too shocked.

606
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,480
We haven't contacted each other
for a while since we broke up.

607
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,400
I never expected that
she would be a professional player.

608
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,480
I never really thought about

609
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,480
breaking up with her then.

610
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,590
So, thanks for fighting with her,

611
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
or else I wouldn't have had a chance.

612
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,160
Good luck in the next match.

613
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,070
I lost once in the Spring Playoffs,

614
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,590
but I don't plan to lose to you a second time.

615
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,160
By the way,

616
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,830
don't tell her I eat candies,

617
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,000
since this does not match with my character.

618
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,440
I knew you still keep her as a WeChat friend.

619
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,680
Lu Sicheng, did you eat candy secretly?

620
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,550
No. Don't wrong me.

621
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,640
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

622
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,880
- You did.
- I did not.

623
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,270
- You did.
- I did not.

624
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,880
Open your mouth.

625
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,680
Let me smell it.

626
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,270
Your mouth smells like strawberry.

627
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,550
- I smelt it.
- No. No. No.

628
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,350
This match,

629
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,790
we'll focus on the co-movement
between the midsolo and the jungler.

630
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,400
When the top fights,

631
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,510
the midsolo and the jungler

632
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,750
must offer support in time

633
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,310
as we're forming a power play situation.

634
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,110
According to my tactic,

635
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,960
we'll rock ZGDX.

636
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,860
- OK.
- Come on.

637
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,480
Come on!

638
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,680
One. Two. Three.

639
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,750
Come on!

640
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,750
Let's go.

641
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,640
Hua,

642
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,720
you need to be careful.

643
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,550
Tong Yao may choose

644
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,240
Tamamo-no-mae to teach you how to behave.

645
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,790
Enough of Tamamo-no-mae.

646
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,000
My head aches when I hear it.

647
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,830
Next round, I'll ban it.

648
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Yang, what will you pick?

649
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,110
Ubume.

650
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,270
What should we ban?

651
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,720
Ban Youko.

652
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,030
- Youko.
- Ok, Youko is banned.

653
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,880
Yes.

654
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Youko was banned.

655
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,310
Which one should Cheng pick?

656
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,750
Pick the frog.

657
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,310
Why the frog?

658
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,590
Or what?

659
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,640
Doumeki, Chin or Komatsumaru?

660
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,440
Kubinashi.

661
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,400
A Liar is not qualified to play these shikigamis.

662
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,680
When did I lie?

663
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,590
You said you quit candy.

664
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,160
I didn't eat any candies just now.

665
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,070
Your mouth smells like strawberries.

666
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,960
It's too obvious.

667
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,240
When you went to the bathroom,

668
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,790
which beautiful lady gave you the candy?

669
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,880
You'd better tell the truth.

670
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,960
I don't have diabetes.

671
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,240
Why are you so strict to me?

672
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,680
Mr. sound engineer,

673
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,640
please don't put these into the game quotes.

674
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,110
Ok?

675
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,790
Why?

676
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,960
I'm afraid about you, the new king of the team,

677
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,350
will receive the blade again.

678
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,750
So sweet?

679
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,680
Of course.

680
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,750
K, choose Shuten Douji for Cat.

681
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,510
OK.

682
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,070
I'll take Onikiri.

683
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,510
Sure?

684
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,640
(Onikiri)

685
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
Cheng, they picked Onikiri.

686
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,720
They dare to pick Onikiri.

687
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,960
Isn't Good Luck

688
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,310
good at controlling tank-type shikigamis?

689
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,480
Why did he pick Onikiri to scare me?

690
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,310
Lu Yue can choose Menreiki.

691
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,590
What's wrong with Onikiri?

692
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,310
Every time we laugh at Lu Yue,

693
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,030
Ming is the happiest one.

694
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,440
Suddenly I feel sorry for him.

695
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,880
I bet ten hamburgers

696
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,960
that Lu Yue is rubbing the wall.

697
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,880
Chubby, you need to get Kuro Douji.

698
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,680
OK.

699
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,790
(OK. They've decided their heroes.)

700
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,590
(The game starts now.)

701
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,270
K, focus on the top lane.

702
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,310
I feel like Good Luck must play Onikiri

703
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,510
on purpose.

704
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,590
OK.

705
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,400
Come on.

706
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,110
Slaying this frail Onikiri

707
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,640
is a piece of cake.

708
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,270
Come on. Go.

709
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,440
- I'm coming.
(- K's at the top lane.)

710
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,750
(It's on. Two vs. one.)

711
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,030
(They can catch him this time.)

712
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,830
Wanna go?

713
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,720
(Good Luck rushed to the turret)

714
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
(Knockup)
(and has gained controlled of Cat.)

715
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
(First blood)

716
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,830
(- Congratulations to CK for winning the first blood.)
- You lost again.

717
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,400
(They've turned the table!)

718
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,400
Mouse problem.

719
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,960
- Yes.
- Who can stop me?

720
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,400
Look at me.

721
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,240
(Good Luck is in the bushes ready to return home for restoration.)

722
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,590
(Knockup)
(K seems to have noticed that)

723
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,310
(Killingspree)
(and is ready to slay Good Luck.)

724
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,240
(The table was turned again.)

725
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,350
(They slayed two and have lost zero.)

726
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,240
(Yes.)

727
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,900
(Rampage)

728
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,700
(Shield disappeared)

729
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,340
(Legendary)

730
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,020
(Defeat)

731
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,000
(Defeat)
(Yang. Yang. Yang.)

732
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,400
(Defeat)
(Aced.)

733
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,160
(I have to say)

734
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,830
(Good Luck's Onikiri has been invincible)

735
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,550
(Double kill)
(ever since it showed up.)

736
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,640
(Yes.)

737
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,590
(ZGDX can't resist their attack at all.)

738
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,440
(The gold gap is wider and wider.)

739
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,160
It's OK. Keep going. We haven't lost this game.

740
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,310
You…

741
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,680
You made the top laner a king.

742
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,440
Cat. K. Clear the top lane,

743
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,350
and get down.

744
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,400
OK.

745
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,310
Tong Yao, get ready.

746
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
I'll come when I clear the lane.

747
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,070
Chubby. Let's push forward

748
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,000
and take the Orochi.

749
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,920
OK.

750
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,720
- GO. Go. Go.
- I'll protect you.

751
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,310
- GO. Go. Go.
- They're fighting at the Orochi pit.

752
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,830
Attack Onikiri. Attack Onikiri.

753
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,550
(We see ZGDX firing at Onikiri.)

754
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,310
(ZGDX all fires at Onikiri.)

755
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,400
(Defeat)
(But they got killed instead.)

756
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,340
(Shield disappeared)

757
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,270
(Double kill. Nice.)

758
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,000
(It seems that they have no chance.)

759
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,590
(Triple kill. Amazing!)

760
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,590
(Amazing!)

761
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,900
(Killingspree)
(Shield Disappeared)

762
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,030
To the core! To the core!

763
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,750
- Fire. Fire. Fire.
- Go. Go. Go.

764
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,960
(CK's winning is assured.)

765
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,240
(CK has pushed to ZGDX's base.)

766
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,590
(Victory)
Victory!

767
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,750
(Congratulations to CK for winning this match!)

768
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,070
(Congratulations to CK!)

769
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
♪I can't be figured out now♪

770
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,270

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,270
Yes. Yes. Well done.

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,680

♪Just because you exist♪

778
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,240
I don't understand their Onikiri's damage.

779
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,400
Enough. Stop thinking about it.

780
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,590
It feels unreal.

781
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,160
Cheng, what are you thinking?

782
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm thinking

783
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,960
if I hadn't bluffed Jian Yang

784
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,440
we might haven't lost this round.

785
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,640
I need to remind you

786
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,000
that we are one to one now.

787
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,160
We haven't lost yet.

788
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,790
But what did you say to him?

789
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,350
When did you meet Jian Yang?

790
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,750
When we were resting earlier

791
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,350
at the exit passage next to the bathroom.

792
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,350
And you said you didn't eat candy.

793
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,880
From now on you are not allowed
to go to the bathroom

794
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,350
unless you are approved.

795
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:24,800
Report?

796
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,400
Report.

797
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,160
What?

798
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,030
Urgent urination.

799
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,590
Good Luck's Onikiri pissed me off.

800
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,480
You can't go.

801
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
Let's go over the last match.

802
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,920
Cat.

803
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,790
You said Shuten would be invincible
if it got strong.

804
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,640
Nonsense.

805
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,550
Did you see Onikiri?

806
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:39,830
I…

807
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,440
Look at Good Luck's Onikiri.

808
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Why can't you use it?

809
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,640
Why?

810
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,030
Tong Yao, please let him go to the bathroom.

811
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,550
Set this crazy man free.

812
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
Didn't you want to go to the bathroom?

813
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Let me check

814
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
if you hide any candy.

815
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,750
Hands on the wall.

816
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,310
Open your legs.

817
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,880
Anything else in your shoes?

818
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,880
How about coming with me

819
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,590
so that you can supervise me.

820
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
What a hooligan.

821
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,320
What are you looking at?

822
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,960
Just now, I didn't dare to speak aloud.

823
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,070
When we lost before,

824
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,150
Cheng always had a poker face.

825
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,800
Anyone who spoke lacked self-reflection

826
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,920
and would be reproved.

827
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,110
You don't need to be afraid this time.

828
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,550
He's in a good mood

829
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,630
as if CK

830
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,960
had remitted 1 million yuan
to his account for a fake match.

831
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,150
Thanks to you.

832
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Yes.

833
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,440
(This is the game site of)

834
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,360
(2020 National League
of the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

835
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,630
(Now we are at the third match)

836
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,150
(between CK and ZGDX.)

837
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,880
(The ban pick part is over.)

838
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,760
(We're about to start the game.)

839
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,360
(Both midsolos are fighting against the line.)

840
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,150
(Susabi)

841
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,960
(may be suffering)

842
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,230
(at the beginning when confronting Tamamo-no-mae.)

843
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,230
(But if Smiling)

844
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,760
(can get some advantages in gaining scores,)

845
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,590
(then Susabi)

846
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,440
(Water carp power)
(will take control easily.)

847
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,760
(Yang is in the upper jungle.)

848
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,030
(Let's look at ZGDX.)

849
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,030
(K will reach level four
after killing this Kirin.)

850
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,880
(Then, no matter whether he goes to
the middle or the bottom lane…)

851
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,480
K, how long do you need for the jungle?

852
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,630
Come to the bottom lane.

853
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,110
I feel like Jian Yang's coming.

854
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,280
OK.

855
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,590
(K finished the jungle and is waiting
in the bushes at the bottom lane.)

856
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,360
Chubby, go ahead.

857
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,230
- I'm coming.
(- It seems that the bottom lane is quit bustling)

858
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,110
(- Yes. Yang's Yasha has been drained.)
- Chubby.

859
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,440
- Fire.
(- K shows up.)

860
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,480
K, take him down. Don't let him escape.

861
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,190
(K attacks by the way.)

862
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,670
(First blood)
(Yang is slayed.)

863
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,590
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

864
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,150
Get back. Get back. Get back.

865
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,070
Nice.

866
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,500
(Knockup)

867
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,110
(Smiling used a set of skills and Corrode)

868
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,480
(Killingspree)
(when Hua was using his ult)

869
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,550
(and knocked him down.)

870
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,440
This situation,

871
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,150
I guess,

872
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,400
is a relief to

873
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,590
fans no matter whether they are at the site

874
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,840
or on live streaming channel.

875
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,670
She hasn't taken part in the match for a while,

876
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,030
but that hasn't affected her state at all.

877
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,960
Wang, come with me.

878
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,190
Go to the middle lane first.

879
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,510
If we don't catch them, it'll be hard to fight.

880
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,280
(Each attacker scored one point.)

881
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,000
They took up the whole Vision.

882
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,920
Chubby. K.

883
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,150
Try to get some for us.

884
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,710
OK.

885
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,880
Quiet.

886
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,510
Let me finish collecting the gold and experience.

887
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,590
They're afraid of being caught.

888
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,480
Or let K focus at the top

889
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,400
and not go to the middle lane.

890
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,320
Yang is unwilling to catch you anyway.

891
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,630
Chubby, you're brave now.

892
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,230
Be careful, in case Cheng slays you, too.

893
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,110
You talk a lot.

894
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,480
Why don't you go take up the Vision.

895
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,280
No.

896
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm poor. I need to go to the jungle.

897
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,840
You are so mean
when we're in a favorable position.

898
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,590
Then what about being in an unfavorable one?

899
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,920
You said Yang wouldn't come to the middle lane.

900
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,550
I think he…

901
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,230
Yang has cleared the minions.

902
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,630
Why are you laughing?

903
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,550
Your scream.

904
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,480
The audience heard it.

905
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,590
No way.

906
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,960
(In ZGDX's zone, there burst out)

907
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,590
(a lady's scream)

908
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,480
(which could shake the heaven and earth.)

909
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,550
(No wonder they said ZGDX has a new king. )

910
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,230
(Yes.)

911
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,710
Ok. Let's attack the Orochi.

912
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,360
Ok.

913
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,190
Cat and K, wait at the top of the Orochi pit.

914
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,230
Tong Yao, on the left.

915
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,880
Chubby come with me at the middle.

916
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,880
OK.

917
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,360
Go. Go. Go.
(ZGDX starts to attack the Orochi.)

918
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,190
They are starting to attack the Orochi.

919
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,030
Don't rush. They can't finish in a short time.

920
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,150
Assemble first.

921
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,480
- On the way.
- OK.

922
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,960
Yang assembles the team.

923
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,440
Watch out. They are coming.

924
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,150
Keep attacking? My Subdue is not ready.

925
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,360
It's such a loss if they get it.

926
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,670
Let's go. Let's go.

927
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,920
Save your skills.

928
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,150
Let's wait in the bushes.

929
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,920
We'll wait for them.

930
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,840
- OK
(- The attacking is a little hasty.)

931
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,590
(No.)

932
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,590
(They didn't return)

933
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,230
(but wait in the jungle.)

934
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,840
(But if they fight in this area,)

935
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
(CK'll be at a disadvantage position.)

936
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,230
(The fight is on.)

937
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,150
(Yang is buried.)

938
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,460
I think I was buried! Butterfly.

939
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
(Shield disappeared)
I'm firing. I'm firing.

940
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,840
(Shield disappeared)

941
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,400
(Defeat)
(Smiling controls Wang.)

942
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,670
I was cut out. Where are you, Wang?

943
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,710
I'm being controlled.

944
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,670
(Legendary)
(Instakilled.)

945
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,280
(Legendary)

946
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,230
Hua, you're up. Go.

947
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,320
Chubby, use your ultimate skill.

948
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,110
Coming.

949
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,070
(God's envoy)
(Butterfly is in danger.)

950
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,630
(Perfect Power)
(Double kill.)

951
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,110
Surprise, friends.

952
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,880
(Legendary God's envoy)
(Good Luck has been slain.)

953
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
(They're depending on Hua.)

954
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,230
(Let's see if Hua can escape.)

955
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,030
Cover us.

956
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,040
(Double kill)
(Hua.)

957
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,800
(Hua has been slain, too.)

958
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,190
Yang, go away. Don't get caught.

959
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,000
(Killingspree)
(That was an excellent cooperation.)

960
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,230
Stop chasing. The middle lane still has minions.

961
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,150
Push. One take.

962
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,000
Ok.

963
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,110
One take. One take. Go. Go. Go.

964
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,150
(Now, we can see that)

965
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,030
(ZGDX is at the base.)

966
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,710
(CK only has Yang.)

967
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,030
(It seems the game's ending.)

968
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,000
(Destroy)

969
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,800
(Yang can not turn the table alone.)

970
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,030
(But Yang has come up.)

971
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,720
(He wants to give it a try.)

972
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,230
Go. Go. Go.

973
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,550
Attack the base. Ignore him.

974
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,880
- OK
(- Aim at the base.)

975
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
The base. The base. The base. Come on.

976
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,590
(Knockup)
(Almost. Almost. Hurry up.)

977
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,000
(Victory! Congratulations to ZGDX)

978
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,840
(for becoming the national top four.)

979
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,710
(Congratulations to ZGDX.)

980
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,800
Yes.

981
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,480
We made it. We won.

982
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,320
Nice.

983
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,320
We won! We won! We won!

984
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
The flash with the ultimate skill was great.

985
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,480
Let's go.

986
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,320
Congratulations. Congratulations.

987
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,110
Congratulations. Congratulations.

988
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,110
Congratulations. Congratulations.

989
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,550
Come on.

990
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,630
Congratulations. Congratulations.

991
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,360
I finally know

992
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,190
why you said we were not suitable that day.

993
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,590
Hope you can be happy.

994
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,880
I said we would shake hands again.

995
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,230
And here it comes.

996
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,320
Come on.

997
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,880
Hope we can meet again
at the World Championships.

998
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,230
OK. See you at the World Championships.

999
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,190
Deal.

1000
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,670
