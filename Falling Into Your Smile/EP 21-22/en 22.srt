00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,030
What's your answer?

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,640
Excuse me?

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,640
Don't be so loud.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,760
Other people don't know it yet.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,830
Can you two date with each other

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,070
in a normal way?

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,670
(Oh my God!)

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,070
(Why is Jinyang involved in this?)

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,470
From today on,

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,640
the road ahead is,

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,600
I will never look back.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,200
(YQCB midsolo slept with his fan?)

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,600
(Or is it that the fan slept with him?)

(We can see in this game,)

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,280
(YQCB's topsolo Rong has chosen Aobouzu.)

21
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,150
(Group Match of Group B - Game 7)
(The jungler Kim Eun-seok uses Itsumade.)

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
(YQCB vs. ALPHA)
(The midsolo Ai Jia has locked on Higanbana.)

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,950
(And the shooter Hierophant has also
chosen Youko, which he is good at.)

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
(While the support Liang Sheng uses Ebisu.)

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
Hierophant, Hierophant, Hierophant.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
So far in the match,

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,430
(YQCB has already destroyed)

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,150
(Alpha's first turret of the bottom lane.)

29
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,030
Come here, Liang Sheng.

30
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,400
Come to me.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,710
(Is there going to be a team fight?)

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,750
(That's right.)

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,240
(Look, look. It's really happening!)

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,310
(It's really happening!)

35
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,800
Look!

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
There is a team fight.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,400
Liang Sheng, make an ult.

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,310
I'll do it.

39
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,960
(But Alpha's shooter and support)

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
(have come to support.)

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,030
Look.

42
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,580
(Liang Sheng makes an ult)

43
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,080
(in front of Hierophant.)

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm coming.

45
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,630
(That's right.
Look, Ai Jia also rushes to support.)

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,360
(Before Mannendake could rush to Hierophant,)

47
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,310
(Ai Jia preempts the attack.)

48
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,800
Nice.

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,910
(He directly stuns Mannendake.)

50
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,440
Hierophant managed to get away.

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,910
If Higanbana had been a little late,

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,600
Hierophant would have really been in danger.

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,680
Ai Jia did a great job in the team fight.

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,470
How did this cameraman give Ai Jia

55
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,750
such a big shot?

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,030
He's been in a state of worry

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,400
for the past few days,

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,840
and so has a big pimple on his forehead.

59
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,190
All right, great job.

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,080
Jinyang, even I felt concerned about

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,430
how Ai Jia did just now.

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,840
Can't you feel the tension?

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,080
If he loses this game,

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,400
you'll have to take the blame.

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,590
But I don't understand it.

66
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,680

when I met him,

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,950
he was just a little kid.

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,390

She can't understand the game,

and she doesn't know how to play it either.

151
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,830
She was with him

152
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,920
just because of the player's celebrity effect

153
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,510

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
Now the reputation of female fans

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,920

If you like the players,

162
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,310

163
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,270
Why do you have to seduce them?

164
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,000
What you're saying makes sense.

165
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,120
If we're about to fight with them,
save it for after the game.

166
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,600
Look at that idiot

167
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,430
who is playing so optimistically on stage.

168
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,240
If I fight with his fans offstage,

169
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,270
what a mess would that be?

170
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,240
But you can't let them say that about you.

171
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920

YQCB chose Yama Usagi and Palm Civet.

184
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,560
Ibaraki Douji is for jungler.

185
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,070
Ai Jia is using Yuki Onna.

186
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,950
It's obvious

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,390
Hierophant's Hakurou
is used by the four preserving one.

188
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,160
They probably want to test the tactic.

189
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,070
But I think they're

190
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,310
not fully skilled

191
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,560
at this four-preserving-one system.

192
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,830
Plus

193
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,870
Alpha's jungler uses Kosodenote,

194
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,040
which is also hard to fight.

195
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,270
Once they can see through
the intention of the opponent's lineup…

196
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,430
The situation in the bottom lane
will be terrible.

197
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,430
Alpha's jungler

198
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,600
can do relatively little in an inferior game.

199
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,390
But he is a world-class player

200
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,920
in a superior game.

201
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,430
Now their speed of advance is very fast.

202
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,950
(Look, now we can see)

203
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,190
Alpha's jungler Zero

204
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,480
(is about to gank the bottom lane,)

205
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,630
(making a surprise attack.)

206
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,560
(Yes, but look,)

207
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,390
(Ai Jia's Yuki Onna
doesn't seem to be aware of that.)

208
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,190
(She didn't go to support.)

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
(- We can take the fight.)
(- Go.)

210
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,830
(Come on.)

211
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,310
(Look at the fight now.)

212
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,310
(Hierophant's Hakurou seems to be in danger.)

213
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,480
(It's not going to last much longer.)

214
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,750
(We can see that now)

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,310
(YQCB is following
a four-preserving-one strategy.)

216
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,240
(Double Kill)
(Hierophant was killed first.)

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,830
(It's a great slash of morale.)

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,870
(Kosodenote didn't return to the jungle)

219
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,270
(but went straight
to the middle lane instead.)

220
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
(Could it be that he wants to
pull the carpet out from under feet?)

221
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,440
Ai Jia, watch out!

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
(I was right, wasn't I?)

223
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,700
(Killingspree.)

224
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,080
Look!

225
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,550
Ai Jia didn't react to it at all.

226
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,120
Instead, Kim Eun-seok came to support him.

227
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
He got ganked too.

228
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,630
(YQCB changed their play style this time.)

229
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,750
(There's no tacit cooperation at all.)

230
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,150
(Ai Jia's performance was embarrassing.)

231
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,670
(That's true.)

232
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,670
(It's like Ai Jia went back to
his old style of play.)

233
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,320
It's almost the same opening
as the last game.

234
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,600
(He frees the support to gank
in the middle lane together with him,)

235
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,910
(and catches YQCB's combination
of midsolo and jungler.)

236
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,870
(They should choose the top lane next,)

237
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,750
(and gank the topsolo)

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,670
(or wait for the refreshed monster
and take it.)

239
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,550
(According to statistics,)

240
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,240
(they're more likely to catch the topsolo.)

241
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,120
(Rong's Palm Civet
is on its way to support Ai Jia.)

242
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,150
(He hasn't had a chance to turn back yet.)

243
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:11,960
(Chase them.)

244
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,750
(And the jungler intercepted him.)

245
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,120
(Defeat)
(Directly chase him to death!)

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,960
Five minutes.

247
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,840
Five deaths in five minutes.

248
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,390
The two bottom shikigamis
haven't even reached level six.

249
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,630
YQCB didn't follow the right rhythm.

250
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
It seems that four-preserving-one tactics

251
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,440
won't work in this season.

252
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,630
But Cheng and Hierophant

253
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,360
really just follow the exact same tactics.

254
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
No matter what the lineup is,
they just go up and start a fight.

255
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,360
But,

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,630
Hierophant is a little more
aggressive than Cheng.

257
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,600
Since Hierophant collapsed,
I don't think they can win the game anymore.

258
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,670
With Yuki Onna being the midsolo,
there won't be any damage.

259
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,670
To be honest,

260
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,440
I don't really understand

261
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,870
why he would choose Yuki Onna?

262
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,360
Any attack-oriented shikigami

263
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
should be better than it.

264
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,910
Yes.

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,630
Sometimes you can't ignore

266
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,600
the version.

267
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,840
If you want to take out
a four-preserving-one lineup,

268
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,910
the opponent will have a strategy
to deal with your tactics.

269
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,510
(Ai Jia in this game)

270
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,440
(has completely lost the right rhythm.)

271
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,480
(Hierophant has no chance to attack damage)

272
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,120
(and is too far behind in gold.)

273
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
We can take this. Go.

274
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,870
Come here, protect me.

275
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,720
(Protect the attack.)

276
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,670
(We can take this.)

277
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,790
(We can take this.)

278
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,120
(Come on. Hurry.)

279
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,270
(Chase after them. Follow up.)

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,200
(Not full-blooded anymore.)

281
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,440
(Retreat.)

282
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,790
(Go.)

283
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,670
(Shut Down)
(YQCB's four-preserving-one tactic)

284
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,120
(has already been figured out by Alpha.)

285
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,320
(After the shooter is killed,)

286
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,200
(the other players are like)

287
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,960
("fish on a chopping board
to be slaughtered.")

288
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,200
(Defeat)
(There isn't enough attack of damage.)

289
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
(It's like being strung-up
and beaten, isn't it?)

290
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,790
(Double Kill)
(That's right.)

291
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,240
(But I'm afraid it's too late)

292
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,320
(to change the tactics.)

293
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,600
(Ace.)

294
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,910
(Alpha has pushed up to the base turret.)

295
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,780
(Support needed for our junction)
(Hierophant is coming back to life soon.)

296
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,550
Hierophant is back.

297
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,510
But I don't think there is any chance.

298
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,600
(Defeat)
(Hakurou didn't get developed in the early stage.)

299
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,720
(There is no way to fight back.)

300
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,910
(Without having killed a single Minion,)

301
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,240
(he died in his own base.)

302
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,030
(Exploded!)

303
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,270
(Congratulations to Alpha
for winning the game!)

304
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,120
(Congratulations to Alpha!)

305
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,510
(Congratulations!)

306
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,080
I said they couldn't play like that.

307
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,870
(It's okay. Next game.)

308
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,270
(Ai Jia didn't perform well in this game,)

309
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,240
(forming a stark contrast to the last game.)

310
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,150
Your boyfriend has lost the game.

311
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,200
What's wrong with that? It's just one game.

312
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,630
It's not like I haven't seen him lose before.

313
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
He hasn't won even a few times
during the whole Spring Playoffs.

314
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,870
Why is this one unacceptable?

315
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
It doesn't matter.

316
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
There's still another game, right?

317
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,240
It'll be fine if he wins the next game.

318
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,200
What are you doing?

319
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,320
What does she mean by that?

320
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,510
What does she mean it doesn't matter?

321
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
Why doesn't it matter?

322
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,440
That's right.

323
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,240
It's all because of people like you

324
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,750
that the contestants
would be so indifferent to matches.

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We came all the way here

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,670
just to see them win.

327
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,240
Please don't say such

328
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,870
annoying things.

329
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,240
Ai Jia.

330
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,200
Ai Jia.

331
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,960
My friend

332
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,670
didn't mean…

333
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,390
Let's go.

334
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,510
- What are you doing?
- Go.

335
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,200
Why do you bother about such people?

336
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,390
No, what? What do you mean such people?

337
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm a fan of yours!

338
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
Yes, you heard it right.

339
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,670
I've never said
such harsh things to my girlfriend.

340
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,510
Who are you to go on rambling here?

341
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,200
What does she have to do
with how well I played?

342
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,360
If there is a problem,

343
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
come to me.

344
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,390
Let's go.

345
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
That's so cool!

346
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,140
That's super interesting.

347
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,120
I've never seen such a boyfriend.

348
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
So handsome.

349
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,480
Good for him.

350
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,870
Nice, nice.

351
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,390
So cool. Such a spotlight.

352
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,750
Really so cool.

353
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,870
Put me down.

354
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you crazy?

355
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,080
Why did you jump off the stage?

356
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Did I have to stand by?

357
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,840
Of course.

358
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,790
I can put up with anything
for your competition.

359
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,840
Why do you have to put up with it?

360
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,550
Let me tell you.

361
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,390
I've been angry for days.

362
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
Gaming is my own business.

363
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
Being in love is my own business.

364
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,840
Winning or losing is also my own business.

365
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,750
I just can't stand

366
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,030
them blaming you.

367
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,080
If they want to criticize you,

368
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,390
they should judge me too.

369
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,790
I don't spoil them.

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,480
Why does my girlfriend

371
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,150
who's been spoiled by me

372
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,840
has to be bullied by those

373
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,550
who don't know us at all?

374
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,840
And

375
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,870
they did this

376
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,840
in the name of defending me personally.

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,750
How can I put up with that?

378
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,030
And why should you put up with it?

379
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,360
Do we owe them?

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,630
Who are they?

381
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,550
What are you, a fool?

382
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,200
It's as if I'd be cut off
just by being judged by them.

383
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,790
Stupid, aren't you childish?

384
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm childish?

385
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
I told you.

386
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,240
As long as I'm with you,

387
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,550
no matter if it's a mountain of fire
or an abyss of ten thousand feet ahead of me,

388
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
I will wade through even with my eyes closed.

389
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
At first

390
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,390
I didn't understand your dream of e-sports.

391
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,000
But since I returned to China,

392
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,510
and after the opening game,

393
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,080
I've watched you play games
step by step until now.

394
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,600
Although I still don't understand
all those operations,

395
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,670
such as turret breaking…

396
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,790
It's turret crossing.

397
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,150
No matter what turret it is,

398
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,510
I just know

399
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
you're not going to leave the stage of gaming

400
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
at least for the first half of your life.

401
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,510
I also know,

402
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
you can't leave me, for your entire life.

403
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,030
Therefore,

404
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,150
I won't play a bitter drama,

405
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,510
making you choose

406
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,480
between gaming and your girlfriend.

407
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,270
Since I have already made up my mind,

408
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,030
I won't regret.

409
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,910
If I can't even bear this little fight,

410
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,600
how could I fall in love with you?

411
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,600
Being together with people like you,

412
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,750
I just need to accept
the attention and judging, right?

413
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,080
My boyfriend is so capable.

414
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,270
He's a star in the e-sports industry.

415
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,480
Whether they give their blessings or not,

416
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,750
our future

417
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,670
has nothing to do with them.

418
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,870
I'm not kidding.

419
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,030
Whether it's a mountain of fire
or an abyss of ten thousand feet,

420
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll…

421
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,790
That's tough.

422
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,750
It is indeed tough for Jinyang.

423
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,960
These keyboard warriors
are short of oxygen tanks again.

424
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
(What the hell is with Ai Jia?)

425
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,270
(Did he come to play the game
or play in a South Korean drama?)

426
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,080
- Yes.
(- Yes, I now believe)

427
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,510
(that woman is a rich girl.)

428
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,080
(Make a lot of money
in order to get with girls.)

429
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,150
(with his identity as a contestant.)

430
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,200
What are you thinking about?

431
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,480
Ai Jia didn't do anything.

432
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,750
He just spoke a little loudly.

433
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
He won't be banned, right?

434
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,750
He won't be punished, right?

435
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,120
Jinyang didn't do anything either.

436
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,600
She usually can't take any losses.

437
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,030
Today, she suffered all the grievance

438
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,720
so that Ai Jia could rest assured
in playing the game.

439
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,750
What more do they want?

440
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,960
They're just in a relationship.

441
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,480
How can there be so many reasons?

442
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,910
How can there be so many schemes and tricks?

443
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,960
If you really like a person,

444
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,720
who cares if the person

445
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,150
is a famous player or a star?

446
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,440
You just like the person, that's it.

447
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,670
Players are human too.

448
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,360
They also have their own loved ones,

449
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,120
who they want to be with.

450
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,910
What's wrong with that?

451
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,440
Or is it fundamentally wrong

452
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
to think that way?

453
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,880
Because as a public figure,

454
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,000
your body, hair and skin

455
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,550
all don't belong to you in the first place.

456
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,830
The reason we exist

457
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,110
is to win the game,

458
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,310
to please the fans

459
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,310
and to play for the team.

460
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,750
So we will do whatever it takes

461
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,400
to accomplish all these things.

462
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,510
This seems to be very right.

463
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,350
Of course, there are many people
who think this way.

464
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,310
But if even the players themselves

465
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,590
also think so,

466
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,720
that'll be bad.

467
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,750
Winning and losing is of course important.

468
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
But compared to the fans'

469
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,000
satisfaction with the results,

470
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,680
we are the ones
who should face the results frankly.

471
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,480
So, to put it selfishly,

472
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,070
this is our business.

473
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,350
Thank you for your love and support.

474
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,200
But whether we win or lose

475
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,680
really doesn't seem to be your business.

476
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,310
That's the right thing to say.

477
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,640
You're too sensible.

478
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,270
Unlike me,

479
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,920
I'll always be affected by them.

480
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,070
I'll have a psychological collapse.

481
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,790
I'll be sad. I'll be upset.

482
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,480
Everyone is like that.

483
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,350
But you don't seem to be like that.

484
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,070
Cheng.

485
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,550
Are you really so strong
that you're fearless?

486
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,070
Yes, I am.

487
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,350
Because I have to protect you.

488
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,590
Forget it.

489
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,720
Give me a hug.

490
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,640
Why do you sound

491
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,750
as if the world was coming to an end?

492
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,880
When I think about the fact that

493
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,350
such good pectoral and abdominal muscles

494
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,590
may not belong to me anymore tomorrow,

495
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,880
it's really like the end of the world.

496
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,420
(Victory)

497
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,640
I feel so sorry for the team next door
for losing this game.

498
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,350
Good thing they won it back later.

499
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,310
After all this,

500
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,000
what tactics will we use later?

501
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,790
Ming.

502
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,160
I have an immature idea.

503
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,960
Can we use
the four-preserving-one tactic again?

504
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,000
Four-preserving-one tactic?

505
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,590
Reason?

506
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
No reason.

507
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,830
Now such a lineup is very controversial.

508
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,110
Everyone thinks

509
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,310
the team that
sticks to this tactic this season

510
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,310
won't be able to win.

511
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,440
But the last time we played against DQ.Five,

512
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
we used this tactic in the second game.

513
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,790
And we played quite well.

514
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,680
So I want to try it again.

515
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,750
I wonder if we can still use it.

516
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,400
Isn't there a saying that

517
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
"practice is the only criterion
to test the truth?"

518
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,480
You want to take Yuki Onna?

519
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,680
Yuki Onna?

520
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,920
Didn't Ai Jia take Yuki Onna just now

521
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,000
and lost.

522
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
The fact that they lost the last game

523
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,790
has nothing to do
with Ai Jia taking Yuki Onna.

524
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,920
Shooter is the key
in the four-preserving-one system.

525
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,960
Tong Yao.

526
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,160
You seem to be doing it for someone.

527
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,960
With so much bullshit,

528
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,310
you just want to

529
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,960
do justice to your bestie to show that

530
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,350
whether they lost the game or not

531
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,640
has nothing to do with
whether Ai Jia has a girlfriend or not.

532
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,790
That's fine.

533
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,680
Hierophant is so popular.

534
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
No matter what the result is,

535
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,510
someone will defend him.

536
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
They lost the last game.

537
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,720
He's the one who will take the biggest blame.

538
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,480
It's good to show him

539
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,960
what a real four-preserving-one lineup is

540
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,550
and let him lose two or three days of sleep.

541
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,790
It may be a good thing.

542
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,590
So...

543
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,550
I agree.

544
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,310
Okay, okay, okay.

545
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,030
I'll take Ibaraki Douji later.

546
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
Let's go back to the Spring Playoffs.

547
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,640
Use obsolete shikigami regardless of version.

548
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Use outdated tactics regardless of version.

549
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,960
You guys have really
got your heads in the clouds.

550
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,480
How did I end up with such a messed-up team?

551
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,310
You've messed up too!

552
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,640
You can take Ichimoku Ren.

553
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,270
Cat is right.

554
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Take Ichimoku Ren later.

555
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,720
You go support Cat.
I'll play alone at the bottom lane.

556
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,980
Just like dreaming about going back
to the Spring Playoffs.

557
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,610
Spring Playoffs.

558
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,960
Go back to the Spring Playoffs.

559
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
(Group Match of Group A - Game 8)

560
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,060
(ZGDX vs. Orcs of Doom)

561
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,480
Tong Yao.

562
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,750
Are you sure?

563
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,900
(Onmyoji Arena)

564
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,440
(Okay, now the ten players on the field)

565
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,000
(have chosen their shikigamis.)

566
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,310
(Let's take a look
at the final lineup of shikigamis.)

567
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,310
(ZGDX's topsolo, Cat)

568
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,590
(has got Kuro Douji.)

569
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,400
(For the jungler, K is Ibaraki Douji.)

570
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,720
(The midsolo Smiling is Yuki Onna.)

571
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,270
(The shooter Chessman is Hakurou.)

572
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,680
(The support Chubby is Ichimoku Ren.)

573
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,350
(As for Orcs of Doom,
the topsolo is Shuten Douji.)

574
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,440
(The jungler is Youtou Hime.)

575
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,000
(The midsolo is Menreiki.)

576
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,510
(There are Doumeki and the support Higanbana
on the bottom lane.)

577
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,070
About these ten shikigamis,

578
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,680
(what do you think of them, Qiu?)

579
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,270
I think today ZGDX

580
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,200
(seems to want to stir up trouble.)

581
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,510
(Smiling has chosen Yuki Onna.)

582
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,960
(What is going on in today's game?)

583
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,680
(Maybe this is the case with Smiling.)

584
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
(She was influenced by YQCB's last game.)

585
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,310
She is like, you took Yuki Onna,

586
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,720
and you didn't play well, right?

587
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,750
Then I'll take Yuki Onna

588
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,720
to teach you how to play it.

589
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,790
Smiling isn't as good as Ai Jia

590
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,030
at playing this kind of
functional midsolo shikigami.

591
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,270
If she thinks so,

592
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,160
she's a little too condescending.

593
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm just... I'm just kidding.

594
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,030
ZGDX is still going to play
four-preserving-one tactics in this game.

595
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,160
What's wrong with
a four-preserving-one lineup?

596
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,030
What's wrong with
the four-preserving-one lineup?

597
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,920
Didn't you see

598
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,350
YQCB followed such a tactic
to protect Hierophant

599
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,350
and failed in the last game?

600
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,680
That was Hierophant.

601
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,160
He is not worse than Cheng.

602
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,790
Let's go!

603
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,790
Go for it!

604
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,000
(Don't say I didn't remind you
not to talk such nonsense.)

605
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,200
(After the game,)

606
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
(look at your Weibo after going back.)

607
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,350
(You'll know what's going on.)

608
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,070
(Battle)
(Okay, let's start the game.)

609
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,790
(Now the shikigamis of the both sides)

610
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,510
(have arrived at their own lines.)

611
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,110
(Yuki Onna at the middle lane will be facing)

612
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,350
(Menreiki.)

613
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,790
Let's go down the lane.

614
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,440
(Menreiki and Youtou Hime)

615
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,000
(have already started to move down.)

616
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,550
(They'll target Chubby and Chessman)

617
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,480
(together with Doumekiand and Higanbana.)

618
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,030
Wait for me. Wait for me.

619
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,830
- Chubby, withdraw.
- Okay.

620
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,550
(They're about to block ZGDX's players
on the bottom lane,)

621
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,440
(and won't let them go.)

622
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,440
(Look, now Chubby and Chessman)

623
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,750
(have to stay under the turret.)

624
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,400
Go over the turret. Don't let them go.

625
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,880
We can fight, we can fight.

626
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,790
(As expected of Higanbana,
she directly went into the turret.)

627
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,880
(These three people of Orcs of Doom)

628
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,510
(went over the turret to kill.)

629
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,350
(First Blood)

630
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,480
(This is an extraordinary cooperation.)

631
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,240
- Nice. Nice.
(- Nice.)

632
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,550
(Menreiki and Higanbana)

633
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,310
(unleashed an ult on Chessman
at the same time.)

634
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,270
(K's Ibaraki Douji)

635
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,480
(controlled Doumeki who was coming.)

636
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,070
I'll hold on. I'll hold on. It's okay.

637
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm on. I'm on. I'm on.

638
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,880
The opponent's jungler is on.

639
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,270
- Good.
- That was good.

640
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,510
- Good for you, young man.
- Very good.

641
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,590
ZGDX is really inferior in this game.

642
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,200
If I were playing like this
in my usual ranking,

643
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
I probably would give up long ago.

644
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,680
But apparently ZGDX didn't give up.

645
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,960
Cat, you go too.

646
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
Come on, let's go too.

647
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,160
(The snake pit.)

648
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,200
(Is the snake pit about to
experience a chaotic fight?)

649
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,110
Come on, come on.

650
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
(Menreiki has been attacking damage
with her ult.)

651
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,350
(K and Cat both have little blood left.)

652
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,240
(Do they still have to fight again?)

653
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,790
Ult, ult!

654
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,720
(Shuten, Shuten, is in!)

655
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,590
(Hit him! Hit him!)

656
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,400
(They're about to kill several people.)

657
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,310
(Legendary)
(Orcs of Doom cooperated well,)

658
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,960
(killing Cat and K.)

659
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,960
(Double Kill)

660
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,240
Nice, good.

661
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,310
Not bad.

662
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,350
Chubby, Tong Yao, lead the pace

663
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,240
and give me time to develop.

664
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:13,750
Okay.

665
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,200
Chubby, follow me.

666
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,750
Here we go.

667
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,270
(Smiling! Smiling makes an ult,)

668
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,750
(blowing up the low-blooded
Menreiki and Higanbana.)

669
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,480
Counterattack, counterattack, go!

670
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,660
(Defeat)

671
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,330
-Go after them.
- Go on chasing them.

672
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,720
(Chubby accelerates in a flash
and stroke them right off the board.)

673
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,790
(Menreiki and Higanbana were killed.)

674
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,510
Nice!

675
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,240
(ZGDX started a nice zero-for-two fight.)

676
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,680
(It's not a bad move!)

677
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,790
(Rampage)
(It's really not bad!)

678
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,680
(What a great switch of deaths!)

679
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,720
(It's really awesome!)

680
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,030
Smiling grasped

681
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,790
the rhythm and timing super well just now.

682
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,640
And Chubby was tacit too.

683
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,750
You can see that

684
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,350
Yuki Onna can still be chosen.

685
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,110
We can see

686
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,680
Chessman took the advantage very well.

687
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,550
(He's already begun to collect the line
to make up for his development.)

688
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,240
(Yes, that's right.)

689
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,270
(Why? Because Chessman)

690
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,750
is the preserved one
in the four-preserving-one lineup,

691
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,110
and is in the core attack position.

692
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,590
When being left behind in gold,

693
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,030
(he can only let Smiling lead the team)

694
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,030
(to play some small team fights)

695
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,830
(and ensure his development time.)

696
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,510
(But Orcs of Doom found this out…)

697
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,160
We can confront this.

698
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,880
I'll go around.

699
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,030
I'll go down. I'll go down.

700
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,510
Youtou Hime is already in an ambush position.

701
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,030
(Chessman's Hakurou is in danger again.)

702
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,750
(Youtou Hime appeared
in a flash to attack Hakurou.)

703
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
(Chessman quickly reacted to dodge it.)

704
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,000
(Yes, put out skills to hit him instead.)

705
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,880
(Chessman's operations
are as fierce as a tiger.)

706
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,880
(Kill back!)

707
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,830
(What happened to Chessman?)

708
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,960
Surprisingly, he was able to
kill Youtou Hime with Hakurou alone.

709
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,200
(It's amazing!)

710
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,720
- Cool.
- Cheng. Good for you.

711
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,880
(Now we can see the player of Orcs of Doom)

712
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,270
(has already made it to the snake pit.)

713
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,110
(They seems to be trying
to stabilize their gold first.)

714
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,510
The midsolo is gone.

715
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,480
The two on the top lane are also gone.

716
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,640
They want to make money with the Orochi?

717
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,400
Cheng, are we going to ambush?

718
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,510
Okay, you guys go ambushing first.

719
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,070
- Okay.
- Let's go.

720
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,790
This way.

721
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,400
(Orcs of Doom are already
hitting the Orochi.)

722
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,200
We can pick the fight.

723
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,720
(ZGDX has also arrived,)

724
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,440
(preparing to ambush near the Snake Pit.)

725
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,240
(Is this a way to steal the gold?)

726
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,270
I'm already in position.

727
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,270
Me too!

728
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,310
Skills are refreshed.

729
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
(Chessman is still
in the middle lane clearing the line.)

730
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,790
(Are they not going to fight?)

731
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,110
Are they going to give up the Orochi to them?

732
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,590
(Chessman is still in the middle lane.)

733
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,440
Cheng, we're about to lose the Orochi.

734
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,680
(If they give up this Orochi,)

735
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,640
(it's like giving away)

736
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,790
(the victory of this game.)

737
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,240
Cheng, it's really too late.

738
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
Cheng, come over here.

739
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
It's up to you to turn the tables.

740
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,790
Come on, Cheng!

741
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,030
Wait a little longer.

742
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,400
We can make it.

743
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
(Orochi has ran out of blood.)

744
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,590
(Chessman is still
in the middle lane, not coming.)

745
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,070
(What's he waiting for?)

746
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,550
(Orcs of Doom have an advantage
in gold at this moment.)

747
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,830
(Take the Orochi,)

748
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
(and once the army line comes up,)

749
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,680
(ZGDX will have a hard time
turning the tables.)

750
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,310
- Cheng.
- Still not going?

751
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,760
I'll reach full-leveled in three seconds.
Wait for me.

752
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,030
What did I see?

753
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,790
Chessman's Hakurou is almost fully leveled.

754
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,750
Then it looks like
they're likely to take the Orochi.

755
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,640
Hakurou has a long attack distance

756
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
after reaching level 18,

757
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,270
and also has a high burst of damage,
making it difficult to be ganked.

758
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,680
Feels like the tide is going to turn.

759
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,960
Three.

760
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,480
(Just one more Minion, just one more Minion.)

761
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,550
(Just one more Minion.)

762
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,070
- Can he catch it?
- Can he catch it?

763
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,200
Two.

764
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,640
One.

765
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,110
We can start the team fight. Go.

766
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,850
- Keep an eye on my position.
- Good.

767
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,160
- Let's go!
- K, get your Subdue prepared.

768
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,240
Chubby and I will go together.

769
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,920
- Here we go. Tong Yao, take an ult.
- Let's wait and see.

770
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,310
Cheng, I'll block for you. Go!

771
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,200
Cheng, watch out!

772
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,400
I'm coming!

773
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,740
(Victory)

774
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,790
(Exploded!)

775
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,270
(Congratulations to ZGDX
for winning this game!)

776
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,480
Yes, yes, yes!

777
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,790
(Congratulations to ZGDX
for turning the tide!)

778
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,830
(Yes, that's right.)

779
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,160
(In this match,)

780
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,000
(Chessman succeeded
in making the most out of Hakurou's)

781
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,680
(horrific outburst of damage
in the mid-late stage)

782
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,440
after the equipment was formed,

783
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,440
leading ZGDX to win the game.

784
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,070
And of course,
the performance of Smiling in this game

785
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,160
was also very impressive.

786
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,440
She successfully proved that her Yuki Onna

787
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,550
can be taken on the field.

788
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,400
So

789
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,880
who says you have to
believe in the version, right?

790
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,510
I'll tell you what.

791
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,350
The tactic of four-preserving-one

792
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,750
seems to work.

793
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,260
(Onmyoji Arena)

794
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,070
First of all, congratulations to ZGDX today

795
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,240
for keeping your winning streak intact.

796
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Thank you. We may fail next time
because of what you said.

797
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,030
I'm also very surprised that YQCB

798
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,350
didn't leave the site even after the game,

799
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,070
giving us this special

800
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,400
post-match group interview opportunity.

801
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,240
Actually, we wanted to leave.

802
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
But the coach wouldn't let us.

803
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
He held us down in the lounge

804
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,830
just to show us how to play
the four-preserving-one tactic.

805
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,830
Because it was a new tactic.

806
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,480
So we weren't very skilled at it.

807
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,480
Hello, I want to ask ZGDX:

808
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,550
the four-preserving-one strategy

809
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,830
doesn't really work

810
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,110
in the current version where the ADC is weak,

811
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,030
so why did you

812
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,110
still insist on this tactic

813
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,920
after the failure of YQCB?

814
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,510
Our midsolo said

815
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,680
she also wanted to try out
the four-preserving-one tactic

816
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,000
and try playing Yuki Onna.

817
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,270
I thought it would work.

818
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,510
I thought I could teach

819
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,000
other shooters how to play the tactic.

820
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,240
So we played two games of it.

821
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,270
Okay, thanks.

822
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,880
He said he wanted to teach you
how to play a four-preserving-one lineup.

823
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,920
I'd like to ask YQCB:

824
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,640
After the second game today,

825
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,720
there was a little accident.

826
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
In the third game, player Ai Jia

827
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,550
didn't appear in the starting lineup.

828
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,070
Have you been banned from the game?

829
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,750
Fans would like to know the answer.

830
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,750
Actually, it goes like this:

831
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,000
In the third game,
it was  the result of a discussion

832
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,480
between the coaching staff and the players,

833
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,680
to put the substitute on the field.

834
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,030
I know

835
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,960
there are a lot of people
spreading rumors on the Internet,

836
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,030
saying that Ai Jia acted like a diva
and refused to play.

837
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,440
Actually, it's not true.

838
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,110
Please stop saying that.

839
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
In fact, it was because

840
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
Ai Jia was not in a good mood.

841
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,590
We thought it would be more appropriate

842
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,830
for the substitute to play.

843
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,160
That's why we replaced him.

844
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,960
Let me ask you.

845
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,830
Why would he be in a bad mood?

846
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,590
Didn't you see?

847
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,350
Ai Jia.

848
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,310
Stop it.

849
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,550
I want to ask.

850
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,480
All this time

851
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,440
there has been constant talk of the players'

852
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,310
private love lives.

853
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,830
As professional players,

854
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,000
what do you think about this?

855
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,200
Let's just let nature take its course.

856
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,480
We don't think too much about that.

857
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,550
We spend most of our time training every day.

858
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,480
We don't have much time
to meet people outside.

859
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,550
So most of us are still single.

860
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,960
That...

861
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,880
That doesn't mean we're in a monks' temple.

862
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,230
It's not that we can't find someone

863
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,710
nor that we don't want to…

864
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,440
It's not that we aren't allowed to either.

865
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,710
Anyway, you'll have to figure out
what's going on here.

866
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,710
But many fans still hope that players

867
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,030
can focus on the game

868
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,710
and win the world championship
at the world tournament.

869
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
They shouldn't think
too much about other things.

870
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,920
For example,
during the live ranking training,

871
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,400
they might as well just look
through the match data.

872
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,760
And during the ranking match,

873
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,840
they shouldn't play other weird mini-games.

874
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,070
In places like special group,

875
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,230
aren't there always posts about this?

876
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,150
Fans want you to play the game seriously,

877
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,360
and win the world championship

878
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,710
striving to achieve good results.

879
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,590
Let me repeat what you just said

880
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,190
and see if it makes any sense.

881
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,320
Don't make any trouble.

882
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,920
There are many parents who

883
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,800
want their children to study hard,

884
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,150
and strive to be able to enter
Tsinghua University or Peking University

885
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,510
after the future
college entrance examination.

886
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,920
So they don't need to
think about anything else.

887
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,480
Just like they always hope

888
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,960
that when you take a break in class,

889
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,670
recite more English words

890
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,760
instead of playing those

891
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
weird little games.

892
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,320
Parents often discuss such topics.

893
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,550
But their original intention

894
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,510
is to inspire you to focus on your studies,

895
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,590
get good grades

896
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,710
and live a good life.

897
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,920
So it sounds reasonable.

898
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,590
But generally,

899
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,110
most of the fans who give that kind of advice

900
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,710
are of this age,

901
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,440
or maybe are working adults.

902
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,760
When asking professional players

903
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,960
who are also normal human beings to do this,

904
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,550
I'm not going to judge those

905
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,030
who are always ridiculing professionals
for not training properly

906
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,190
and only focusing on love affairs

907
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,480
or playing other games during breaks,

908
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,440
do they themselves take out their cell phones
to doodle and surf the Internet

909
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,280
in class

910
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,920
or at work?

911
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,360
I just hope

912
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,960
you can place yourself in our positions.

913
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,710
We are all very young.

914
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,670
Who hasn't spaced out in class?

915
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,550
Who hasn't slept in class?

916
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,320
Who hasn't peeked at
the prettiest girl in class?

917
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,880
Although I don't have similar experiences,

918
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,630
I want to ask, what's the difference
for professional players?

919
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,510
They have to be perfect, like saints?

920
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,230
No one is perfect.

921
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,030
It's very boring

922
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,230
if you judge the players all day long

923
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,590
for playing Tetris one day,

924
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,550
playing snake chasing tomorrow

925
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,440
or being in love the day after tomorrow.

926
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,550
We spend most of our time training.

927
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,110
Even the time we spend on training

928
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,070
is longer than some people's study time.

929
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,150
There are many people who have to break up

930
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,150
because of long-distance relationships

931
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,230
after graduating from high school.

932
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,920
And we who play professionally

933
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
can get dumped while playing e-sports.

934
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,150
Why?

935
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,920
Who do you think Cheng is talking about?

936
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,000
Why?

937
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,440
I suggest you go and interview

938
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,230
CK's jungler Yang.

939
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
He will tell you why.

940
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,880
He's talking about Smiling's ex-boyfriend.

941
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:58,960
Cheng.

942
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,190
You seem to know a lot about this.

943
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,360
I'm not young anymore

944
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,880
in this industry.

945
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,360
I've been playing professionally
for many years.

946
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,190
I've seen a lot too.

947
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,000
In that case,

948
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,670
Cheng has no objection

949
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,800
to players falling in love?

950
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,280
If it's not too much,

951
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm not against it.

952
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,630
I've heard

953
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,280
the legendary story of a boy and a girl

954
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,280
getting into Tsinghua University
and Peking University together.

955
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,230
Do you want to do the same, Cheng?

956
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,150
I already have someone I like.

957
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,030
Who is she?

958
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,760
Cheng also has someone he likes.

959
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,280
This is big news.

960
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,280
Big news.

961
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,150
He's got a crush on someone.

962
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,960
Oh my God!

963
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,480
He's got a crush on someone.

964
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,110
(He didn't say anything.)

965
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
(You didn't hear anything.)

966
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,840
(Don't blush. Don't blush.)

967
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,920
(Don't hyperventilate.)

968
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,000
(Calm down. Be calm.)

969
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,070
To some fans who are overly demanding,

970
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,710
do you have anything to say?

971
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,760
I'd like to thank you
for your support and love.

972
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,510
I will work hard for future matches.

973
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,110
If you can,

974
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,800
I hope that you can come to the scene
of the matches more often to support us.

975
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,440
And I'd like to say,

976
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,150
if you really like a professional player,

977
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,110
stay closer to his gaming stage

978
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,840
and stay away from his life.

979
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,920
Thank you.

980
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,760
You can't play like
you did just now, can you?

981
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,440
I'll teach you when you're free.

982
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,000
Forget it, I'll tell you.

983
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Shorty, let's go.

984
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,480
Let go of me.

985
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:50,920
Come on.

986
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,550
Without my wonderful playing

987
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,880
with the four-preserving-one lineup
in such an inferior game,

988
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,190
Ai Jia wouldn't have
been able to clear his name.

989
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,280
How will you thank me?

990
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,280
I'll kowtow to you.

991
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,110
No, you're being perfunctory again.

992
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,710
I'm not.

993
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,590
You are.

994
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,000
(Because I have to protect you.)

995
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,110
(Some people say)

996
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,630
(the meaning of love is probably)

997
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,360
("suddenly, there is a person in the world)

998
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,230
(who can give you everything you want.)

999
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,070
(He does everything he can)

1000
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,880
(without fear)

1001
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,670
