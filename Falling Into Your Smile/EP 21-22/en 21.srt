1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,600
(Two love rats make a perfect match.)

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,440
(Mistress.)

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,360
(He's a jerk, he doesn't deserve it.)

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,440
(Forget it, Guo.)

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,240
(Hsu Tae-lun is banned from the game.)

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,560
(We will no longer see him.)

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
(Thanks to you.)

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,030
(You're a really mean bitch.)

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you okay?

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,030
Did I ruin him?

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,920
If you had known,

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,320
then why would you
have done it in the first place?

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Cheng, why are you here?

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,390
What's going on?

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,560
Didn't they bring you an umbrella?

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,670
I hated her at first.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,670
But now I think

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,240
she's also sad being a fan at the same time,

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,150
though she is annoying.

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,960
Whether it's Hsu Tae-lun,

21
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,150
or us,

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,110
if we don't care about
the feelings of those who like us

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,710
and do whatever we want.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,880
Finally, we will get exposed and destroyed.

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,150
When I think about it,

26
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,150
I feel that maybe our industry
doesn't deserve

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,760
to be liked by others.

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,680
It's not that bad as you thought.

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,640
(I don't remember from what time on,)

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,950
(there's been a saying
in the e-sports circle that goes,)

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,120
("This e-sports doesn't believe in love.")

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,430
Do you want to give it a try?

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Try what?

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,640
Me.

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,950
(But you are an exception.)

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,980
=Falling Into Your Smile=

37
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,740
=Episode 21=

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,590
Cheng.

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,590
Would you please play by the rules?

40
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,280
I can't take it anymore with you
talking the talk but not walking the walk.

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,910
How many times
will you get tired of this joke?

42
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm telling you.

43
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,400
This time, I am not afraid.

44
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,800
Where are you going?

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,710
Sit back down.

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,240
What are you doing?

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
I didn't say anything,
why would you act like that?

48
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,590
Did I ask you to marry me on the spot?

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,630
You.

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
Don't talk nonsense.

51
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,840
Lu Sicheng, I should tell you.

52
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,960
You're not supposed to confess your love
to someone with that kind of tone

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,150
and such an expressions.

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,710
Even the peacock
flaunts its tail during courtship.

55
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,960
How can you be like this?

56
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,030
What have I done?

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,360
You're too fierce.

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,750
Then you'll agree
if I'm a little more gentle?

59
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,960
You see?

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,590
You're silent now.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,120
I really want to pull
Jian Yang and Hsu Tae-lun out

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,560
and beat them up.

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
How is this related to them?

64
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,590
Find a mirror and look at

65
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,190
how horrible your expression was just now.

66
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I wanted to wait a little longer

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,400
to confess to you at least after
we win a championship or something.

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,360
But now

69
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,630
I've seen your face like this,
I know I'm screwed.

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,720
If another one like Hsu Tae-lun shows up,

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,310
I don't have to wait until the finals

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,630
before you have already
been converted to Buddhism.

73
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,950
After all, there are so many scumbags
in this industry.

74
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,630
Unlike me.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm a good guy.

76
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,240
How about waiting until

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,270
we get the championship
in the national finals?

78
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,390
The right time,
the right place, the right people.

79
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,830
I think that's a good idea.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,870
It's time for you to take your medicine.

81
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,430
Do you have any principles?

82
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,750
Back when you asked me last time if I was

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,390
fearless and perfect,

84
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,750
I already said I wasn't.

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,240
If I'll end up seeing

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,510
the woman I love go to become a nun

87
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,270
for sticking to my principles,

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,950
then why should I stick to my principles?

89
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,360
To screw myself over?

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,160
So,

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,070
it's my one-sided love.

92
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,720
You never liked me.

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Then why did you ask me
not to meet my blind date,

94
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,000
pretending to sound like a jilted puppy

95
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,750
behind the chair?

96
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm going to be rejected then?

97
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,310
I wouldn't dare.

98
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
Then it's a yes?

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,270
No.

100
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,630
I see.

101
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,070
You just simply want to be beaten up.

102
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,160
You see!

103
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,600
That's the tone I mentioned.

104
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,680
The tone of the captain.

105
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,310
The tone of the team leader,
the tone of a father.

106
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,430
Whatever the tone is,

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,430
it doesn't sound like
a boyfriend's tone anyway.

108
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not saying you're my boyfriend.

109
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,390
Why are you smiling?

110
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,310
Hold back your smile.

111
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,190
Hold it back...

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,360
Whether I sound like a boyfriend or not,

113
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,430
how could you know
if you haven't given me the chance.

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,750
Stop shaking my hands.

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,270
A 20 something man
acting like a spoiled child.

116
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,040
That's cheating.

117
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,270
Think about it.

118
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,310
You have two hours

119
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,390
by 9 p.m.

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
Why 9 p.m.?

121
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,600
Because that's the time I'll decide

122
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,190
whether I will be able to
have a good sleep or not tonight.

123
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,390
Dry your hair before you catch a cold.

124
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,510
We have an interview later.

125
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,180
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

126
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,750
Tong Yao, calm down.

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,600
They seem not to be communicating
at all whatsoever today.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
Do you think they're having
an internal conflict?

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,040
If that's true,

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,870
we don't even have to do the interview today.

131
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,830
We can easily write

132
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,240
three columns out of this topic.

133
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,000
Hello, everyone,

134
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,270
for our next interview,

135
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,160
we have

136
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,630
Chessman and Smiling from the ZGDX team.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,920
Welcome.

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,830
So the first question for you is,

139
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,270
what is your opinion on
South Korean foreign aid

140
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,480
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League

141
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,120
recently?

142
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,600
You can't lump all of them together.

143
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,310
There are good ones as well,

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,630
such as the jungler in the FNC team

145
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,800
and the shooter in YQCB,

146
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,750
as well as other foreign aids in other teams.

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,950
It's a band-aid at best

148
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,510
and a way to get a quick result.

149
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
South Korean aids did bring with them

150
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,720
many new tactics and ways of gaming,

151
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,120
which are worth learning.

152
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,040
However, in order to strengthen our arena,

153
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,000
we can't be overdependent on foreign aids.

154
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,950
So what's the solution?

155
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Because I heard that

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,630
there was a boycott of
South Korean foreign aid among you guys.

157
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,750
So I want to ask you,

158
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,000
what is your attitude towards the boycott?

159
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,630
It is nothing like a boycott.

160
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,910
We need to strengthen regulation.

161
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,270
It's mostly up to the club.

162
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,670
It all comes down to conscientiousness.

163
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,750
Without self-discipline,
the club can't regulate anything either.

164
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,600
And,

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
one more thing I'd like to mention here,

166
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,600
is that this has nothing to do
with having foreign aid or not.

167
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,670
The same things happen
among domestic players as well.

168
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,000
Then we will move on to your opinion

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,960
on the relationship
between players and their fans.

170
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
As we all know,

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
the player Hsu Tae-lun was recently

172
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,390
exposed by a female fan

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,550
who once had
an improper relationship with him.

174
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,840
It's subtly co-existence.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,270
Keep a proper distance.

176
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,910
As a person interfering
in someone else's relationship,

177
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,870
whether it's a he or a she,

178
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,360
they're all unforgivable.

179
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,960
While as someone's fan,

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
he or she has to be fully aware

181
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,750
of whether they are having a prejudice

182
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,630
towards their favorite players.

183
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,200
It can be quite a scary thing

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,910
that is not advocated

185
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,240
to turn your simple, pure desire of love

186
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,150
into horrifying possessiveness.

187
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,200
It looks like Smiling

188
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,200
has taken quite a different angle

189
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,790
in looking at this as a girl.

190
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,240
But after hearing what you've both said,

191
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
do you mean to say that people in this circle

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
have flawed ways of life

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
in some way or another?

194
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,390
I mean, people are young,

195
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,200
and they tend to be easily misled

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,200
if they are exposed to
negative aspects of society too early.

197
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,150
Like students
who've just started attending school

198
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,750
and often made their teachers angry.

199
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,630
Hopefully they can have more self-restraint.

200
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,510
I don't know about any of that,

201
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,510
but I myself don't have
a problematic lifestyle anyway.

202
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,910
Besides,

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,870
I am someone you can trust with your life.

204
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
So being faced with

205
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,790
both the light and the dark sides
of the circle coexisting,

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I have a question for you two.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,080
Have you ever thought about

208
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,550
starting a relationship
with someone inside this circle?

209
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,630
Why not?

210
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,720
No?

211
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,910
I don't know.

212
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Okay.

213
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,910
That's all for today's interview.

214
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Thank you for coming.

215
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,960
Thank you.

216
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,440
Do you think

217
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,550
there is some chemistry going on
between Chessman and Smiling?

218
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,030
What do you mean?

219
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
Do you remember Chessman once said

220
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,120
that he likes girls
who can outperform him in e-sports?

221
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,440
Now that you mention it,

222
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,790
there does seem to be a connection.

223
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,670
Right, isn't there?

224
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,390
Let's get everything ready

225
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,960
after we go back.

226
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,120
Once they make an official announcement,

227
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
we can grab the headline.

228
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,360
Yeah.

229
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,840
- Let's go.
- Go.

230
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,630
You have two hours

231
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,200
by 9 p.m.

232
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
Which floor?

233
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,030
The 46th.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,870
Is that you?

235
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,630
Why?

236
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,870
The worst job

237
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,510
should be done by the man.

238
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,270
In fact, Tamamo-no-Mae to me

239
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,200
is like a kind of belief.

240
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,150
How about fostering a new belief

241
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
with the determination to win?

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,670
Let's go.

243
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,030
The whole world can see

244
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,550
that you lose on purpose.

245
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,910
I don't want you to go.

246
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,240
Come on, Smiling!

247
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,670
I knew that Lu Sicheng likes you
without a doubt.

248
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,150
He must have let you win intentionally.

249
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,030
Do you remember Lu Sicheng once said that

250
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,870
he like girls who can
outperform him in e-sports?

251
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,440
Eat after you put on your slippers.

252
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,440
Cheng.

253
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,870
One last question.

254
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,840
Are you just mad at me,

255
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,750
and that's why you've been ignoring me
for the past few days?

256
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,440
It's because I am afraid

257
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,030
that I would be too soft-hearted.

258
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,420
(ZGDX_Lu Sicheng Chessman:
#Highlight# 08:45 p.m.)

259
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,550
The Beijing time right now is

260
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,440
20:58:30.

261
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,000
I didn't know you could tell the time.

262
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,550
What's your answer?

263
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,480
I…

264
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,910
Think twice before saying.

265
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,870
Is this...

266
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,150
Yeah.

267
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,870
Although DQ.Five's base is a bit far away,

268
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,910
I still managed to

269
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,870
get the kitten back here.

270
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,030
Beijing time 20:59:30.

271
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,440
If I am still single after 30 seconds,

272
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I am going to take the kitten away with me.

273
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,600
Why don't you also hug me?

274
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,750
What are you looking at?

275
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,080
My kitten and my girl.

276
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,480
Why can't I look at them?

277
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,870
Who is your girl?

278
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,120
You are not a decent man
to take a kitten as a hostage.

279
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,510
All is fair in love and war.

280
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,550
If it were not for the kitten,

281
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,080
how would I be able to hug you?

282
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,000
Scoundrel.

283
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,380
(ZGDX_Smiling)

284
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,400
Hey, girl.

285
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,880
Biscuit's got a brother.

286
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,510
Are you crazy?

287
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,160
What time is it?

288
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
Girl, big news.

289
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
I am gonna tell you within 20 minutes.

290
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,160
Hurry.

291
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
I won't say a thing
if you are one second late.

292
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,350
Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

293
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,830
Big news?

294
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,920
I smell a sense of gossip.

295
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
Let's put on a carroty lipstick.

296
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,550
Is this the big news you are talking about?

297
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,880
This kitten looks a little familiar.

298
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
I know what you wanna ask.

299
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,750
I am also aware
that it is my right to remain silent.

300
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,110
But anything I say

301
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,200
can and will be used
as evidence in court of law.

302
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,160
This kitten

303
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
is exactly the one
that the scumbag Hsu Tae-lun

304
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,680
raised with his mistress fan.

305
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,920
That's it?

306
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,750
As Hsu Tae-lun was banned from the game,

307
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,070
he was not in any mood to raise a kitten.

308
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,400
So our captain

309
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,070
brought it here from DQ.Five.

310
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,110
I don't know if he paid or not.

311
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
It all happened last night.

312
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,640
I have a name for it.

313
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
It's called Scallion.

314
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,880
Because it is also my kitten.

315
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,790
And so this is the problem.

316
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,830
Why would a kitten have two owners?

317
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,680
The answer is,

318
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,510
there is an indescribable relationship

319
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,350
between me and my captain.

320
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,070
What?

321
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,960
That's exactly how it is.

322
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,350
What?

323
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,880
That's it.

324
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,110
Excuse me?

325
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,830
What?

326
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,160
You and who, Chessman?

327
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,310
Don't be so loud.
Other people don't know it yet.

328
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
What a girl, Mulan.

329
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,510
The enemy is still there

330
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,680
and the great e-sports cause
is yet to be realized.

331
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
And you've gone and slept with General Lu?

332
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,830
Not yet, not yet.

333
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I haven't slept with him.

334
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,270
You scheming girl!

335
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,830
You regret it, huh?

336
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,350
Keep your voice down.

337
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,880
So,

338
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,720
when are you going to test for

339
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,790
your post-doctorate of Tsinghua?

340
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,270
Do you hear the clapping in the air?

341
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,590
That's the sound of you
getting slapped in the face.

342
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,160
I actually didn't know this would happen.

343
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,480
Seriously.

344
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,270
It was yesterday
when we suddenly got on the topic.

345
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,000
And my captain
honey dicked me with the kitten.

346
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,480
I couldn't help but say yes in the moment.

347
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,720
But we are currently still on probation.

348
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,550
My captain says

349
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,790
practice is the sole criterion
for testing the truth.

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,830
What truth?

351
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,720
It's that he is a good man,

352
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,400
different from Hsu Tae-lun,

353
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,160
and so on.

354
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,960
Can you two

355
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,640
date with each other in a normal way?

356
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,510
It's fine if it's a secret.

357
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,750
But now what? An experiment?

358
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,400
Will you be able to return it
if you are not pleased?

359
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,240
Three months trial period.

360
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,270
Five years nation-wide guarantee.

361
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
Nice.

362
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,720
Well then, enjoy your trial.

363
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,440
Then we can't have a drink together,
how about next time?

364
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,070
We can play a training match together
when you're available.

365
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,440
We don't have a curfew,
let's talk again tomorrow morning.

366
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,350
Who are you talking to?

367
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,310
A normal social contact.

368
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,960
Who?

369
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,070
The shooter from next door.

370
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,920
Hierophant.

371
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,030
Is he a normal social contact?

372
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,310
You have no idea

373
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,510
what an epic thing your fans did at the airport,
carrying a light board

374
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,550
that has your name on it

375
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,240
on the first day
when Hierophant came to China.

376
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,960
What were you so happy about just now?

377
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,510
You don't read any books or the newspaper.

378
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
After what happened with Hsu Tae-lun,

379
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,920
and we stirred it up
during yesterday's interview.

380
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,590
The current public opinion is that

381
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,510
inside the professional circle,

382
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,590
none of us can regulate ourselves properly
whether we are from home or abroad.

383
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,830
And the country is now asking clubs
to strengthen management.

384
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,440
I was just asking Hierophant,

385
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,310
if he wanted to have an old-fashioned duel,

386
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,270
like having a drink together?

387
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,960
He said they are grounded.

388
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,160
The club now closes its door after 10 p.m.

389
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,960
and allows no one to go out,

390
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,640
unless there's a group activity,

391
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,720
otherwise you can only order take-away food
even if it means starving to death.

392
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,160
This kind of thing can happen?

393
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,480
Are they pushing it too far?

394
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,480
No wonder Ai Jia has become
so self-restrained

395
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,750
and has stopped going after Jinyang.

396
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,350
Rui.

397
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,110
Now that our neighbors are on the move.

398
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,400
We cannot afford to lag behind.

399
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,790
Don't we have access control for the base?

400
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,350
Our team members are more self-disciplined.

401
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,270
We don't have to do that.

402
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,510
What self-discipline?

403
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,480
Just now, your shooter

404
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,790
was asking another one out for a drink.

405
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,070
Let me go.

406
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,160
Let me go.

407
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,270
No.

408
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,350
Lu Sicheng, let go.

409
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,830
Tong Yao.

410
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,550
Come and see whether your kitten is hungry.

411
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
Let me see.

412
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,160
Let.

413
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,400
Let go of me.

414
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,750
Lu Sicheng.

415
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,680
I won't.

416
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,110
See.

417
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,440
You've caught a cold?

418
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,270
Are you hungry?

419
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,960
Are you hungry?

420
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,030
Let's have a look at your little belly.

421
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,480
Scallion.

422
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,550
Are you hungry?

423
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,160
(Your hands are so soft.)

424
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,160
(Scoundrel.)

425
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,000
(Lu Sicheng)
(Even the cats are living a better life than I am.)

426
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,440
(To Lu Sicheng)
(What?)

427
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,030
(The cat can cuddle its wife to sleep.)

428
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,790
(Biscuit has been castrated.)

429
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,070
(Even a castrated cat
can cuddle its wife to sleep.)

430
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,110
(Scallion is also a boy.)

431
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,720
(Even a castrated cat)

432
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,640
(can cuddle its castrated wife to sleep.)

433
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,400
(While you,
only have the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

434
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,680
(It's all thanks to Hsu Tae-lun.)

435
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,680
(All the Onmyoji Arena Pro League clubs)

436
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,920
(are now having their own forms of overhaul.)

437
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,000
(YQCB was the first to have the rule)

438
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,550
(that team players are not allowed
to go out alone after 10 p.m.)

439
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,160
(What's the difference
between this and staying in a prison?)

440
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,240
(Once the base door is closed for the night.)

441
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
(and everybody's got some exercise books
for college entrance exams,)

442
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,030
(we can easily)

443
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,750
(have people admitted to Tsinghua
or Peking University in a matter of minutes,)

444
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,640
(let alone win the Championship.)

445
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,350
(Actually, it's not just
a South Korean foreign aid issue,)

446
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,400
(it all comes down
to the person's character.)

447
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,920
(It's not like)

448
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
(everyone would sleep with their fans.)

449
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,200
(Isn't the midsolo Ai Jia in YQCB)

450
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,750
(a perfect example?)

451
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,790
(His girlfriend often shows up in the base.)

452
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,640
(And she is not a staff member there.)

453
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,160
(She looks nice, though.)

454
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,220
(- His girlfriend? Who is his girlfriend?)
(- It looks like she used to be his fan as well.)

455
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,960
(- Did you see the gossip post?)
(- Maybe she is dependent on Ai Jia.)

456
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,270
(It's all here.)

457
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,350
(Have you ever seen
YQCB midsolo Ai Jia's story?)

458
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,900
(Did he really sleep with his fans?)

459
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,940
(Just came across the e-sport player
Smiling, Aico and an unknown girl.)

460
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,500
(Looks pretty intimate.
Did she make herself his girlfriend from a booty call?)

461
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,300
(A beautiful young lady driving a Porsche,
spotted at YQCB's base gate.)

462
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,900
(Are current e-sport players so rich?)

463
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,310
Oh my God.

464
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,070
(Why is Jinyang involved in this?)

465
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,920
(He is definitely sleeping with his fans.)

466
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,310
(Good news, though, she looks good.)

467
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,480
(A girl with long legs, no wonder.)

468
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,590
(She is all Chanel.)

469
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,400
(Even the purse is a limited edition.)

470
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,720
How much does Ai Jia have to spend
on such a girlfriend?

471
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,310
(Ai Jia lives on soil and drinks tap water)

472
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,110
(just to be able to sustain
his jobless girlfriend.)

473
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,480
(What a poor man.)

474
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,590
(Jinyang, are you all right?)

475
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,880
(I became the victim of being misled.)

476
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,550
(You might be furious at seeing this,)

477
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,400
(but my suggestion is,)

478
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,720
(don't go to the E-sports Industry Farm
and bother yourself arguing with them.)

479
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,220
(Women are horrible.)

480
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,560
(Glad Cheng is still single.)

481
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,110
(Hope no other girls)

482
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,400
(would affect his professional status.)

483
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,140
(Everyone, please do me a favor)

484
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,380
(and stay away from him.)

485
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,070
(What should I do?)

486
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,510
(For the first time,
I feel like publicly announcing)

487
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,550
(my normal and pure relationship)

488
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,920
(is even harder than
winning the world championship.)

489
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,640
(Girl, as a professional e-sport player,)

490
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,880
(it's better to stay single
for the rest of your life,)

491
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,510
(or else your relationship)

492
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,310
(might make your family suffer.)

493
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,700
（YQCB_AICO）

494
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,200
Let me tell you all something.

495
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,640
You can eat whatever you want,

496
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,030
it's only death we are talking about here.

497
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
（YQCB_AICO)
But you can't say whatever comes to your mind.

498
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,830
That is going to

499
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,160
turn an innocent boy to a single man.

500
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,240
You are being haters you know?

501
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,480
All right, all right, stop bickering.

502
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,070
What's wrong with me having a girlfriend?

503
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,920
The keyboard that
I use is a present from my girlfriend.

504
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,480
I chased her as my girlfriend a long time ago

505
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,400
during the city match.

506
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I chased her.

507
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,920
I chased her.

508
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,270
Let me emphasize it

509
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,790
three times for the important things.

510
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,200
I chased her.

511
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,920
You have got tons of pictures already.

512
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,790
If any one of you has spotted
in one of those pictures

513
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,440
that there was a sense of admiration
for me in her eyes.

514
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,920
Let me know,
and I will sincerely say thank you.

515
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,920
What's wrong with me having a girlfriend?

516
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,960
We won't face relegation with or without her.

517
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,550
Who the heck is stirring this up?

518
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,400
Are you proud
that you don't have to face relegation?

519
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,070
What's the fuss all about?

520
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Aren't you ashamed
that your enemy team is also hearing this?

521
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,160
(No avoiding suspicion at all.)

522
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,830
(- This girl is literally taking the bull by the horns.)
(- I like it.)

523
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,310
Go.

524
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,440
(I want to sing a song for you.)

525
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,350
(Her legs are so long.)

526
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,120
(Ooh, ooh, ooh... Can you raise me, Ai Jia?)

527
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,420
(Why would a professional player
fall in love with anyone?)

528
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,820
(I want to sing a song for you.)

529
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,960
I know you are all very interested in me

530
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,240
and some have a particular problem with me.

531
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,270
I have also seen all the sincere blessings
under the comments area.

532
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,640
Here is my response.

533
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,640
RV's shoes are not fake.

534
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,240
It's me who took all the efforts of

535
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,960
carrying them back
from different exclusive shops.

536
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,830
Also,

537
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,920
stop digging at all the small gadgets.

538
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,110
Check this out.

539
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,110
This is the present my dear Ai Jia

540
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,270
sent to me during the last Double Eleven.

541
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,310
Happy?

542
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,510
Satisfied?

543
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,830
From today on,

544
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,680
no matter how hard the road ahead is,

545
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,270
I will never look back.

546
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
Take your time.

547
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,510
Don't listen to her.

548
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,510
Do you have any idea how much that car costs?

549
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
How could I afford that?

550
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,200
I.

551
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,270
I can't afford that. Not a chance.

552
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,510
Seriously, I am not lying.

553
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,350
Don't you know how much that car costs?

554
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,550
You can search on Baidu by yourself.

555
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,880
I, how can I afford that?

556
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,240
(Tong Yao)
(Others go around the gossip.)

557
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,640
(But you are not the same,)

558
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,400
(you go for it head-on)

559
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,920
(and dominate that gossip)

560
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,110
(by taking over their right of speech.)

561
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,310
(Taking the lead by yourself.)

562
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,790
(That's my amazing girl!)

563
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,310
(To Tong Yao)
(Please call me the Queen.)

564
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
(Lu Sicheng)
(Are you sleeping?)

565
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,270
- No.
- That's a present.

566
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
Let's go up.

567
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,750
(Lu Sicheng)
(Did you miss me?)

568
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,830
(To Lu Sicheng)
(Bro, five minutes ago.)

569
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,070
(We were sitting next to each other,
playing video games, all right?)

570
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,110
(I miss you so much.)

571
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,160
(Are you playing He Shuhuan?)
[*A man who claims to be loyal but struggles between two girls.]

572
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,030
(Or Hong Shixian?)
[*A man who cheated on his own wife with his wife's best friend.]

573
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,880
(I am playing Yongqi.)
[*Little Swallow's boyfriend in "My Fair Princess".]

574
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,160
(Little Swallow, are you thirsty?)

575
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
(Reply: I am good and not very thirsty.)

576
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
(But I am feeling a bit throwing up.)

577
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,550
I am going to
give a bottle of water to Tong Yao.

578
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,880
Strike him.

579
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,880
Wait, wait for me.

580
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,550
What is this?

581
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,480
I told them I was going to
get you some water.

582
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,750
You are quite smart.

583
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,200
Did you miss me?

584
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,160
What?

585
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,960
Now everyone knows that

586
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,920
the Onmyoji Arena Pro League clubs

587
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
are having major leadership reshuffles.

588
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,790
I heard that quite a few people

589
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,720
including those in the leadership of DQ.Five
had all been replaced.

590
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,030
Isn't that a good thing?

591
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
No, not at all.

592
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,510
It's gone too far.

593
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Even the normal relationship
between players is being regulated.

594
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,790
They said my friend Jinyang relies on Ai Jia

595
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,680
and that her showing up in the base every day

596
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,920
affects Ai Jia's training.

597
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,270
She is literally a coquette.

598
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,200
Doesn't your friend drive a Porsche?

599
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,920
How long would Ai Jia have to save his money

600
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
to afford that?

601
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,070
Well, they don't know.

602
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,880
Then why are you mad at me?

603
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,750
All right.

604
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,440
Look at this.

605
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,200
Women are horrible.

606
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,790
Glad Cheng is still single.

607
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,830
Hope no other girls

608
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,510
would affect his professional status.

609
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,550
Everyone, please do me a favor

610
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,720
and stay away from him.

611
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,510
You do know that fans' comments
don't represent their stars' opinions, don't you?

612
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,030
You are being unfair to me.

613
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,110
I know.

614
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,240
But,

615
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
maybe it suits you better to be a single man

616
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,510
who only knows how to play video games.

617
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,270
If you happen to fall in love with anyone,

618
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,920
you will no longer be the Mr. Right
for so many girls.

619
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,830
No.

620
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,880
Why not?

621
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,920
Why do I feel that it's so hard

622
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,350
to fall in love with you?

623
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
At worst, we don't announce it at all.

624
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,790
Isn't what we are right now good?

625
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,310
I am not going to push you.

626
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,440
Really?

627
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,240
Yeah.

628
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,880
After all, I broke the rule first.

629
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,510
I have been thinking about who you are,

630
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,550
you don't need this
even more than I don't need it.

631
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,680
But that doesn't mean I will regret.

632
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,640
If you have any complaints, throw them at me.

633
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,270
It's me who brought you in

634
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,350
and I will be responsible
for you till the end.

635
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,350
You are at most just an accomplice.

636
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,680
What makes me an accomplice?

637
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,030
You are too good at playing games.

638
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,240
And you are overly serious
about this profession, which is cute.

639
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,480
Such behaviors are very seductive to me.

640
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,400
What?

641
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Are you up to something dirty?

642
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,110
Wanna solo?

643
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,750
Solo the whole night?

644
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,110
What are you talking about?

645
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,880
Get out.

646
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,110
Tong Yao.

647
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,110
Out.

648
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,030
Good night.

649
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,230
What took you so long to send her some water?

650
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,840
She fell asleep after texting on WeChat.

651
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,190
And it took me half a day on the door
until she opened it.

652
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,800
How dare she

653
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,550
make our captain carry the water for her.

654
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,710
Exactly, God knows who spoiled her.

655
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,110
She is so daring.

Isn't she Smiling?

666
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,280
Are you Smiling?

667
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,710
This arena is so remote.

668
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,320
I really appreciate your efforts
to make it here.

669
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:08,800
No, it's fine.

670
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,280
Are you playing today, Tong Yao?

671
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,030
We are the second to play.

672
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,400
I am here to watch YQCB especially.

673
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,880
After all, they are our
most competitive opponents currently.

674
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,760
I just saw that

675
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,230
somebody put Cheng's light board

676
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,320
next to that of Hierophant.

677
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,510
That's a bit too much, huh?

678
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,880
I knew what you were doing
the moment I saw it.

679
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,110
Can I have your autograph?

680
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,000
Okay.

681
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,920
Great, thank you.

682
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,840
Well, can we take a picture together too?

683
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,030
Sure.

684
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,400
But when you post it,

685
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,550
remember to beautify me as well.

686
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,150
Okay.

687
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,880
Thanks.

688
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,000
Thanks.

689
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,670
Can I take a picture with you, Smiling?

690
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,510
Look.

691
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,280
- It looks so good.
- Here.

692
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,840
Thank you.

693
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,510
Why are you here?

694
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,670
To watch the game.

695
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,800
Why are you so serious now?

696
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,840
I have figured it out.

697
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,480
As long as Ai Jia is playing,

698
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,230
I will attend whenever I am available.

699
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
And I'll not just attend,

700
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,710
but also sit in the first row.

701
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,030
I need to let those misled people

702
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,960
see how long my legs are.

703
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,800
You can't get over with that, can you?

704
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,230
I can tolerate a while
for the sake of peace and love,

705
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
but the more I think about it,
the angrier I become.

706
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,440
Isn't she Ai Jia's girlfriend, Chen Jinyang?

707
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,880
How daring is she

708
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,110
to come at such an intense time?

709
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,480
Wouldn't she worry
that this might affect Ai Jia's performance?

710
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,840
Don't worry, I got you.

711
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,070
Shut up, you've got nothing.

712
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,590
It's you?

713
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Yes, it's me.

714
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,320
(ZGDX Smiling Fight)
Look.

715
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,070
What a surprise.

716
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,960
We had never imagined that

717
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,070
the famous Smiling

718
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,360
would be standing next to us,

719
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,070
and help us

720
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,710
diss the sexists that look down upon girls.

721
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,630
I was thinking at that time,

722
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,230
who is this brave girl,

723
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,510
and I'm almost becoming one of her fans.

724
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,230
Exactly, yeah.

725
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,190
We were all thinking,

726
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,280
and regretted that we didn't value the time

727
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,760
you were sitting next to us.

728
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
We didn't know the time for us
to make up for it would come so soon.

729
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,630
Yeah, yeah.

730
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,480
Smiling, here you go.

731
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,280
This time, it's free again.

732
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,110
We will always be there for you.

733
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,710
(ZGDX_GAMING)
(This physical sense that I can also have fans.)

734
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,150
(Ah, ah, ah.)

735
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,550
(You make me so full of myself.)

736
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,030
It will be the best if all of you can stay.

737
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,150
We decided to stay after meeting a player

738
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,480
that deserves to be pursued and loved.

739
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
You guys go on talking first.

740
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,360
We will keep distributing these in the back.

741
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

742
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,030
- Go, go, go.
- Bye.

743
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,110
What a scene, girl.

744
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,480
Let me tell you a joke.

745
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,960
You've got me.

746
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
The fans are making me feel so great.

747
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,670
Smiling like an idiot.

748
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,540
(ZGDX_GAMING)

749
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,860
(SMILING)

750
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,920
(I met fans in the front row.)

751
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,510
(There're so many of them)

752
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,800
(as well as my own personal fans as well.)

753
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,320
(Some girls who previously decided
to leave the industry of e-sports)

754
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,760
(got back because of me.)

755
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,760
(And they were wearing wrist bands
to support me.)

756
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,070
(I couldn't believe)

757
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,710
(they were actually coming back for me.)

758
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,920
(I took a pictures with them.)

759
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,440
(I saw it.)

760
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,590
(You're just saying that)

761
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,670
(I saw what you saw.)

762
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,510
(Raise your head.)

763
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,710
Here comes your husband.

764
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,840
He's worried about you and so has

765
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
made a special visit here to watch over you.

766
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,150
Sweet.

767
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,800
It's unlike that fool of mine,

768
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,550
who is now enjoying his time
with his teammates.

769
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,840
Look.

770
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,230
It's Cheng.

771
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,070
What a bargain to buy one ticket
and see another one for free.

772
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,670
Lu Sicheng.

773
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,840
He's so handsome.

774
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,510
We really earned it today.

775
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,550
(Why did you pretend not to see me when)

776
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,590
(I saw you and waved to you?)

777
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,590
(Are you blind?)

778
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,880
(Mind your language.)

779
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,380

I am going in.

781
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,230
