00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,030
Hello.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,830
Cheng, it's for you.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,920
Blind date?

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
I am Su Luo.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,830
Lu Yue,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,070
you seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
If this affects Cheng's performance,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,350
I will deduct your salary.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,560
Are you free this weekend? We can…

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,750
I will be competing over the weekend.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,390
Then I'll go to watch it.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,070
My brother is not back yet.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,470
It means that his blind date went well.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,110
We will soon have a sister-in-law.

(Jinyang)

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,430
Hey, Yao, what's up?

21
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,030
Jinyang,

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,360
our captain is going on a blind date today.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,190
Then why don't you stop him?

24
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,630
How could I stop him?

25
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,120
I heard the girl is a returnee
with a Masters in Finance,

26
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,800
1.72 meters tall,

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,590
whose family is business partner
with the captain's family.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,150
How can I compete with her?

29
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,960
Besides, why should I stop him?

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,590
What's the big deal about a master's degree?

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,400
Will Cheng care if she majors

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,030
in law or finance?

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,470
But I'll need bone extension surgery
to reach 1.72 meters tall,

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,470
or maybe God can bring me

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
Harry Potter who is good at magic.

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,560
I think you'd better

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,430
pray that Cheng has a unique taste

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,080
and prefers shorties.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,800
Why should I pray that he likes shorties?

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,590
Then why do you want to compare your height

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,190
against his blind date's?

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
I did not.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
I just want to gossip with you.

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,240
You are the one who started the comparison.

45
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,840
You know,

46
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,080
there are not so many people
like you in the world.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,680

and good at studying.

50
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,710
You're good at gaming, Mulan in E-sports.

51
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,030
You are also great!

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,960
Shut it.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,280
Sounds pretty unreliable, doesn't it?

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,870
It's so funny!

55
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,680
If you poke fun at me again,
you will not be my friend anymore.

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,710
Fine, fine.

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
By the way, it's raining in your area.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,310
When the sun comes out after the rain,

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,150
do your best to do some jumps.

60
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,870
Why?

61
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,150

can help you grow taller.

Don't be like this.

(both teams are ready to play.)

187
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,510
- Come on, let's start the BP part.
- We'll get to the…

188
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,670
- Wear headphones. Okay
- First part.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
(ZGDX)

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,790
(banned Kamaitachi, Yamakaze and Aoandou.)

191
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,270
I want to play Hannya in this round.

192
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Hannya in this version
is particularly strong.

193
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,790
Don't.

194
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,270
You dare to use it now
after only a few days of ranking matches?

195
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,320
I feel very insecure
with you acting like this.

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
Why? I want to play Hannya.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,960
Cat, no.

198
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,390
It's safer for you to choose Ibaraki Douji.

199
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,200
(ZGDX topsolo Cat chose)

200
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,440
(Ibaraki Douji which he is good at.)

201
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,750
Then what should I take, Ming?

202
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,750
Yasha is still available.

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,480
Maybe you take Yasha?
I think it's pretty good.

204
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,960
- K took Yasha.
- Okay.

205
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,790
If Yasha is selected,

206
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,630
then I can take a late-stage shikigami.

207
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,630
Dodomeki. Good for team fights.

208
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,440
OK.

209
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,390
How about our midsolo?

210
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,670
Offline?

211
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
So silent.

212
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,750
Tong Yao,

213
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
the opponent didn't ban Ootengu.

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,630
How about taking Ootengu this time?

215
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,270
(Tong Yao.)

216
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,630
Do you believe that some people,
even if they don't talk

217
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,750
or try to remain silent,

218
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,000
they will still get into the game quote?

219
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,480
- We'll be in the game soon.
- Go everyone!

220
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
- Good.
- Go for it!

221
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,580
(Onmyoji Arena)

222
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,260
(ZGDX vs. FNC)

223
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,700
(Onmyoji Arena)

224
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,750
(We now see that
Kun has hid himself in the grass first.)

225
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,440
(But he didn't go into
the grasses in the jungle,)

226
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,080
(but the grass beside the middle lane.)

227
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
(Interesting! Interesting!)

228
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,870
(Chen Yao, have you noticed?)

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
(This jungler Kun)

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
(didn't jungle at beginning,)

231
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,630
(but directly went to the middle lane.)

232
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,120
What's that? Have you seen it before?

233
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,120
I've never seen it before!

234
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,030
But I should point this out,

235
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,440
Kun's Mannendake

236
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,630
(can output pretty severe damage
in the earlier stage.)

237
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,150
(- Yes.
- With all his combos,)

238
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,150
(Smiling is now left with
only a third of her HP.)

239
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,720
(Both sides have reached level four now.)

240
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,510
(Looking at the current situation,)

241
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,440
Tong Yao can only level up under the turret.

242
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
Let's look at where Kun is.

243
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,790
Kun is still in the river on the middle lane.

244
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,440
(Go! Go!)

245
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,630
(Kun! Kun is there again! Seriously?)

246
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,000
(He forced Ootengu to use Flesh again
to escape back to the turret.)

247
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,440
(What's Kun doing?)

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,080
(When the opposite Susabi reaches level six,)

249
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,150
(he'll have the gold advantage
to solo kill Ootengu.)

250
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,510
Can she leave this time?

251
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,270
This way.

252
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,750
K from ZGDX

253
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
arrived just in time!

254
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,790
He saves Smiling at the last second.

255
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,960
Susabi had to back off

256
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
after getting hit with a set of combos.

257
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,910
- Yes, yes.
- Ootengu is safe for the time being.

258
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,840
(After clearing the line,)

259
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,910
(Ootengu should go back to recover.)

260
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,150
(Oh my gosh, she didn't go back
and has started confronting him!)

261
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,960
(She avoided Susabi's ultimate skill
and is now chasing him down!)

262
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,790
(A direct hit on Susabi
with only half of its HP left.)

263
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,720
Can he get away this time?

264
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
Tong Yao, don't persist in chasing.

265
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,440
(It's time for revenge!)

266
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,960
(Just now you hit me so hard,)

267
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,390
(now I'll kill you.)

268
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,000
(Oh my gosh,
Kun came out from the grass again,)

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,550
and directly killed Smiling.

270
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,600
(Defeat)
(Smiling was killed. Too bad.)

271
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,720
Your eyes cannot lie.

272
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,510
(What's wrong with Kun today?)

273
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,000
(Is he going to be dominating
the whole middle lane?)

274
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
(It's only been a few minutes
since the opening,)

275
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,510
and he already ambushed Smiling
several times!

276
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,670
It seems that today the midsolo
would have a hard time.

277
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,670
And if it goes on like this,

278
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,510
Smiling simply has no chance to develop.

279
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,360
Yes, yes.

280
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
What's wrong with Kun?

281
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,120
Did she offend the FNC's jungler?

282
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
What's this strategy?

283
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,440
I hope Tong Yao can hold on.

284
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,550
No, she may lose temper!

285
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,270
Shut up!

286
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,870
At present,

287
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,630
Kun came back to the bottom jungle of ZGDX.

288
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,080
Let's see whether Smiling

289
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,030
can get out of the turret with the line.

290
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,200
I'm a bit puzzled.

291
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,720
Doesn't Kun need to develop?

292
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,200
Is he giving up his own jungle?

293
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
He is either ambushing the midsolo,

294
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
or on his way to ambush the midsolo.

295
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,790
And look, there it is.

296
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,670
Kun has ambushed Smiling again.

297
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,740
(Knockout)

298
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,980
(Immune from control)

299
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,790
(Defeat)
Smiling is really having a hard time.

300
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,550
(Defeat)
I…

301
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,390
Are you done?

302
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,720
It's like the game map was cut in halves.

303
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,550
Only the middle lane is left.

304
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,390
He even ignores the jungle
and just ambushes me in the middle lane.

305
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,600
Don't get mad, Tong Yao.

306
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,030
There is still time. Take your time.

307
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,390
Tong Yao finally spoke up.

308
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,670
(Shocker.)

309
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,000
I thought she was possessed by someone.

310
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,790
Someone?

311
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,670
I'm not mute.

312
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,510
Tong Yao, stay under the turret

313
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,790
and level up carefully.

314
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,320
It seems that today Smiling
would be traumatized in the middle lane.

315
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,060
- We see that now she has chosen…
- Tong Yao.

316
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,320
- Under the tower
- I'm coming.

317
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,480
(My gosh, Kun went to the middle lane
to kill her despite the turret!)

318
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,870
(He doesn't care about the turret at all!)

319
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,080
(Rise to Prominence)
How come Tong Yao was run over herself?

320
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
(What's going on here?)

321
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,440
(He's killing her
despite getting himself killed.)

322
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,670
(I don't get it.)

323
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,440
Is he crazy?

324
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,080
He had no skills,
and took double moves over the tower.

325
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,910
Why is this jungler coming here
just to trade me out?

326
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,630
What the hell is this?

327
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,240
Why didn't we ban Mannendake just now?

328
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,390
If he dares to appear once again,
I will vomit in front of you!

329
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,240
Hold on, bro!

330
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,600
I can't calm down!

331
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,960
Hurry to destroy the nearest tower
and start team fights.

332
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,960
I don't want to play in this lane anymore.

333
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
The opponent is taking
the middle lane as a two-person lane.

334
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,510
I can't even get out of the turret.

335
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,630
What did I say?

336
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,200
I said she would lose temper, right?

337
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,200
It's all your fault.

338
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,480
Right.

339
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,480
It's my fault for not playing.

340
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,080
What a jinx.

341
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,200
You're the jinx.

342
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,150
- What a doomsayer!
- You…

343
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,910
Come on, FNC!

344
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,270
(Smiling uses her ultimate skill
to interrupt FNC's attack on the Orochi.)

345
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
(Kun from FNC also arrived in time.)

346
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,150
(Let's see if they can kill Orochi.)

347
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,200
Okay we now see this side,

348
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,720
they're in the middle of the team
fight over the Orochi.

349
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,980
(Defeat)
FNC players were killed one after another

350
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,870
by Chessman.

351
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,870
But Kun is completely ignoring Chessman

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,220
(Defeat)
Continue to hunt down Tong Yao

353
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,000
with an ultimate skill.

354
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,670
Smiling is killed!

355
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,550
No way, he chases me
even under such a situation?

356
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,600
Does he abandon the Orochi?

357
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,670
If that's how he's playing, I won't be able to
protect you with my shield even in three seconds.

358
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,270
I've already contributed to
half of the team's deaths.

359
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,120
(Perfect Power)
(Jungler K from ZGDX)

360
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,630
(catches up with the opponent's jungler Kun.)

361
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,320
(The Orochi is taken already.)

362
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,080
(The Demon Parade lane is coming out.)

363
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,080
(I'm so angry.)

364
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,680
- Don't be angry, we're going to win.
(- Is this game going to be…)

365
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,860
- Team fight.
(- finished like this?)

366
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,100
(Perfect Power)

367
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,000
The ZGDX team has now acquired

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,150
an advantageous line.

369
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,270
(Defeat)
They are going for the turret!

370
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,670
Attack the turret!

371
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,630
Any second now!

372
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,360
And that's the end of the game!

373
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,670
Yes!

374
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,240
Congratulations to the ZGDX team

375
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,030
for winning this round!

376
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,030
Congratulations!

377
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,480
Tong Yao, don't be sad.

378
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,150
I am now boiling with anger.

379
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,270
Anger, understand?

380
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,670
How long are you going to
sit there and meditate?

381
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,910
Come and discuss the next game.

382
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,240
Greetings.

383
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,150
Tong Yao,

384
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,000
can you say hello to my fans?

385
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,630
Hello everyone, this is Smiling from ZGDX.

386
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,910
(You guys are well matched.)

387
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,600
Tong Yao,

388
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,080
they say we're a good match.

389
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,790
Right?

390
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,270
Isn't she cute?

391
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,480
Bro,

392
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,200
what are you doing?

393
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,350
No live streaming here.

394
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,590
Can I add you on WeChat?

395
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,160
Add me on WeChat. Let's be friends.

396
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,030
I'll scan your QR code.

397
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,070
Thank you, Miss.

398
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,680
You're so cute.

399
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,270
What was that about?

400
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,590
You are collecting stamps again.

401
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,000
What do you mean?

402
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,000
He had already added all of us in WeChat.

403
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,350
Don't listen to Cheng.

404
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Tong Yao, come here.

405
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,400
Let's summarize

406
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,550
the problems in the last game,

407
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,400
so that we can strategize for the next game.

408
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
Okay, welcome back.

409
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,550
We are now half-way into the game.

410
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,790
It is fair to say Kun is having
a hard time in this game.

411
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,680
As soon as he goes to the bottom jungle,

412
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,830
(he would be chased by Chessman.)

413
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,030
(Defeat)
He had been killed three times already.

414
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
(Untargetable)
(Yes. Chessman is)

415
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,310
(- chasing Kun.)
(- Enemy's shikigami is sealed.)

416
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,720
(Defeat)
(It's as if he wants to dominate Kun.)

417
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,680
(On the contrary,)

418
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,480
Smiling is no longer getting ambushed
like in last round

419
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,920
(and is now roaming with Chessman.)

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,790
(It's like she's taking revenge on everyone.)

421
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,110
(Rise to Prominence)
Yes, yes.

422
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,200
(Let's now look at)

423
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,680
(the two top turrets)

424
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,790
(have already been destroyed.)

425
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,750
(Smiling keeps hanging around
the bottom lane.)

426
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,200
(- He keeps attacking.)
- Tong Yao, be careful.

427
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,640
(As for the jungler Kun on the other side,)

428
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,270
(he is not developing well this round.)

429
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,160
I'll go after Tong Yao.

430
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,030
Gold lagging aside,

431
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,270
he is getting chased after

432
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,830
no matter where he goes.

433
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,000
Is Cheng giving me up?

434
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,590
(Guard the tower,
guard the tower, guard the tower!)

435
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,060
(Legendary)

436
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,550
(Oh my gosh!)

437
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,400
(Chessman kills Kun in a matter of seconds!)

438
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,830
(He has)

439
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,110
avenged Smiling.

440
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,160
Chubby, follow me.

441
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,750
Coming.

442
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,880
K, do as we've practiced.

443
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,790
Copy that.

444
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,750
(This time it seems FNC)

445
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,880
(is forced into a team fight.)

446
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,580
Retreat, retreat.

447
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,160
(ZGDX is facing
a five-to-four confrontation this time!)

448
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,270
If they win this time,

449
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,920
(- and owns an advantageous line now…)
- Go! Go! Go!

450
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,550
It is fair to say
they could get the base turret here!

451
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,920
(They're fighting! They're fighting!)

452
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,720
- K, come in.
- Coming.

453
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
(Defeat)
ZGDX does this to protect the attack of the midsolo.

454
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,920
(to protect their midsolo.)

455
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,400
(Defeat)
(FNC's shooter got killed again.)

456
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,270
(They now only have)

457
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,200
(the midsolo Ootengu!)

458
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,780
(Double Kill)

459
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,400
(Their midsolo is also dead!)

460
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,000
Push!

461
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,750
(That's a team wipe! Oh my gosh!)

462
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,350
Come on, come on! Let's push! Push!

463
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,550
(If you don't leave now, you can't leave.)

464
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,720
(No one is guarding the base now!)

465
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,590
I've noticed this
after watching the two fights,

466
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
as long as the ZGDX team

467
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,030
(midsolo is doing well,)

468
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,200
(the opponent will not
have a chance at winning.)

469
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,240
(I don't think FNC can revive in time)

470
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,030
(to deal with the line.)

471
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,720
The line is already in their base,
would they have time?

472
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,350
(FNC has not resurrected!)

473
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,790
Destroy the base! Destroy the base!

474
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,880
Kill him! Kill him!

475
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,400
What is it?

476
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,830
Congratulations to the ZGDX team

477
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,720
for making it through the finalist!

478
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,200
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

479
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,790
You're good, Cheng!

480
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,750
I feel three years older

481
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,640
after finishing the match.

482
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,400
Let's go!

483
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,640
Let's go.

484
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,240
Let's go shake their hands.

485
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,510
Smiling,

486
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,790
nice to meet you.

487
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,030
You are very cute!

488
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,350
Go, go, go!

489
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,440
I'm cute too.

490
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,830
Are we going straight to dinner?

491
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm starving to death!

492
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,590
You're already hungry?

493
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,030
You ate the most at lunch.

494
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
He uses a lot of energy too.

495
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
By the way, aren't you hungry?

496
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,110
Cheng.

497
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,200
Cheng,

498
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
let's eat together!

499
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,720
Let's have a meal together. Together!

500
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,350
We've already…

501
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,750
Cheng, long time no see.

502
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,790
Let's have a meal together, shall we?

503
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,200
Is he always so enthusiastic?

504
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,790
I think your definition of
enthusiastic is wrong.

505
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,720
He is out of control.

506
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,830
Let's go!

507
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,030
Let's go. Get in.

508
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,920
Fine. We'll go.

509
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,270
Rui, where does Tong Yao sit?

510
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,030
Tong Yao!

511
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,440
What the hell?

512
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,110
How did he get in our car?

513
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Stamp collecting. Good job!

514
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,880
Chubby,

515
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,030
change your seat with me.

516
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,310
Where should I sit?

517
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,400
Lu Yue, how about you go to FNC's car?

518
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,400
No.

519
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,660
(Li Hengshuo: you played well today.
You are awesome.)

520
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,900
(I haven't seen many girls
who are good at games.)

521
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,880
What's up?

522
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
(Tired? Come out to play after dinner?)

523
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,060
(You ignore me. QWQ.)

524
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,270
I have an idea,

525
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,720
but I don't know if I should say it or not.

526
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,640
You shouldn't.

527
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,590
I think,

528
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,400
FNC's jungler wants to flirt with me.

529
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,310
You think so too?

530
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,510
Right now, I just want to
put him and Mannendake

531
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,750
into a coffin together.

532
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,480
Then nail it shut and bury it here
under the ground.

533
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,550
Bury them deep into the ground.

534
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,830
She's my girl. Don't bother her.

535
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,920
You little brat.

536
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,310
What do you mean?

537
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,880
What did he say?

538
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,240
What did you say?

539
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,000
He said he was sorry.

540
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,880
What did you say to him

541
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
to get him to apologize to me?

542
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Did you give him a scolding?

543
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,750
Translate it for me.

544
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,550
It doesn't matter now.

545
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
Anyway, from now on
he will not bother you anymore.

546
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,110
Cheng, I have something to ask you.

547
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,200
What?

548
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,960
Cheng, really?

549
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,270
The midsolo in your team

550
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,750
is really your girl?

551
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,830
How can you be so quick?!

552
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,400
I thought you are not this kind of person.

553
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,830
What kind of person am I?

554
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,790
Should I prove it to you?

555
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,270
Yeah, prove it.

556
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,240
Even if she's not my girl,
she will be someday.

557
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,480
Preparing to chase her is the same with

558
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,750
the fact that she is already my girlfriend.

559
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,030
Do you think you can flirt with her

560
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,920
just because I haven't gotten her?

561
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,270
Don't be angry with me, Cheng.

562
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,160
If you only want to protect your teammate,

563
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,310
this is not necessary at all.

564
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
I'll be nice to her as she's so cute.

565
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,550
I want to protect and love her.

566
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,160
Shut up, you little brat.

567
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,640
She is mine no matter how cute she is.

568
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,830
Don't think that
I don't know about all the girls

569
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
you've left broken-hearted in South Korea.

570
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
When we were drinking,

571
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,200
your brother Gun-hyeok

572
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,240
would always tell me
about the crap you've done.

573
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,200
You never date the same girl.

574
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,270
She is different. She is different.

575
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,240
If Tong Yao can be my girl,

576
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,270
I will tell the world
we're together right away.

577
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,880
I will even announce it on Instagram, OK?

578
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,030
By then, even my South Korean fans

579
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,920
will know about it.

580
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,590
If everyone supervises me,

581
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,880
what troubles will I make then?

582
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm now begging
as if you are my father-in-law.

583
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,550
Please!

584
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,480
You came here behind me.

585
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,640
Forget it.

586
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,880
Cheng,

587
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,270
don't you believe in love at first sight?

588
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,110
Her getting angry during the game

589
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,270
is so cute!

590
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,640
In later competitions,

591
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,350
I can let her kill me however she wants.

592
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,200
Cheng,

593
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,000
please agree to it.

594
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,960
I just like her like this.

595
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,350
It feels like I finally met

596
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,510
the girl of my life.

597
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,510
I will be good to her, really.

598
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,270
What should I do?

599
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,640
What should I do to let you believe that?

600
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,830
Or how about I go and beat up Tai?

601
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,350
I told you, she's my girl.

602
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,480
Cheers.

603
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,640
- I'm so happy.
- You are back.

604
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,680
It's so delicious!

605
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,000
Why did you two just come?

606
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,200
The meat is burnt.

607
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,110
Don't be having meetings now!

608
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,720
Eat up, the meat is cooked.

609
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,790
Well, it's all thanks to someone.

610
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,200
Cheng,

611
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,030
what did you do just now?

612
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,510
You didn't threaten him again, did you?

613
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,790
Why would I threaten him?

614
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,640
Are you nuts?

615
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
You are.

616
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,510
Cheng is usually not so fierce.

617
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,880
Eat more and be relaxed.

618
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,590
You're too talkative.

619
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,790
Get your own food.

620
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,240
Eat, eat, eat.

621
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,830
Good.

622
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,550
Come.

623
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,830
Why did you ask me to come here?

624
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,480
Well,

625
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,590
from now on this is our base.

626
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,200
What do you mean?

627
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,270
Ai Jia has been doing well lately.

628
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,680
I pulled him off the internship list.

629
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,640
He chased me all around

630
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,200
and told me his

631
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,590
life plan and so on.

632
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,550
I think it's quite reasonable,

633
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,350
so I decided to give him one more chance.

634
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,830
Since we decided to start over,

635
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,880
I didn't think it's appropriate
to stay at my grandmother's place.

636
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,590
So I found this place to stay.

637
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,310
So you and Ai Jia are back together?

638
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,110
Then you just rent
this five-star suite long term

639
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,640
that's just around our villa?

640
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,920
You really dare to spend.

641
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,160
It's all because of love.

642
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,350
Why don't you move in too?

643
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,270
No.

644
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,440
I still want to live in

645
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
the single room inside our villa.

646
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,790
I don't deserve

647
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,880
the happiness of rich people like you.

648
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,310
Why do you say that you don't deserve it?

649
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
Girl, you deserve it.

650
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,310
Not only that,

651
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,480
since I live closer to you,

652
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,240
I can give you support, right?

653
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,640
What support?

654
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,830
Oh right, I have something to ask you.

655
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,350
Come here.

656
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,790
Come.

657
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,480
Translate this for me!

658
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,640
What is this?

659
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,790
She's my girl. Don't bother her.

660
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,720
You little brat.

661
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,200
What the hell?

662
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,920
What do you mean, what the hell?

663
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,750
Translate it.

664
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,350
She is my girl.

665
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,440
Leave her alone, you little brat.

666
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,720
You sure are free these days.
Still have time to watch South Korean dramas.

667
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,240
No way!

668
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,350
It's not Cheng's voice, is it?

669
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,110
What's going on?

670
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,720
I told you that you need me very much.

671
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,350
Tell me about it.

672
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,340
(A voice message from Luo)

673
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,750
(I heard you will play a game on Sunday.)

674
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,000
(I bought a front row ticket to watch it.)

675
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,240
(So,)

676
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,240
(let's have dinner after the game.)

677
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,720
What's up with that girl?

678
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,440
Which girl?

679
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,460
(Luo)

680
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,160
Su Luo?

681
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,680
Isn't she your blind date?

682
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,200
Why is her contact in my phone?

683
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Well, she has a good impression of you.

684
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,000
You're good looking
and have a good personality.

685
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,070
Both of you have similar physique
and family background.

686
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,110
That's why you two match.

687
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,590
Our mom is also satisfied, right?

688
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,310
By the time I say it a third time,

689
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,270
you would be laying on the ground.

690
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,070
I'll give you one more chance.

691
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,510
Why is her contact in my phone?

692
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,110
Ms. Wang told me,

693
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,000
that day when you were on a blind date,

694
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,110
you said she did not match you.

695
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,640
But after the girl went home
and thought about it for a few days,

696
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,030
she still wanted to
try to add your WeChat.

697
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,110
Ms. Wang said you would never agree to that.

698
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,160
So she told me to...

699
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,070
Let me first explain.

700
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,270
I was threatened.

701
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,030
She said if I didn't do
what I was told and didn't do it,

702
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,440
I must go back to inherit
the family business for you.

703
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,160
And that I have to go on
a blind date, too.

704
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,310
(Cheng,)

705
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,880
(I've been thinking about it all night.)

706
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,510
(Although you said she was your…)

707
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,510
(I still don't believe it.)

708
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,590
(I'll go to watch your game this weekend.)

709
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,960
(If you are together)

710
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
(there would be signs, right?)

711
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,680
(If your midsolo is really your girlfriend,)

712
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
(then of course I'll quit.)

713
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,500
(If not, I'll do what I want.)

714
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,220
(Because I like her so much.)

715
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,200
(Do whatever you want.)

716
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,030
Boss, I really admire you.

717
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,440
That day in the car,

718
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,070
what did you say to him?

719
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,200
How could you block my potential date?

720
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,720
You've attracted numerous women

721
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,510
but is blocking others from dating me.

722
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,160
What date?

723
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,030
You heard it wrong.

724
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,790
Are you not explaining yourself?

725
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,030
My brother is avoiding the issue.

726
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,920
Between you,

727
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,440
something unspeakable has happened,

728
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:43,960
hasn't it?

729
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,110
You go back to practice your shikigami Shaku.

730
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,070
Why are you playing on my account again?!

731
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,640
Just having some fun.

732
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,830
Tong Yao, let's form
a three person party to play.

733
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,680
Move.

734
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,680
Let me play some more.

735
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,270
Is your own computer broken or something?

736
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,590
I got it.

737
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,240
You love my cat ear headset.

738
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,440
What? No.

739
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,070
You like my cat ear headset.

740
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,070
No, what is it? It's ugly.

741
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,160
I'll be going.

742
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,240
Come on, Cat.

743
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,960
K, come on, let's party up, hurry up!

744
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,350
I'm taking care of my skin.

745
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,590
Would you like to have one?

746
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,480
No need.

747
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
I have more.

748
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,640
You look like a coal digger.

749
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,680
Am I digging your coal?

750
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,590
What is the use of that?

751
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,920
Moisturizing.

752
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,160
Is that OK?

753
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,270
You guys are having a great season.

754
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Good record so far.

755
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,070
You will soon meet us.

756
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Yes, the deadline to defeat you

757
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
is counting down.

758
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,590
Cherish the time that
you can still dream now.

759
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,920
When the countdown ends,

760
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,320
your dream will be in pieces too.

761
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,710
I will make my dreams come true.

762
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,820
I heard that Kun has been...

763
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,630
He is very restless recently.

764
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,550
What is it?

765
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,590
I always feel that
there is someone watching me.

766
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,400
No one's there. Maybe a ghost?

767
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,190
Maybe it's really a ghost.

768
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,480
Goodbye.

769
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,440
Rest early. See you in the tournament.

770
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,920
(Good thing I was quick to hide.
I almost got caught there.)

771
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,320
You're up early!

772
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,070
Yes, I get up early sometimes.

773
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,190
What? Should I have informed you?

774
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,510
You should have.

775
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,150
I mean, you did tell others
that I am your girl.

776
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
I think you should let me know

777
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,110
what the color of your socks are too.

778
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,150
Black.

779
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Satisfied?

780
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,320
That's what I made for Biscuit.

781
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
I didn't expect she didn't like it.

782
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,440
It's a pity to throw it away.

783
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,030
Why don't you eat it?

784
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,630
OK.

785
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,020
(Stay calm and sensible, gank)

786
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,710
This game today,

787
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,280
Li Hengshuo will also come.

788
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,800
Who?

789
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,760
Kun.

790
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,070
Why could he come?

791
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,110
He is unwilling to give up!

792
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,710
He wants to see if we are really together.

793
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,960
If he finds out that's not true,

794
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,630
you will be his 18th lover.

795
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,230
18th?

796
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,590
But he looks like a good boy.

797
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,440
Like you said, he looks like one.

798
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,150
Back in South Korea,

799
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,840
he changes girlfriends more frequently
than he changes his clothes.

800
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,800
But because

801
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,550
he never takes fans as girlfriends

802
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,960
and his acting skills are first class,

803
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,710
so his fans haven't found out yet.

804
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,230
How do you know him so well?

805
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,440
Because long ago

806
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,000
when I was in the South Korean TAT team,

807
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,320
he was already an intern for the TAT team.

808
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,840
So it was not how the media said it to be,

809
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
that he joined after I left.

810
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,630
In other words, I am his senior.

811
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,880
And that's exactly why

812
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,030
he cannot flirt with the girl I'm dating.

813
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,440
That's what I said before.

814
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,280
Then before you make up
such a terrifying reason,

815
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,880
can't you inform me?

816
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,400
You have the guts of a kitten.

817
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,670
Would there be a point
in letting a scaredy-cat like you know?

818
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,920
If I had told you,
you would have come to grab the phone,

819
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,150
and he will keep flirting with you.

820
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,880
Finally you will become his 18th lover.

821
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,800
I know, I know, stop it.

822
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,030
The eggs are really well fried.

823
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
(Onmyoji Arena)

824
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,880
Your flowers.

825
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,510
Thank you.

826
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,190
Smiling.

827
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,230
Smiling.

828
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,070
Hello, everyone!

829
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,320
Welcome to the live broadcast of 2020

830
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,400
Onmyoji Arena Pro League!

831
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,320
The participants of this game

832
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,630
are ZGDX and LAN respectively.

833
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm sure everyone is interested

834
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,880
and looking forward to this game.

835
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,150
Look, such a big bouquet of roses.

836
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,440
Smiling.

837
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,550
Is that person your blind date, Cheng?

838
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,480
Sort of.

839
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,800
Do you see it? Do you see it?

840
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,920
Yeah, it's Cheng's hand.

841
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,550
Just like in the live streaming.

842
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,230
I knew something was between them.

843
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,070
I have long known they have something.

844
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,670
Really?

845
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,280
If you dare to make eyes with him again,

846
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
next time I'm afraid we will have to
French kiss in front of him

847
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,550
to dispel his thoughts.

848
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,800
I wasn't making eyes with him.

849
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,880
You think I'm blind?

850
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,190
I know. You let go of my head first.

851
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,030
No, he's still watching.

852
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,840
You two are whispering behind my back again.

853
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
The game is about to start.
Is it proper for you guys to do this?

854
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,510
Some people are too arrogant
and want to choose Mannendake.

855
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,320
I asked her
whether she wants to live anymore.

856
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,800
Forget what I said.

857
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,280
Cheng.

858
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,070
What?

859
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,880
If you do this,

860
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,030
wouldn't your blind date become jealous?

861
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,760
No.

862
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,030
I've rejected her.

863
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,800
But she says she didn't drop the idea yet

864
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,800
and would have a try.

865
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,630
She doesn't even know what e-sports is,

866
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,760
so what's the point in trying?

867
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,590
She is looking for a boyfriend, not a job.

868
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,190
Why must she know what e-sports is?

869
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,510
Because I am stubborn.

870
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,110
Okay, the game is about to begin!

871
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,440
Let's get into the BP part!

872
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,000
