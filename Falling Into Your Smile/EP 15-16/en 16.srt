1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,120
How are you all?

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,280
Tong Yao.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,790
Can you say hello

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,270
to my fans?

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,830
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,030
I'm Smiling from ZGDX.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,880
They say we're a good match.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
Cheng isn't usually this aggressive.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,830
Eat more. Don't be nervous.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,070
Get your own food.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,710
Watching her yell during the competition,

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,800
it's so cute!

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,520
If she shows up again, I'll throw up.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm now begging
as if you are my father-in-law.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,790
I'm begging you.

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,070
I told you.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,600
She's my girl.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,350
You've attracted so many
love affairs yourself

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,600
yet you're trying to keep my wooer away.

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,960
Is that person your blind date?

21
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,700
=Falling into Your Smile=

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,460
=Episode 16=

23
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,750
Hello, audience friends.

24
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,190
(Welcome to the live broadcast)

25
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,910
(of Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

26
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,120
(in 2020.)

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,520
(I'm the commentator for this game, Heng.)

28
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,280
(Hello, everyone!)

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,590
(I am the most handsome commentator, Shuo.)

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,400
(The matchups of the game are)

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,800
(ZGDX and LAN.)

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,400
(I believe you have been
looking forward to this match)

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,150
(for a long time.)

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,360
(Okay, viewers.)

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,630
What are you laughing at?

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,470
Today's game is interesting.

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,680
Explain it.

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,150
Cold-faced Lu Sicheng,

39
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,000
his hot date, Su Luo,

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,680
no, the average looking Su Luo,

41
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,430
and Shorty Smiling

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
as well as Kun, who has a crush on her

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,630
will all be on the same stage.

44
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,000
What is this?

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,630
It's a big battlefield.

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,430
Okay, K, keep up.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Here we go. I've got my ultimate skill
prepared. We can go for it.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Okay, let's do it.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
Chubby, save your ultimate skill
for Tong Yao.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
What's the situation?

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,190
There is something going on.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes!

53
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,150
Yes!

54
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,750
(It was)

55
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,120
(a great fight we just saw.)

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
(It was really good.)

57
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,400
(Yes, I'm still a bit excited.)

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,680
(ZGDX performed as expected.)

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,560
They were so resilient

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,030
just now.

61
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,400
They're really a top team
in the first tier.

62
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,120
(That's right.)

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
(But the only thing I feel sorry about is…)

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
Without Mannendake,

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,590
Tamamo-no-Mae carried the whole game.

66
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,310
That's true.

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,960
Our Tong Yao did a great job today.

68
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,870
Amazing.

69
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,630
Let's go, K.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Let's go.

71
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,870
What's wrong?

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,590
(How does the heroine usually handle it)

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,590
(when a woman like this
appears in a Korean drama?)

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,750
You dropped an eyelash here.

75
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,600
What's wrong?

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,360
Nothing. Nothing.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,870
Inexplicable.

78
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,870
Lu Sicheng.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm leaving.

80
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,720
Congratulations on your victory.

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,830
Thank you.

82
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,750
(Help! Help!)

83
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,390
(I suddenly and inexplicably)

84
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,680
(Sent to Amao's Mom)
(have evil and malicious thoughts)

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,310
(towards a person I have never met.)

86
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,240
(Amao's Mom)
(Welcome to the world of adults.)

87
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,870
(It was really a very strange action,)

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,240
(like a yellow dog)

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,000
(making a pee-pee on a telephone pole)

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,920
(that doesn't belong to it.)

91
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,680
(Silly girl, it's called biological stress.)

92
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,830
(By the way,)

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,950
(which telephone pole
did you pee on secretly?)

94
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,510
(The one at the entrance of Lu's village?)

95
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,190
Cheng, you've finally acknowledged me.

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,950
The packaging is of high quality
and so is the variety.

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
The person who sent flowers to the captain

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,870
is very discerning and sincere.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,950
Such a big bouquet
should be expensive, right?

100
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,270
Cheng.

101
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,040
That's a fan?

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,830
It's from his fiancée.

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,720
She's been promoted to fiancée?

104
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,240
What about our Tong Yao?

105
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,600
They've slept together and that's it?

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,830
What?

107
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,240
I hear the raindrops
falling on the green grass.

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I hear the cheating-bell
ringing in the distance.

109
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,430
I still can't hear your voice.

110
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,070
Seriously, say sorry.

111
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,630
Maybe I was too busy smiling and crying.

112
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,270
Too busy chasing...

113
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey, you guys, that's enough. Is that funny?

114
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,430
I mean, I was washing my hands
on the first floor of the base.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
I was wondering why the water was green.

116
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,480
It turned out that Tong Yao
was washing her hair on the second floor.

117
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,750
Get away.

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,870
- It's killing me.
- Are you guys done?

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,270
What fiancée?

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
You're making up your own drama.

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,390
It's all in the silence.

122
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,070
Cheng, what kind of calm expression is that?

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,310
Are you happy in your heart?

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,560
You've got a girlfriend
and you didn't tell us?

125
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Do you really regard us as teammates?

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,000
How can we trust you

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
anymore in the future games

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,070
if you're like this?

129
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,720
Right?

130
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,120
That's right.

131
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,310
I thought that Cheng
wouldn't fall in love with humans.

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,480
Spending all day with people like you,

133
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
how could I...

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
How are you?

135
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,360
Excuse me.

136
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
Why is he here again?

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,800
I don't know.

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,870
Tong Yao, eat this.

139
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,750
It's delicious.

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,920
I prepared all this for you.

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
It has energy.

142
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,870
It's good for your health.

143
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,830
Thank you. Thank you.

144
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,680
Eat it. It's delicious.

145
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,190
Eat a packet every day.

146
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,830
That way you'll think of me every day.

147
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,360
Thank you.

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,270
What's going on?

149
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,950
You come to our lounge repeatedly,

150
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,310
even making advances to my girl in public.

151
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,070
It's just a gift of food.

152
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,680
It's good for her health.

153
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,430
Cheng, you've never seen

154
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,160
the way I made advances in South Korea.

155
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,000
I could have plucked all the stars in the sky

156
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,840
and given them to her.

157
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,030
Tong Yao.

158
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,630
You're so cute.

159
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,360
Bye-bye.

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
What's going on?

161
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,000
He didn't ask us for our WeChat accounts

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,550
because he has all of ours.

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,910
Why are you the only one

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
who received mixed nuts?

165
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
I don't even have to think about it.

166
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,600
I've already made up a drama in my head.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,720
Time's up, you guys can…

168
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,030
What's the situation?

169
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,670
Flowers and snacks
were sent here one by one.

170
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,790
You only have a total of
ten minutes of rest time.

171
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,790
You plan to have a party?

172
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,000
You've really got nerve.

173
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,240
Our team's midsolo and shooter
are so charming.

174
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,910
Yeah, right.

175
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,080
You?

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Except me.

177
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,870
What's going on?

178
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,240
FNC's jungler from next door

179
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
is pursuing our Tong Yao.

180
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
He took the mixed nuts here as a bride price.

181
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Kun?

182
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,600
He is chasing after our Tong Yao?

183
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,720
He ambushed our midsolo like crazy

184
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,200
and killed her so many times.

185
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,270
And he thought he could marry…

186
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,960
(Dog?)

187
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,750
You professionals are

188
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,840
unusually romantic.

189
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,870
As a captain, I would like to advise you.

190
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,960
What?

191
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,510
Stay away from that Kun.

192
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,030
But the mixed nuts he gave me were delicious.

193
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,360
Who knocked over the jar of jealousy?

194
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,670
Why do I smell a hint of jealousy?

195
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
It’s killing me. The jealousy.

196
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
It's killing me! It's killing me!

197
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,080
All of you

198
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,960
are too concerned about others.

199
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,150
Let's go, let's go, it's time to go on.

200
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,910
Let's go, let's go.

201
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's go.

202
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,080
I hear the raindrops
falling on the green grass.

203
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,120
I hear the cheating-bell
ringing in the distance.

204
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
All right, all right.

205
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,750
Come on.

206
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,000
Stop it.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,870
Come on, come on.

208
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,750
We can take the fight.

209
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,390
Coming.

210
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,630
- Fight!
- Hold on.

211
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,600
Slow down a little bit.

212
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,390
Up! Up!

213
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,320
(Perfect Power)
Al right, this spot's great.

214
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
Keep a steady pace.

215
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,300
(God's Envoy)

216
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,560
(Double Kill)

217
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,520
(Legendary)

218
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,150
Yes. Nice!

219
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,440
Nice, huh?

220
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,910
Come on.

221
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,270
Chessman! Chessman! Chessman!

222
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,240
(Sent to Tong Yao)
Congratulations on winning the match.

223
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,750
Chessman! Chessman! Chessman!

224
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,440
Smiling!

225
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,870
What's going on?

226
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,840
You can even fall while walking,
do you lack calcium?

227
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,270
It was your support
who stepped on my shoes first.

228
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,480
What are you two doing in front of everyone?

229
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,600
Having a princess hug?

230
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,120
There is only a hug, no princess.

231
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you know how to grasp the essentials?

232
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,080
Put me down first.

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,270
Put me down.

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,000
(They're together.)

235
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,910
(They are definitely together.)

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,150
It's the first time I've seen

237
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,320
such a peculiar way of appearing as MVP.

238
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,910
I feel like I've been shown your love.

239
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
There must be something going on.

240
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,840
Congratulations to ZGDX

241
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,150
who defeated LAN with a score of 2:0

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,600
and won the game.

243
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
In regard to such a good result,

244
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,390
do you have anything to say, Smiling?

245
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,790
I'm satisfied.

246
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,910
Thanks to my teammates for allowing me
to win without putting in any effort.

247
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,030
I hope to continue this good state

248
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,440
up until the challenge game.

249
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,750
Smiling is so modest and straightforward.

250
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,720
Well, we all know that

251
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,440
Smiling

252
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,870
is the only girl

253
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,910
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

254
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,390
Then, we want to know,

255
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,750
do you have any difficulties in life,

256
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,080
and need to face more troubles

257
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
than ordinary players

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
as a girl who plays professionally?

259
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,460
(Tong Yao)

260
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,870
It's all right.

261
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,630
I was nervous at the beginning,

262
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,440
afraid that I wouldn't fit in
with everyone else.

263
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,720
Whether she can stay or not

264
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
depends on her performance in the first game.

265
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,510
(Then I found that everyone was very kind.)

266
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,390
Tong Yao.

267
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,390
Welcome to ZGDX.

268
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,270
Go for it!

269
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,790
Salute to the dreams.

270
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
Salute to the dreams.

271
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,000
Cheers! Cheers!

272
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,870
(No one seems to be taking
special care of me)

273
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,270
(because I'm a girl.)

274
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,960
Cheers.

275
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,510
(This is the best.)

276
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:47,790
Get out.

277
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,080
(Probably in their opinion,)

278
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,390
(a girl playing professionally)

279
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,270
(is not such a big deal.)

280
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,390
They've never thought of it in that way.

281
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,960
I know a lot of people

282
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,080
always think that
girls can't learn math well,

283
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,550
girls are not rational enough,

284
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,320
girls are killers on the road.

285
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,550
In every aspect of every field,

286
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,240
girls are always inferior to boys.

287
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,840
But I want to say

288
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,270
these are obvious prejudices.

289
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,960
If girls want to do

290
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,960
something well,

291
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,480
they can also do it well.

292
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,630
E-sports

293
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,870
shouldn't just be a field for boys.

294
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,240
I hope that people
who have such stubborn ideas

295
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,630
can be changed.

296
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,200
Cheng.

297
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,320
You've never publicly thanked me.

298
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,790
Not even a compliment.

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,030
As a support, I'm very upset.

300
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,600
It's just that we've never been
complimented in public.

301
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,870
Cheng once publicly praised Tong Yao.

302
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,390
But wait a minute.

303
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,390
We have a temporary additional
question today.

304
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,670
After thanking the audience,

305
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,240
when you were walking back,

306
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,630
what exactly happened

307
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,390
that made Chessman suddenly turn around

308
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,750
and pick you up in his arms?

309
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,670
To be honest,

310
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
it's rare to see such a romantic scene

311
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,480
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League field.

312
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,480
Chubby accidentally stepped on my shoe.

313
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,550
I tripped and fell.

314
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,000
Then he caught me.

315
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,150
But recently, all the gossip

316
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,320
is all about you and Cheng.

317
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,510
We're not in a relationship.

318
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,150
It's just that once in a while
he does something funny,

319
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,320
says some ambiguous things.

320
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,630
You must not be led along by him.

321
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,200
If our captain

322
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,320
decides to like humans one day

323
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
and then gets together with me,

324
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,510
I will definitely make the good news
known to the whole world.

325
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,270
Will you really tell us?

326
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll shout from the competition stage
with a loudspeaker.

327
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,720
Thank you very much for the interview.

328
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,320
That's the end of today's interview.

329
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,630
Thank you all.

330
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,360
Thank you.

331
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,120
Thank you.

332
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,240
Hello, everyone,

333
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm a reporter from
the E-sports Industry Farm.

334
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,030
ZGDX beat LAN by 2:0.

335
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
But that's not the point.

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,910
The point is that some fans have told me

337
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,270
that among the fans sitting in

338
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,910
the first row of ZGDX auditorium,

339
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,480
there was a girl
who was acting particularly strange.

340
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,630
She was obviously not
in the e-sports industry.

341
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,080
(E-sports industry farm)
When everyone was busy

342
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,590
taking pictures of Kun who was close by,

343
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,510
she inexplicably asked

344
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,000
who he was and why they were
taking pictures of him.

345
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,920
Also,

346
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,640
at the beginning of the first match,

347
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,480
there was big bouquet of flowers
placed next to her seat.

348
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,350
At the end of the first match,

349
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,160
she left the scene with the flowers.

350
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,680
And at the start of the second game,

351
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,830
she came back and the flowers were gone.

352
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
When someone asked her

353
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
whose fan she was,

354
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,310
she said she was a friend of Lu Sicheng.

355
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,550
And

356
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,310
according to the staff at the scene,

357
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,030
she saw a girl giving flowers to Lu Sicheng

358
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,830
backstage when passing by.

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,680
The two know each other for sure.

360
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,790
They talked for a while.

361
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,750
Later,

362
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,480
the girl seemed to

363
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,200
walk away, not so happy.

364
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,720
There is more exciting content.

365
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,880
Please pay attention to
the E-sports Industry Farm.

366
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,590
We'll see you tomorrow at the same time.

367
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,550
You're back?

368
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,750
Put them on.

369
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,160
Come on, put them on.

370
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,480
Where did you get these?

371
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,240
Cheng got them for you
at the hotel next door.

372
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,640
Is he so nice?

373
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,790
Put them on.

374
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,960
Let's go.

375
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,200
Aren't you taking the flowers?

376
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Cheng didn't say to take them.

377
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,510
They're still in bloom.

378
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,830
It's a pity to throw it away.

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,400
Let's go.

380
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,920
What are you doing?

381
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,070
It's so wasteful to
throw them away, isn't it?

382
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,920
You don't think it's a waste
to throw away Jian Yang's flowers?

383
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,960
Where are we going?

384
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,680
Cheng said he's gonna buy us shoes.

385
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,110
So handsome.

386
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,920
Look how tall they are.

387
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,240
How about this?

388
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,070
It's pretty good-looking.

389
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
We'll take it. Tell me your size.

390
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,510
43.

391
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,200
44.

392
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,070
41.

393
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,720
36.

394
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,960
What?

395
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,000
It's 36.

396
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,270
You can't fire me for that.

397
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,720
What's the big deal?

398
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,790
Nothing to brag about.

399
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,270
This is for men. The smallest size is 36.

400
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,960
I'll go see if there is a female version.

401
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,590
You're in luck.

402
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,830
There happens to be
one pair of them for girls.

403
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,880
Come on, try them on.

404
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,160
The shoes look beautiful on you.

405
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,510
And you match with the boys very well.

406
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,790
Just like couple's shoes.

407
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,830
Couple's shoes.

408
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,350
Then I'll choose a different kind.

409
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,200
No, otherwise it will be too late.

410
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,070
Do you have any sense of discipline?

411
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,590
That's it, we'll pay the bill.

412
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,270
This way.

413
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,110
I remember,

414
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,590
he is

415
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,440
the one from ZGDX.

416
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,400
Yes, yes, yes.

417
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,070
- He's so handsome.
- He's really handsome.

418
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,590
God, he's really handsome.

419
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,200
Yes, he is.

420
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Yes, let me show you a picture.

421
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,590
Look.

422
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,070
That's him in the photo.

423
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,960
- He's so handsome.
- That's true.

424
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,070
This is his girlfriend, right?

425
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes, she is.

426
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,510
She's so pretty.

427
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,400
Right? Both of them have long legs.

428
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,960
I'm so jealous.

429
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,750
They look so good together.
I like them so much.

430
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,720
I want a boyfriend like that too.

431
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,510
(The mysterious girlfriend
of the ZGDX's captain)

432
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,510
(I've sent some pictures of them hugging.)

433
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,960
(I told you guys not to spite Tong Yao
for her height.)

434
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,480
(Now it's all right, hey?)

435
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,070
(At least she knows how to play games.)

436
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,310
(I agree. I think it was on purpose too.)

437
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,350
(Cheng has been playing professionally
for a long time with few love affairs.)

438
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,400
(What the hell is this girl doing?)

439
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,310
I did not expect this girl

440
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,400
to make such a scene
just by sending some flowers.

441
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,110
These netizens, at such a time,

442
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,680
have turned into e-sports Sherlock Holmeses.

443
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,880
As for whether the girl
was intentional or not,

444
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,350
I think…

445
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,510
I should say she did do it on purpose

446
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,640
by means of my sixth sense.

447
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,000
Now I also think it was intentional.

448
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,790
It seems that the media department
will be working overtime tonight.

449
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,750
Who is it?

450
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,270
You said you had other plans.

451
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,240
You mean buying shoes?

452
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,960
Who is this?

453
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,920
So now that you're done shopping,

454
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,310
can you go to dinner with me now?

455
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,030
Who is that?

456
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm not available.

457
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,880
What are you doing?

458
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,350
I added you on WeChat for my brother,

459
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,720
just so that you could go make trouble?

460
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Did you know rumor
has all over the place now

461
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,510
that my brother is in love?

462
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
He even brought his girlfriend to the arena.

463
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,720
You even sent flowers.

464
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,070
What the hell?

465
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,200
So?

466
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
E-sports players are not supposed
to fall in love,

467
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,750
or what?

468
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,790
How old is he?

469
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,510
Can't he have a life of his own?

470
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,110
You did it on purpose?

471
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
So what if I did it on purpose?

472
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,510
Those female fans,

473
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,270
who do they all think they are?

474
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
How can they not be ashamed,
calling Cheng their husband?

475
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,680
I'll just make them forget
such ideas forever.

476
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,110
You must abide by the rules of an industry

477
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,750
if you're in it.

478
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,240
E-sports has become an industry?

479
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,350
You're arguing with me, are you?

480
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,110
Did you know

481
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,480
how much trouble
this has caused for our team,

482
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,920
for my brother?

483
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know what kind of nonsense
will appear in tomorrow's press.

484
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,480
If it's in the news, then just let it be.

485
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,000
It's good for increasing exposure for you.

486
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,030
Anyway, your family and our family

487
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,440
want us to fall in love and get married
as soon as possible.

488
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,750
(Luo has been added to the blacklist)

489
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,880
It's not that he can't fall in love.

490
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,750
It's that he can't
fall in love with people like you.

491
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,640
You…

492
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
Please delete my brother's WeChat.

493
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,720
Don't bother him anymore.

494
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,480
How's that your business?

495
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,350
Just try it and you will know.

496
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,510
You…

497
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't follow us anymore.

498
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,920
Wait for me.

499
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,960
What?

500
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,350
Jinyang said it's not good
to give shoes as a gift.

501
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,550
You have to give some money to
the shoe-receiver to ward off evil spirits.

502
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,920
Which village did you come from
to work in the city?

503
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,160
Can you even get access
to the Internet at home?

504
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,110
You don't know what's good for you.

505
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,310
Only lovers buy that kind of talk.

506
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,920
Then give it back to me.

507
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,440
You think I won't be able to find it
if you throw it in?

508
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,030
Take your time finding it.

509
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,480
Lu Sicheng, you're so childish.

510
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,590
(Cheng. Cheng.)

511
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,480
(Who was that girl today?)

512
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,200
That girl? Which girl?

513
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,830
How do you guys know everything?

514
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Sherlock Holmes?

515
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,880
She is no one.

516
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,960
She's the blind date my family
arranged for me.

517
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,550
(Why do you want to go on a blind date?)

518
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,030
What do you mean?

519
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm of legal marrying age.

520
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,310
And I'm an adult.

521
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,480
Why can't I go on a blind date?

522
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,160
It's okay. It's okay.

523
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,720
But I refused.

524
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,310
(Don't fall in love now.)

525
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,960
Yeah, right.

526
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,270
I don't want to think about it now.

527
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,110
I want to marry the trophy of world champion,

528
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,310
the kind with eight palanquins.

529
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,510
You rejected her,
yet you still gave her your WeChat.

530
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Deleted her long ago.

531
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,310
You could even hear that?

532
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,350
It's not whether she looks good or not,
whether suitable or not.

533
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,160
It's that I don't want anyone
not of this industry.

534
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,030
Sooner or later, we will break up.
It's a waste of time.

535
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,310
How wouldn't you break up?

536
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,550
Shorty.

537
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,790
Tell us your story.

538
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,110
Tell what?

539
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,510
I am still young I don't know anything.

540
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,960
I have already dedicated
my entire youth and girlish heart

541
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,350
to e-sports.

542
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,830
See?

543
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,750
If you want to know more details,

544
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,720
don't ask me, ask Jian Yang.

545
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,030
Yes, the one from CK.

546
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,000
And the one who just said she used to
think Smiling was short,

547
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,550
while thinking she's actually not bad now
by comparison,

548
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,680
and is someone who I can get along
all right with.

549
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,350
Chat-room manager, block her for a month.

550
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
The reason is she insulted my teammate
for being short.

551
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,880
What kind of girl do I like?

552
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,070
Didn't I tell you before?

553
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,590
One who play games better than me.

554
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,880
Do you hear that?

555
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,590
Our captain simply does not like humans.

556
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,790
You can rest assured.

557
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,200
Come on, Shorty, let's solo.

558
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,510
Solo?

559
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,440
Solo?

560
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,550
So exciting?

561
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,350
It really is.

562
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,270
It's not easy to

563
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,240
gather you all to stand by and watch.

564
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,030
Tonight,

565
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,310
ZGDX base will hold

566
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,000
a solo contest with midnight snacks
as the final prize.

567
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,750
The contestants are Tong Yao, Lu Sicheng.

568
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,640
All the people around,

569
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,720
please keep your mouths shut
while watching the competition.

570
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
Of course, the usual rules apply.

571
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,590
Whoever loses buys us midnight snacks.

572
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,400
Wait.

573
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,640
Why should I solo with him?

574
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,960
If you want to have a late-night snack,
you can let him buy it.

575
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,920
That's because our Cheng

576
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,550
wants to prove that in this world,

577
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,110
no girl is better at games than him.

578
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,240
So, girls, you can drop the idea.

579
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,960
Cat.

580
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,110
Are you stupid?

581
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,070
What's wrong?

582
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,310
Tong Yao.

583
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,310
Come on, we'll eat crayfish if you win.

584
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,200
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

585
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,440
Even if I don't play this solo,

586
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,960
I can also buy you guys snacks.

587
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,350
What kind of crayfish is that

588
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,550
if each of us can't eat
11 pounds of crayfish at once?

589
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,070
Yes, it's not enough.

590
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,510
I'll try to win.

591
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,160
Go for it. Go for it.

592
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,020
(Realm Raid Fight
Compare notes in room)

593
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,350
Why are you still on the air?

594
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,200
Do I have to buy the netizens' crayfish too?

595
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,640
I feel like I can see the scene of
Cheng's fighting match to recruit a wife.

596
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,550
The room is his ring.

597
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,640
(I also want to try. What if I win?)

598
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,350
I'll close the pop-ups
if you continue arguing like this.

599
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,440
Do you know the rules of solo combat?

600
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,640
I know. Whoever kills the enemy three times
and gets one turret wins.

601
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,590
Attention.

602
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,640
Cheng is going to start announcing

603
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,750
the rules of the match.

604
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,830
Can Tong Yao win the captain's heart?

605
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,070
I'm applying to join you.

606
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,310
Cheng, tell me about it.

607
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,350
Cheng has turned off the pop-ups
at the drop of a hat.

608
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,270
No one can express their feelings anymore.

609
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,400
How assertive.

610
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,240
Okay, our host, Chubby.

611
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,030
(Hello, everyone.)

612
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,680
(I'll introduce to you)

613
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,000
(the rules of the solo competition.)

614
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,200
(First, no yin-yang techniques are allowed.)

615
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,960
(Second, no spell skills like)

616
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,350
(Heal and Cleanse)
(That kind of skill)

617
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,070
(Third, fight in the middle lane.)

618
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
(The grass on both sides
of the middle is the boundary.)

619
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,400
(Going beyond the boundary
is considered a forfeit.)

620
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,160
(Fourth, the core rule.)

621
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,000
(Whoever kills the opponent three times)

622
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
(or destroys a turret will be the winner.)

623
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,200
For the sake of fairness,

624
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
neither side can use their best shikigamis.

625
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,240
Choose shikigamis for the same lane.

626
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,070
Okay, so warrior, assassin, support.

627
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Support?

628
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,680
Warrior.

629
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,030
All right, the solo competition begins now.

630
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,510
Let's go.

631
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,200
Go for it.

632
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,590
You can even miss the line under the turret?

633
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,350
Shut up.

634
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,550
Cheng has reached level 6 in advance.

635
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,720
Be careful, Tong Yao.

636
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
Tong Yao has also reached level 6.

637
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,200
But Cheng doesn't intend to

638
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,160
give her a chance to fight back.

639
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,030
Chubby.

640
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,200
You just did that on purpose, didn't you?

641
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,590
Is it so obvious?

642
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,660
(First Blood)

643
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,750
It's hard to fight like this

644
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,110
Three heads and a turret. Don't rush.

645
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,750
Come on, Tong Yao.

646
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,270
It's okay, let's not rush,
we'll take our time.

647
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,440
(Shield Disappeared)

648
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,550
Cheng, what are you doing?

649
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,550
What's wrong with your sudden madness?

650
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,510
There's a chance. Control him.

651
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,160
Chase him.

652
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,310
There's hope for the crayfish now.

653
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,060
(Ace)

654
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,830
The score is now tied at two to two.

655
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,830
Both of them have reached the full level
and are fully equipped.

656
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,000
So next,

657
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,160
will Tong Yao

658
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,880
get the captain's dog head in one fell swoop,

659
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,480
or…

660
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,350
his human head,

661
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,680
as a start to our joyful crayfish journey?

662
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,070
Or will the captain defeat Tong Yao

663
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,880
so as to verify the legend
that he doesn't love humans?

664
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,920
Let's wait and see.

665
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,590
As an old topsolo
who has played thousands of games,

666
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,350
I would like to say

667
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,680
a full-leveled Shuten Douji

668
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,510
is unable to beat
a full-leveled Ibaraki Douji.

669
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,720
It also depends on

670
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,070
who's playing.

671
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,110
Is that so?

672
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,270
Yes.

673
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,270
It's over.

674
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,160
I have to say...

675
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,350
Cheng's really cunning.

676
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,640
He earned enough damage and ran away.

677
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,750
I'm so mad.

678
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,270
Whether or not we can eat crayfish
all depends on this.

679
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,720
Shut up all of you, I'm dying.

680
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,310
Go, Tong Yao.

681
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,110
Go, Tong Yao. Go, Tong Yao.

682
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:23,710
Go, Tong Yao. Go, Tong Yao.

683
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,510
Tong Yao wins!

684
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:58,110
Crayfish! Crayfish! Crayfish!

685
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,030
I know, take your paw away.

686
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,800
The paw just kicked your ass.

687
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,840
Hello?

688
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,440
Let's meet

689
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,670
later.

690
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:14,590
Okay.

691
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,710
Who is it?

692
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,920
Su Luo.

693
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,840
She said she wanted to ask me out
one last time tonight.

694
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
After this, she won't bother me anymore.

695
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,400
You couldn't say no?

696
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,590
If I don't go, she'll come to the base.

697
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,440
Go, go, Cat.

698
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,360
Let's go to the gym.

699
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,920
We just went there this morning.

700
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,030
We'll eat so many crayfish
for the evening snacks.

701
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,590
We have to exercise a little earlier.

702
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,150
Otherwise, we'll gain
a lot of weight tomorrow.

703
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,630
Let's go.

704
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,710
That's right, I also have to go to exercise

705
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,360
in order to eat more crayfish tonight.

706
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,960
Call me when the crayfish arrives.

707
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm going to have a meeting with Ming.

708
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,110
I'm going.

709
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,230
You haven't gone to the gym once
in 800 years.

710
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,480
You told me to go to the gym?

711
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,360
Cheng.

712
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,230
Cheng.

713
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,900
(Smiling's source of happiness)

714
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
Listen to my song list and ignore me.

715
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,880
Are you not afraid of going deaf,
turning it up so loud?

716
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,630
