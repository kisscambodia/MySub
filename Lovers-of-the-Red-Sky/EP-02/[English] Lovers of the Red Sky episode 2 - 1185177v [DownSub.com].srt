Yes, Your Majesty.

22
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,850
However, we must first find the painter to restore the portrait.

23
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,770
We must find someone who can breathe divine powers into the paintings

24
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,130
and seal the demonic energy in it

25
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,150

My heart is pounding from just watching.

35
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,440
If your heart pounds upon seeing Cheoyonghwa, the Saehwa (TN: a painting that blesses the new year)

36
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,780
perhaps you should go to the doctor.

37
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,940
- Sir, you're here.
- I'm sorry, Sir.

38
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,150
<i>Go, hurry.</i>

39
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,080
Now. Today, I will teach you about

40
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,250
Sooseongnoindo, one of the Saehwas.

41
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,580
What is the most critical element of a Saehwa?

42
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,130
Is it not to finish the painting before the deadline?

43
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,390
No one will buy it if the right time passes.

44
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,680
<i>- That's the answer.</i>
<i>- That is true.</i>

45
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Finishing saehwa quickly isn't everything.

46
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,150
Observe the short height, the deer he is riding, and the jutted head.

47
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,490
Only copying these elements exactly

48
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,880
will effectively repel bad spirits and bring good fortune.

Choi Jeong, the painter of the Painting Bureau, showing in front of their eyes

51
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,410

52
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,060
Hey, Annoying One.

53
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,750
What use is replicating paintings exactly?

54
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,390
The most crucial element of a Saehwa is in the bold colors

55
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,340
and conveying the celebratory spirit.

56
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,970
In other words, we must paint the fortune, joy,

57
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,170
happiness, and beauty that people want to feel.

58
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,050

64
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,740
Uncle Chun Bok, here is the Cheoyonghwa.

65
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,810
I just need to go out front for a moment. I'll be right back.

66

Where is that grownup young lady running off to again at this hour?

67
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,510
Where is Cheon Gi going every night these days?

68
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,080
Wouldn't she be going to the market street to see painter Hong Eun Oh?

69
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,140
Chun Bok, do you know what?

70
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,800
- Cheon Gi has been looking after her father for— 
- Twenty years.

71
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,690
Yes, you have told me countless times.

72
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,180
- So you don't have to tell me— 
- She was completely blind

73
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,480
and only this tall,

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,870
but on the day it rained, she showed up with her sight restored.

75
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,710
She said she had to make a living for her father,

76
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,990
saying she would chop firewood or do the dishes.

77
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,630
She said she would do anything to learn painting.

78
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,290
Heaven was surely touched by filial devotion and restored her sight.

79
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,100
And what is more, she is undoubtedly Hong Eun Oh's daughter.

80
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,650
She learned painting so fast

81
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,010
and she painted so well.

82
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,040
How could I not look after her?

83
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,900
Look how handsome he is.

84
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,770
That is not all. He is also very gentle-mannered.

85
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,920
His Majesty the King favors him dearly.

86
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,050
His face glows.

87
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,860
What is going on? Why are they so excited?

88
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,220
Don't you know?

89
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,740
Warden Ha is on duty tonight.

90
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,320
Even as a man, I must admit

91
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,950
he is almost as handsome as me.

92
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,550
Even so, he is only a blind man.

93
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,710
- These women...
- Warden Jang, Sir.

94
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,170
I heard that Warden Ha was the Seokcheokdongja in the rain rite 19 years ago.

95
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,950
Yes.

96
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,170
Then, is it true that he turned blind that day?

97
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,990
Yes, certainly.

98
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,180
It rained for the first time in nine years that day.

99
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,060
So that is why he is called this palace's protector god.

100
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,130
Protector god my foot.

101
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,710
He is just the palace's water monster. A good-looking water monster.

102
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
Warden Ha is coming.

103
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,760
Warden Ha, welcome.

104
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,250
<i>Welcome.</i>

105
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,910
Let us begin the observation of hour of the tiger (3am to 5am).

106
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,700
We will start with observing the seven constellations of the southern sky.

107
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,210
Observe the seven constellations of the southern sky!

108
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,410
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

109
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,790
We shall begin the observation.

110
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,920
The fifth star of the sixth constellation is particularly bright.

111
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,810
<i>That signifies heading east will lead to an important person.</i>

112
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,840
Who are you?

113
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,310
You're here!

114
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,820
My buddies. Come in.

115
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,060
What took you so long?

116
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,140
This technique of painting the mountain tops like swirling clouds

117
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,820
and the technique of expressing the sharpness of the pine tree tips...

118
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,600
Could this be...

119
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,030
Park Yi's work?

120
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,030
Gosh, you do have a good eye.

121
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,920
As expected of Wolseongdang.

122
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,950
They only trade valuable paintings.

123
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,470
- What happens if it rips when I touch it...
- Hey, stop!

124
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,920
Don't you dare lay a finger on it.

125
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,280
It is worth the price of four tiled roof houses.

126
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,900
Four... four tiled roof houses?

127
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,780
It's finally finished!

128
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,570
Hey, come here.

129
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,020
How is it? Well?

130
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,190
Your skills are extraordinary as expected, Obnoxious One.

131
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,680
You've really done it.

132
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,190
It's as if Park Yi has reincarnated.

133
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,320
Long Face, what is the virtue of imitation?

134
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,030
First, bring the technique.

135
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,960
Second, bring the spirit of the original.

136
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Third, it has to be exactly the same, to put it simply.

137
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,720
I beg you...

138
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,580
don't be so arrogant, you obnoxious one.

139
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,760
Fine.

140
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,990
Even Grand Prince Yang Myeong, known for his exceptional painting skills,

141
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,170
would not suspect my imitation works.

142
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,560
I bet my precious white fox hair brush.

143
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,920
Aigoo, why would they build a shed here?

144
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,660
I would never come to a place like this.

145
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,120
Hey, hey, did you both hear about the owner of Wolseongdang?

146
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
<i>Il Wol Seong?</i>

147
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,070
<i>He is the richest man in Gwanyang.</i>

148
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,230
The best merchant in this country.

149
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,650
True, if he is rich enough to buy Park Yi's Sochundo.

150
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,780
Come on now. Not just Sochundo.

151
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,300
Remember how many original paintings were at Wolseongdang?

152
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,580
That is true.

153
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,050
And there is another very, extremely important secret.

154
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,770
<i>If you submit your question into the box in front of Wolseongdang,</i>

155
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,610
Il Wol Seong will return your message.

156
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,050
And says what? He will tell you what you want to know, so pay the price.

157
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,600
In other words, Il Wol Seong is an information central

158
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,900
who knows everything.

159
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,740
But you must be careful.

160
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,380
Among those who have dealt with Il Wol Seong, no one has seen his face.

161
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,270
He sits behind the draped curtain

162
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:04,010
and you can only hear his otherworldly voice.

163
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,820
Anyone who discovers his real identity...

164
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,100
will lose their heads, I hear.

165
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,850
You better watch that mouth of yours.

166
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,450
Do not believe everything he says.

167
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,670
Half of what he says is a bloated lie.

168
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,280
What? But you still believe half then?

169
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,790
I'm disinterested in the other half.

170
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,550
<i>Il Wol Seong...</i>

171
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,320
Hey, wait for me!

172
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,720
<i>Wolseongdang</i>

173
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,410
<i>Wolseongdang</i>

174
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,110
Yu Si Hong, the brother of Yeon Dynasty's emperor, is to come to this country as an envoy...

175
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,710
It is an important secret.

176
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,540
Is there a reason you are working at Janghwangjeong today, Sir?

177
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,770
The stars last night told me that an important person would visit me from the east.

178
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,430
The entryway of Janghwangjeong faces east.

179
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,700
Is there anyone you suspect?

180
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,550
Perhaps.

181
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,060
Who would be an important person to me?

182
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,260
Are you here? Mister Jeong.

183
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,090
Well, look who's here.

184
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,640
Painter Hong.

185
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,820
You should pay me first.

186
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,360
Let me see the new painting first.

187
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,590
It truly is difficult to decipher the fake from the original.

188
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,610
This is why I like you.

189
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,780
How should I say it? Shall I say you have no dignity as a painter?

190
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,790
It is exactly the same.

191
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,930
- Is that a compliment?
- The highest compliment.

192
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,730
Daubers usually paint fakes but still going crazy, trying to leave their mark somehow.

193
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,210
They are not even nobility, you know.

194
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,610
Even an imitation work is that painter's one and only piece.

195
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,920
Boy, I didn't know that.

196
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,490
Here it is.

197
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,270
Let me check.

198
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,810
Looks right.

199
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,870
What is this?

200
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,800
My last sign of respect?

201
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
Come now, stop acting like you're quitting.

202
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
I am.

203
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,760
I have enough money for my father's medicine now.

204
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,850
So this painting is my final imitation.

205
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,920
Do keep quiet about this as you promised.

206
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,690
Quitting, eh?

207
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,250
That's nice. Nice.

208
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,820
But Painter Hong.

209
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,370
It will not be easy quitting imitation now that you have gotten a taste of it.

210
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,160
It is like opium, shall I say?

211
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,620
Why are you being like this?

212
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,590
You know why.

213
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,910
Do you have to ask?

214
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,010
We act friendly and call you "Painter Hong"...

215
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,140
and now, you think you are all that.

216
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,930
Let's see.

217
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,550
I can't cut your hand off.

218
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,680
Are you threatening me?

219
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,170
- Have you forgotten who I am?
 - Of course not.

220
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,190
You are the only female painter in this town.

221
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,330
The only girl at Baegyu Painting Institute.

222
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,910
Would Wolseongdang's title as the most established painting institute remain

223
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,420
if you keep acting this way?

224
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,250
What?

225
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,510
Do you plan to strike me with this?

226
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,280
Go ahead.

227
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,750
Here is my hand.

228
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,850
You are fearless than an average man.

229
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,440
And you have better hearing than an average man.

230
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,670
<i>Hurry up and go back.</i>

231
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,930
Before I change my mind.

232
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,990
<i>Don't go back on your words.</i>

233
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,560
What are you doing?

234
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,900
Is someone there?

235
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,210
I told you to go. What are you doing?

236
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,040
<i>Don't speak nonsense and go back.</i>

237
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,620
All right.

238
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,280
I'm leaving.

239
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,480
Thank you for everything!

240
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,540
Same to you both.

241
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,340
Hyungnim.

242
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,600
Are you really going to let her go like this?

243
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,400
Hurry and prepare to go to Janghang.

244
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,580
<i>His Excellency Lee in Bukchon is waiting.</i>

245
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,570
<i>Make sure you don't mix up the real and the fake.</i>

246
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,650
My, I didn't know the color of medicine could be so beautiful.

247
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,930
Do you see?

248
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,170
This color is born from the ten-thousand-year-old turtle

249
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,100
whose shell is golden and neck is yellow.

250
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,380
This is a sacred medicine made from a 10,000-year-old golden turtle.

251
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,450
Unless it's the real heaven's medicine from a 10,000-year-old golden turtle,

252
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,800
you cannot have a color like this.

253
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,740
Yes, Sir. It is wonderful.

254
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,750
(In Chinese)

255
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,380
(In Chinese)

256
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,650
(In Chinese)

257
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,090
Even a single dose of this medicine

258
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,730
will have gradual effects from the day you take it.

259
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,070
Really?

260
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,300
That will do it! This will fix my father's illness.

261
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,640
(In Chinese)

262
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,130
No, no! There's no need to bargain.

263
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,570
It will bring bad luck.

264
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,120
No, no. I won't bargain. Fifty nyang. Fifty.

265
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,330
Come now, they say never take on a fight but always take on a bargain.

266
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,250
Gosh, no. To receive the spirit of a valuable medicine like this...

267
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,230
There. Here it is.

268
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,170
Fifty silver nyang.

269
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,060
You can check.

270
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,060
I will be going.

271
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,280
Thank you so much!

272
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,740
<i>Buy silk!</i>

273
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,700
Father, it's me, Cheon Gi.

274
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,360
Cheon Gi?

275
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,980
My Cheon Gi is only a baby.

276
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,680
Today's painting looks good.

277
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,260
Could you draw me?

278
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,490
Yes, miss.

279
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:17,260
<i>Ajeossi, you've only been making hoes, sickles, and plows since yesterday, right?</i>

280
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,910
<i>I hear sounds that are rounded and blunt like my hands.</i>

281
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,370
<i>Do you know how long I have been looking for you?</i>

282
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,840
<i>I did tell you, though.</i>

283
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,420
<i>Father, do you not remember again?</i>

284
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,190
<i>What?</i>

285
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,960
Whoa, what a beautiful painting.

286
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,480
All right, I shall pay you with this for the painting.

287
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,210
Say ah.

288
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,840
What are you doing?

289
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,190
I thought my Cheon Gi would be hungry, too.

290
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,310
I didn't even feed her breakfast properly.

291
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,710
I brought enough food. You can have it all.

292
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,770
Father, it is all for you.

293
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,380
And... this is something very precious.

294
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,750
What is...

295
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,310
Try this as well.

296
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,360
Savor the smell of this medicine first

297
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,860
then savor the taste.

298
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,750
You must eat it twice like that.

299
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,340
Here.

300
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,050
What is this?

301
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,850
<i>It is my everything.</i>

302
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,720
<i>I wish you would call me "My daughter, Hong Cheon Gi"</i>

303
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,250
<i>and hold my brush with me like before.</i>

304
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,870
<i>I wish you would scold me never to draw imitations again.</i>

305
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:48,040
<i>Scold me that it is no use painting without sincerity.</i>

306
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,050
That stench.

307
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,210
She didn't notice, did she?

308
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,840
She is quite quick-witted.

309
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,840
I made sure she didn't notice a thing.

310
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,340
Here, Sir.

311
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,700
- Let us go.
- Sir...

312
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,280
Please! Please give me back the house deed.

313
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,260
It's a house that has been passed down for three generations.

314
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,990
Who instigated the human sacrifice?

315
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,850
I acted alone, Your Majesty.

316
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,270
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.

317
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,490
It would not have rained had it not been for the human sacrifice.

318
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,690
There would have been more upheavals among the people

319
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,160
and the royal court would have been deeply distressed.

320
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,580
Is that not right, Your Majesty?

321
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,400
It did rain, so I shall spare your life.

322
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,100
You shall leave the palace as soon as dawn breaks.

323
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,740
And never return, even in death.

324
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,000
Your Majesty, I wish you good health.

325
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,540
The Grand Prince asks for you.

326
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,980
It seems only yesterday that you came to me after Father discarded you.

327
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,360
It has already been 20 years.

328
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,040
You haven't forgotten your oath, have you?

329
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,540
How could I?

330
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,680
I told you then it was not I who found you

331
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,650
but the heavens that chose you, Grand Prince.

332
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,100
Yes. When will that day come?

333
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,950
When you receive the spirit of Ma Wang,

334
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,490
the immortal ruler of death,

335
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,020
that will be your time.

336
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,800
I have heard that for years.

337
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,770
Compared to the gods, humans only live a short moment.

338
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,580
Time passes differently for them,

339
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,500
so please do not be anxious.

340
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,710
Isn't that a white crow?

341
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,700
It signifies a good fortune in a thousand years.

342
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,860
It was found dead in the mountain recently.

343
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,940
A big disaster will fall soon.

344
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,430
A big disaster...

345
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,310
<i>Father, will I really be able to see again?</i>

346
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,150
<i>Of course. Do not worry.</i>

347
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,930
<i>Om mani padme hum. Om mani padme hum.</i>

348
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,710
<i>Om...</i>

349
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,990
<i>It has been a while.</i>

350
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,940
<i>You...</i>

351
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,480
<i>Inquisitor Kim Gok Rae...</i>

352
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,440
<i>Inquisitor?</i>

353
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,110
Had you died that day at the cliff,

354
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,110
it would not have been so cumbersome.

355
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,630
Why are you doing this?

356
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,620
It has already been ten years since the abdicated King's orders.

357
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,650
Even after a hundred years, the King's orders are heaven's orders.

358
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,270
- <i>King's order?</i> 
 - I risked my life to seal Ma Wang!

359
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,170
My son lost his sight to bring the rain!

360
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,340
Is this how we are to be repaid?

361
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,160
Father!

362
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,380
<i>Mother!</i>

363
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,830
<i>Please don't do this!</i>

364
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,820
<i>- Father!
- Please, no!</i>

365
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,470
<i>Do you mean to leave me with my husband's corpse and take my son as well?</i>

366
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,870
It is the King's orders.

367
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,610
- Mother!
- Ha Ram!

368
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,210
Do you wish to die?

369
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,120
Mother, Mother... Mother!

370
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,910
<i>You killed three people that day.</i>

371
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,400
<i>I will get revenge for the bloodshed that day.</i>

372
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
<i>No matter what.</i>

373
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,770
You are late, Mu Yeong.

374
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,270
A message has arrived from the palace.

375
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,550
- Is it regarding the Crown Prince? 
- Yes, Sir.

376
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,910
The Crown Prince was attacked by an assassin

377
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,120
on his way to the hot springs.

378
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,390
Who was behind it?

379
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,590
We have dispatched agents from Wolseongdang.

380
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,720
We should hear back from them soon.

381
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,590
His Majesty has been unwell for a long time

382
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,460
and His Highness is weak.

383
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,800
It would have been a valuable opportunity to those who have their eye on the throne.

384
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,990
It seems...

385
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,250
An important guest will visit the commission box tonight.

386
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,000
Mu Yeong, go collect it for me.

387
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,610
Yes, Sir.

388
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,920
Bull's eye again, Your Excellency.

389
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,960
Did you hear His Highness was attacked by an assassin on his way to the hot springs?

390
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,510
Could it be a sign of a treasonous group threatening the throne?

391
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,440
I cannot sleep these days.

392
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,130
It is too early to be certain.

393
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,540
But if it concerns you so,

394
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,020
I advise you to meet Il Wol Seong.

395
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,250
- Il Wol Seong?
- Yes.

396
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,930
He is known to be as wise and all-knowing as Zhuge Liang.

397
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,230
Why have I not heard of this man until now?

398
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,770
Apologies, Your Excellency.

399
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:25,560
He acts so carefully and secretively that no one knows his face nor his voice yet—

400
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,930
I guess you are not lying?

401
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,580
No, Your Excellency.

402
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,910
How could I dare lie to you?

403
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,860
If what you say is true,

404
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,960
do you not think we should do everything

405
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
to get him on our side?

406
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,290
Where can I meet him?

407
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,980
<i>His commission box sits on market street.</i>

408
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,400
<i>Wolseongdang</i>

409
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,480
I am Mu Yeong of Wolseongdang.

410
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,690
I am here to collect the commission notes.

411
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,570
Take me to your master.

412
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,800
Be haste, for an important guest is here.

413
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,300
Apologies, but my master will not show his face to anyone.

414
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,740
Impertinence! How dare you! Watch your mouth.

415
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,650
But my master already knew Grand Prince would visit.

416
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,630
As long as you do not try to uncover his identity, you will receive the answer you desire—

417
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,630
You insolent—!

418
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,210
All right.

419
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,810
- Your Highness.
- At ease.

420
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,180
I understand...

421
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,490
Il Wol Seong's message.

422
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,790
<i>A week later, during the hour of swine(9pm~11pm) at Simcheonggak. Il Wol Seong.</i>

423
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,050
Il Wol Seong...

424
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,060
That's not it. I wanted a Cheoyonghwa for my front door.

425
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,480
What are you drawing? What is this?

426
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,520
You swindler!

427
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,270
<i>Hey, go over there.</i>

428
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,330
You're here.

429
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,020
Did you buy that ancient sacred golden medicine thing?

430
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,140
Yes, I did.

431
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,180
How are the results?

432
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,460
Can't you tell by her expression?

433
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,930
Look at that cold look in her eyes.

434
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,390
She definitely got beat up somewhere.

435
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:05,500
Hey! Did I not tell you that you should watch your mouth?

436
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,220
Give me this painting.

437
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,100
I cannot.

438
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,880
Come now. Don't be like that.

439
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,760
Give this to me.

440
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,690
No...

441
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,740
I'll give you enough for the painting!

442
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,950
So just give it...

443
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,240
- I said no. 
 - Give this to me, you scoundrel!

444
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,550
Granny, what are you doing?

445
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,000
Don't, it'll rip.

446
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,640
Give that to me.

447
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,570
Nice, isn't it?

448
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,090
Give that back.

449
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,280
You know, you will ride a palanquin soon.

450
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,930
I'm sorry?

451
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,450
Have no worry, my dear! It will be a flower palanquin!

452
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,630
Hey, granny!

453
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,600
Father.

454
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,500
It's me, Father.

455
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,050
Your daughter, Hong Cheon Gi.

456
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,780
Shall I paint you something?

457
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,880
Oh, no.

458
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,480
Don't stand in the rain. Come in.

459
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,710
Oh, no! My daughter!

460
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,620
Father!

461
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,660
You can't go. The shower will stop soon.

462
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,780
Let me go. My daughter is blind.

463
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,020
She's probably caught in the cold rain.

464
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,240
I'll go get her. Wait here.

465
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,160
All right. Then... she's about this tall.

466
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,060
- And she has a cane?
- Yes.

467
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,030
I got it.

468
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,330
Don't go anywhere. Sit and wait here.

469
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,700
I'll bring her back.

470
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,550
About Cheon Gi...

471
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,180
It doesn't sit well with me to fool a poor girl like that.

472
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,370
<i>Watch your mouth.</i>

473
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,470
<i>Our lives depend on it.</i>

474
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,790
We only have to pretend we don't know.

475
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,720
Gosh, look here.

476
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,970
Why did you have to fall into gambling?

477
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,810
Even if she finds out she bought fake medicine,

478
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:24,560
we cannot be the ones to tell her.

479
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,520
C-Cheon Gi...

480
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,080
What do you mean you fooled me?

481
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,380
What do you mean, Ajeossi?!

482
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,190
I'm so sorry, Cheon Gi.

483
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,810
What do you mean by that?

484
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,600
Sir, you're here!

485
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,630
Why did you drink so much?

486
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,290
Ja Ran, you pretty thing.

487
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,800
(In Chinese)

488
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,330
- You shameless prick.
- Oh, my gosh!

489
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,060
- S***!
- Hey, stop right there!

490
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,260
Hey! Stop right there!

491
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,290
<i>Goodness!</i>

492
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,600
- Hey! 
 - Hold on!

493
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,950
<i>Stop right there!</i>

494
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,660
Hey! You son of a whore!

495
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,020
- Hey!
- Move!

496
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,930
How could you! Only to earn that money for my father's medicine,

497
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,750
I was berated and worked without sleep or food!

498
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,650
You think you'll be able to live now?! Give back my money!

499
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,730
Stop right there!

500
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,970
My! That woman is quite something.

501
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,060
Stop right there, you prick!

502
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,770
You!

503
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,610
<i>What's going on?</i>

504
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,850
<i>Sounds like someone is being chased.</i>

505
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,830
Aigoo, Hyungnim!

506
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,460
It's good to run into you in a place like this.

507
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,990
Yes, Yul.

508
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,800
Are you having another poetry competition here?

509
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,360
Yes.

510
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,540
It is a pleasure to meet you. I'm Mae Hyang.

511
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,000
I hear you are the flower of Simcheonggak.

512
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,740
You are Grand Prince Ju Hyang, right?

513
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,090
I have heard a lot about you.

514
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,010
Come now, we can introduce ourselves later.

515
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,830
You are right on time.

516
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,440
Come and join us.

517
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,720
I declare we must do this another time.

518
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,630
I have an urgent engagement.

519
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,590
Well!

520
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,780
It is no fun...

521
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,220
to see you greet me so formally all the time.

522
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,640
How is it that you never change?

523
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,160
They say one dies when one changes suddenly.

524
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,720
Come on now.

525
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,660
There will be other nights.

526
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,880
You will soon host a painting gathering at Maejukheon.

527
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,340
We can drink the night away then.

528
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,770
Pardon?

529
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,430
You are really coming, Hyungnim?

530
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,130
Wow! This painting gathering will go down in history.

531
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,950
Well then, enjoy yourselves.

532
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,690
Have a good night, Hyungnim!

533
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,360
Are you Il Wol Seong?

534
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,790
Yes, Your Excellency.

535
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,360
Please have a seat.

536
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,900
I shall.

537
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,530
Have you looked over my question?

538
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,380
There was a very precious green jewel out of reach,

539
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,900
but a few nights ago, a guest <i>(humous way of calling a thief)</i> came and tried to steal it.

540
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,510
Was he a simple burglar blinded by the gleaming jewel

541
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,820
or a master thief who risked his life knowing the value of the jewel?

542
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:32,080
So, do you understand my concern?

543
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,970
A green jewel would mean a jade,

544
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,490
referring to your brother, the Crown Prince, Kang.

545
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,910
The unreachable place is the sky,

546
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,980
referring to the Crown Prince's Palace.

547
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,440
Thus?

548
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,400
If he were a simple burglar,

549
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,200
Your Excellency would not have become involved directly.

550
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,820
So it must have been a master thief.

551
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,170
Such a thief regards himself as high and almighty.

552
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:06,620
If someone like him reached for the unreachable sky,

553
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,880
that would signify treason.

554
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,160
What basis do you have to say such things?

555
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,220
I hear His Highness was ambushed by an assassin

556
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,760
on his way to the hot springs.

557
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,570
If this is not the sign of treason

558
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,110
referred to in the written question,

559
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,520
what else could it be?

560
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,460
You suggest...

561
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,240
the assassin incident is treason?

562
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,090
Do you truly wish to know?

563
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,380
- Speak!
 - Then...

564
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,320
instead of coming to me,

565
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,500
you should face yourself in the mirror.

566
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,000
It was Your Excellency...

567
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,330
who sent the assassin.

568
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,390
Do you wish to die by my sword?

569
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:26,570
If the one behind this plot were to be revealed,

570
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,530
you, who have tested me with this question,

571
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,860
would not be safe either, Grand Prince Juhyang.

572
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,170
You...

573
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,790
- You can't be...
 - Have you forgotten...

574
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,340
your oath...

575
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,290
not to seek my identity?

576
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,850
What swayed Zhuge Liang...

577
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,370
was not a sword.

578
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,350
I do not assume Your Excellency is impatient.

579
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:25,860
Seeing as you are protecting the current King.

580
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,170
When the time comes,

581
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,140
you shall see me again.

582
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,420
I tested you today.

583
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,250
Your wisdom and mettle.

584
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,430
Surely expected of Il Wol Seong, as they say.

585
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,380
I look forward to seeing you again.

586
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,650
Should I follow him?

587
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,670
No need.

588
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,720
He will not bend to a sword.

589
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,630
- Let's go.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

590
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,770
You! You swindler!

591
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,010
Give me back my money! I said, give me back my money!

592
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,810
How vicious! I don't know anything!

593
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,960
- Jeong Swen Ne told me to do it!
 - What?

594
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,170
Jeong Swen Ne?

595
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,050
Wolseongdang is behind this, too?

596
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,910
These scoundrels work in a pack!

597
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,960
I don't know anything!

598
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,260
Stop right there, you Wolseongdang scoundrel!

599
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,640
I did not mishear that, did I?

600
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:02,000
Yes, she definitely said, "Wolseongdang scoundrel!"

601
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,000
Tell Mu Yung to investigate what has been happening at Wolseongdang.

602
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,930
Yes, My Lord.

603
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,460
This way, that's right.

604
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,690
I made you wait too long, Go Pil.

605
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,480
It's nothing new.

606
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,110
The sun isn't even up yet.

607
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:23,370
Are you suggesting that I drown myself in drinks every night?

608
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,300
Perhaps you visit the courtesan house too often.

609
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,480
What else can I do? I am cautious of what the world thinks of me.

610
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,760
Cautious?

611
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,200
They say I have grown too powerful.

612
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,200
What power, Your Excellency?

613
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,220
The issue is that the people I gather with are all noblemen.

614
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,480
Do they think it is easy for a country's Grand Prince

615
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,580
to be this good-looking and to write calligraphy this well?

616
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,820
If it is only a misunderstanding stemming from

617
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,360
my good looks and love for literature and painting,

618
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,170
I am rather satisfied with this life, too.

619
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,240
Perhaps I misspoke.

620
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,760
No, repeat yourself again, Go Pil.

621
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,210
Start with what you said about my "good looks."

622
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,800
Good looks and...

623
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,960
<i>This is why I like you.</i>

624
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,150
Jeong Soin Ne...

625
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,880
Wolseongdang...

626
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,770
Hey, what are you doing?

627
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,840
Why do you look like that?

628
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,690
You must help me.

629
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,730
Gather around.

630
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,540
I'm going to...

631
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,830
All right. This is Mukjukdo <i>(ink wash painting of bamboo)</i> from Jong Dynasty's Woon Dong.

632
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,140
I hear this place is the best in art mounting and...

633
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,190
you know.

634
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,320
That you sell valuable paintings for a good price.

635
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,110
- So here I am today.
- You've come to the right place.

636
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,000
Wait!

637
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,570
It is worth more than a hundred silver nyang

638
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,980
so please do be careful with it.

639
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:11,840
<i>We will send a word once the painting sells so just relax and wait.</i>

640
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,310
Careful, careful!

641
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,920
Careful. To the left. Stop!

642
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,740
Anyone here?

643
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,620
What is it?

644
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,520
Someone reported that

645
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,820
you copy paintings entrusted to your care and sell them as originals.

646
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,220
Inspect the place!

647
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,790
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

648
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,170
Inspect what... What are you doing?

649
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,480
What are you doing?

650
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,950
Where did you hear such slander?

651
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,670
Where?

652
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:42,990
This isn't fake!

653
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,190
This is real!

654
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,280
Appraiser!

655
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,680
He is a painter of the Painting Bureau bestowed with the Eighth Junior Rank.

656
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,210
He will evaluate whether this painting is real or fake.

657
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,680
It is a fake.

658
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,250
What a load of bull!

659
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,190
This isn't fake!

660
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,320
A bug in Woon Dong's Mukjukdo?

661
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,670
- What?
- That is simply impossible.

662
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,980
The paper was bought from Moonseong Paper Goods across the street.

663
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,050
Look here.

664
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,130
It is marked with the store's emblem.

665
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,650
It can't be!

666
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,810
I can't be!

667
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,680
- Arrest him!
<i>- Yes, Sir!</i>

668
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,170
This isn't fair!

669
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,380
This is slander!

670
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,990
I know nothing of this!

671
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,870
I would never do such a thing!

672
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,120
It is nothing!

673
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,120
I am only going to talk with them!

674
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,520
It is nothing!

675
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,210
♫ <i>Hey Ya Jihwaja, all is well</i> ♫

676
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,000
♫ <i>Hey Ya Jihwaja</i> ♫

677
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,970
♫ <i>Hey Ya Jihwaja, all is well</i> ♫

678
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,000
♫ <i>Eh Heh Heh Jihwaja</i> ♫

679
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,600
♫ <i>Hurrah!</i> ♫

680
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,680
I'm only going to talk with them!

681
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,080
<i>- What's going on?
- Look what's happened.</i>

682
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,860
Hong Cheon Gi, this is your doing, wench!

683
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,340
Are you out of your mind?

684
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,740
You just wait!

685
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,310
You worthless little s***!

686
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:34,220
I will get you!

687
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,070
Gosh, I feel as if a dead weight had been lifted.

688
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,140
Is that enough?

689
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,670
Now you can face off any rascals.

690
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,020
Have you looked into the incident at the courtesan house?

691
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:20,300
The deputy leader, Jeong Swen Ne, has been making money illegally by selling imitation paintings.

692
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,510
When the painter who helped with imitation paintings tried to quit,

693
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:26,330
he tricked the painter and took her money.

694
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,060
- And he got caught. 
 - Yes.

695
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,110
Jeong Swen Ne was taken to the Police Bureau today.

696
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,400
- Jeong Swen Ne was taken to the Police Bureau today. 
 - The Police Bureau?

697
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:33,380
The Police Bureau?

698
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,600
He tricked the imitation artist, and that was the cause for his trouble.

699
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,560
You mean he was arrested because of the painter?

700
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,410
Yes, Sir.

701
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,840
Close Wolseongdang... and find the imitation artist and get more details.

702
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,810
Sir, it is time to go to court.

703
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:10,220
The Crown Prince would not have been shot with an arrow had this not been treason.

704
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:15,580
I do not understand how all the guards were not able to catch that one person.

705
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,570
Among the 5 northern stars of Jamiwon <i>(the celestial abode of the Jade Emperor)</i> representing the palace,

706
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,670
the Crown Prince's star shines big and luminous.

707
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,740
I believe there is no need to worry for His Highness' safety.

708
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,200
Is that so?

709
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:35,280
But should we not find what group is threatening the royal family and punish them accordingly?

710
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,310
I have heard that the blood shed by a king

711
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,110
follows his descendants for a thousand years, even after his death.

712
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:46,610
Your Majesty is still uneasy about the blood shed by the previous King.

713
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,930
You must be firm at times like these.

714
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,690
Yes.

715
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,230
That is what I must do.

716
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,930
Come closer.

717
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,970
From now on, among the 5 northern stars,

718
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:16,110
observe the second and third stars carefully that represent Juhyang and Yangmyeong.

719
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,190
that represent Juhyang and Yangmyeong.

720
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,120
It is a secret order that I hand down to you.

721
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,370
I shall obey your order, Your Majesty.

722
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:29,520
Do you still not have memories of the past?

723
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,730
No, Your Majesty.

724
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:36,780
The memories following the rain rite 19 years ago have yet to come to me.

725
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:44,500
But... there are times when fragments of memories come to me.

726
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:50,670
I am glad to know that there are improvements.

727
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,260
Yes.

728
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,290
It is a relief.

729
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,370
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

730
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,760
<i>I say that I have forgotten the events of that day.</i>

731
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,150
<i>But how could I forget everything?</i>

732
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,060
<i>Until those who killed my father,</i>

733
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,160
<i>brought down my family and ruined my life</i>

734
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,960
<i>pay for their sins,</i>

735
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,350
<i>I can never forget... nor stop.</i>

736
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:32,130
<i>nor stop.</i>

737
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,420
- Did you do it?
- I did.

738
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,890
Hyungnim!

739
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,330
What took you so long?

740
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:44,220
They asked for three times the money.

741
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,900
They stuffed triple the money and treated me like this?

742
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,500
- They said we should be thankful they let you go...
- Geez!

743
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,910
Hong Cheon Gi. Where is that wench?

744
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,470
You got what you deserve, Jeong Swen Ne.

745
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,440
Evil scoundrel.

746
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:09,630
Revenge doesn't give me my money back, though.

747
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,740
<i>Everything that has happened to you is not within the human will.</i>

748
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,520
<i>It isn't your fault!</i>

749
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,020
Somehow, those words...

750
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,950
still bring me comfort.

751
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,510
All right.

752
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,260
Hey, Annoying One.

753
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,910
Why? What is it this time?

754
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:40,130
<i>I've been swindled 50 nyang by Wolseongdang's Jeong Swen Ne.</i>

755
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,990
<i>As his master, Il Wol Seong must give me 100 nyang in return.</i>

756
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:49,760
Caught you. Painter Hong, you're so busy running around all over these days.

757
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,250
Why are you doing this?

758
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,480
Why?

759
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,650
I was supposed to rot in jail but I got out early.

760
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,600
A 100 nyang?

761
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,410
You shrewd wench.

762
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,960
- Hey!
- S***! Catch her!

763
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,670
<i>Hyungnim!  Hyungnim! </i>

764
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,250
Where did she go?

765
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,350
- Get in there!
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

766
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,530
That sneaky wench!

767
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,850
Warden, we're at the town entrance.

768
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,640
I shall show the guards the night pass.

769
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,610
All right.

770
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,810
<i>What? Jeong Swen Ne?</i>

771
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,950
<i>Wolseongdang is behind this, too?</i>

772
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,930
How did I...

773
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,430
I don't know who you are, but please pretend you didn't see me!

774
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,790
- Who are you?
- Hush! Please be quiet!

775
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,240
<i>Did we lose her?</i>

776
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,000
It is past curfew, so she couldn't have gone beyond the walls.

777
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,110
<i>- Find her!
- Yes, Hyungnim!</i>

778
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,880
Wait until I catch you, you wench.

779
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,990
I'll break your wrist and make sure you never paint again.

780
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:00,080
<i>This woman, could she be?</i>

781
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,010
Who are you?

782
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,370
Let me ask you something. Have you seen a girl on the run?

783
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,740
Have you seen a girl on the run?

784
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,310
A girl?

785
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,430
May I look inside the palanquin?

786
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,700
- Let's go, Man Soo. 
 - <i>Yes, Sir.</i>

787
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,750
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

788
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,380
<i>- Go!
- All right! One, two...</i>

789
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,070
Wait!

790
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,460
What is the meaning of this?

791
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,290
I need to see the face of the rider.

792
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,030
<i>Do you know who this is?</i>

793
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,080
What is going on outside?

794
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,860
<i>Sir, it is nothing.</i>

795
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,580
- You should go...
- Sir.

796
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,390
I don't know who you are but I am looking for a maid who ran away from me.

797
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,710
but I am looking for a maidservant who ran away.

798
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,450
<i>She definitely ran off this way. I have looked everywhere...</i>

799
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,750
<i>I have looked everywhere...</i>

800
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,280
I am the only one in the palanquin.

801
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,880
I cannot let you leave before I see with my own eyes.

802
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,490
Wait...

803
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,810
Open it if you dare.

804
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,650
<i>Red eyes?</i>

805
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:07,650
This palanquin was given to me by His Majesty himself.

806
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,350
Do you understand what that means?

807
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:19,860
I have been disrespectful. I should have been more careful.

808
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,260
Consider yourself lucky.

809
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,970
Had you opened the door, you would have lost your life.

810
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,220
you would have lost your life.

811
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,470
Let's go, Man Soo.

812
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,540
<i>Move!</i>

813
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,420
Hurry along.

814
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,970
<i>Thank you.</i>

815
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,510
<i>You saved my life.</i>

816
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,590
<i>Did I surprise you?</i>

817
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,750
<i>I was scared to death.</i>

818
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,080
I was also surprised it was not a woman

819
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,560
but a man in the palanquin.

820
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,980
I only ride the palanquin because I can't see.

821
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,660
I'm sorry?

822
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,420
I see.

823
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,380
But why did you help me?

824
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,460
What if I really am a runaway maidservant?

825
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,840
I smell a strong scent of ink from you,

826
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,170
so I knew you could not be a maidservant.

827
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,950
A maidservant would not have dared to hide in a stranger's palanquin.

828
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:35,010
I thought you had a reason.

829
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:40,150
That is right! I'm a painter.

830
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,870
That is remarkable.

831
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,340
It is nothing.

832
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:47,390
Because I can't see, I inspect my surroundings with sounds and scents.

833
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,450
Were you waiting for someone, by chance?

834
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,000
It is quite late at night.

835
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,820
Actually, I was being chased by them from the beginning.

836
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:01,090
What is your reason for being in such a distressful situation?

837
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,800
I was swindled by that jerk.

838
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,980
He is just dreadful.

839
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,540
Have you heard of Wolseongdang at Woonjongga <i>(main market street)</i>?

840
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,610
I am not sure.

841
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:17,090
It is a gallery famous for selling valuable and expensive paintings.

842
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,080
But in truth, they are a despicable swindling bunch

843
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,580
that sell imitation works as originals.

844
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,450
That scoundrel swindled me and stole my money

845
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,390
and I certainly repaid him.

846
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,570
I even saw him being taken to the Police Bureau.

847
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,970
I didn't think he would be out so quickly.

848
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,430
Oh, right!

849
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,830
Il Wol Seong, that man must have helped him!

850
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,010
I hear he is a dangerous man.

851
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,990
- Il Wol Seong?
- Yes.

852
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,280
He is the worst and most dangerous man.

853
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,500
Anyone who discovers his real identity

854
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,100
will lose their neck.

855
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:52,650
I have heard of his name before.

856
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,280
- But I hear he is virtuous and well-educated...
- What?

857
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,360
Why are you speaking like a thunderstruck date on a lightening day?

858
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,990
Gosh, you have it all wrong!

859
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,930
Could you...

860
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,060
by any chance...

861
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:18,010
be Il Wol Seong's acquaintance?

862
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,370
- Of course not.
- Thank goodness.

863
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:24,400
Why would you jest about such a thing? You really startled me.

864
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,440
<i>Here it is.</i>

865
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,380
<i>Thank goodness. Why would you jest about such a thing?</i>

866
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,990
<i>You really startled me.</i>

867
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:35,380
<i>Why am I reminded of her?</i>

868
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,290
- The road is becoming rough!
- Yes.

869
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:55,310
Your eyes are really beautiful.

870
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:59,020
They are like red, red jaspers.

871
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,220
Are you all right?

872
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,000
Yes, I'm all right.

873
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,330
No one has ever said that to me before.

874
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:21,050
People call me water demon when they see my eyes.

875
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,030
To eyes this beautiful?

876
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,940
They are the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

877
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,800
I mean it.

878
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,580
Are you all right? The palanquin is...

879
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,020
Sir?

880
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,870
What is wrong?

881
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,820
Are you unwell?

882
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,380
- I think you should get off now.
- Pardon?

883
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,670
So suddenly?

884
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:29,070
Man Soo, stop the palanquin.

885
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,570
Pardon?

886
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,950
<i>Yes, Warden Sir.</i>

887
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,890
<i>- Stop the palanquin.</i>
- Sir?

888
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,450
Sir, at least tell me your name.

889
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,330
Hurry, Man Soo.

890
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:55,240
Ye... yes, Warden Sir.

891
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,060
<i>Warden?</i>

892
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,410
Be careful on your way home.

893
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,610
Let's go.

894
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,000
Wait, Sir! Your name!

895
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,120
Sir...

896
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,350
Will she be all right alone at night?

897
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:27,100
The town is just ahead, but...

898
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,830
Sir?

899
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,770
I mean, how could he just tell me to get off so suddenly?

900
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,880
I wonder how Annoying One and Long Face are doing.

901
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,850
What's wrong with these people...

902
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,570
Hold on tightly.

903
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:03,110
The road is rough here.

904
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,720
The palanquin keeps shaking!

905
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,270
No, wait.

906
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,080
It's shaking too much.

907
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,980
Hold on!

908
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,840
Put down the palanquin!

909
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,110
What are you doing?

910
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,800
Sir, are you all right?

911
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,210
Sir?

912
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:59,160
What is that?

913
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:05,140
- What is it? A tiger?
- No!

914
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,050
It's the water demon! A water demon!

915
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,550
Sir!

916
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,030
He's not here.

917
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,730
Run!

918
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,950

929
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:58,700
<i>He dropped straight from the sky and just fainted.</i>

930
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,660
<i>What do you mean all the guards died last night?</i>

931
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,190

932
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,920
<i>It is surely the sign of Ma Wang.</i>

933
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,930

934
