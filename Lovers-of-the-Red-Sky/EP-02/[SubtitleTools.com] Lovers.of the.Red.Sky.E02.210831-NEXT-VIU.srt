00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:40,021
(This drama is fictional and people or stories are not tied to reality.)

2
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:57,038
Due to the Demon's temptation,

3
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,508
so many people had to shed their blood.

4
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:07,478
I gained more power as the king,

5
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:11,217
but karma was always there to haunt me.

6
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:18,988
I will take on all the karma.

7
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:22,857
I want you to seal the Demon

8
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:26,228
and do your best to avoid...

9
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,038
the consequences.

10
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:31,267
I will do as you say, Father.

11
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:36,107
Have you found traces of the Demon?

12
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:38,247
It has disappeared.

13
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,148
The Demon...

14
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:42,618
never dies.

15
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:45,187
Sealing it is the only way...

16
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,517
Father!

17
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:52,657
Father!

18
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:01,137
Restore the king's portrait as soon as possible...

19
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:03,908
so that we can seal the Demon once again.

20
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,107
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:08,611
But before we do that,

22
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:11,647
we must find an artist who can restore the portrait.

23
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,951
An artist who can portray divinity...

24
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:16,321
so that the spirit of the Demon can be sealed.

25
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:19,448
I am talking about artists like Gan Yong Guk and Hong Eun O.

26
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,427
Find me an artist...

27
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,267
no matter what.

28
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:33,098
Yes, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:44,752
(Episode 2: The Divine Artist)

30
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,607
(Baekyu Painters Society)

31
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:52,147
(19 years later, 31st year of King Seongjo)

32
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:29,152
- Look. - Goodness.

33
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:30,318
Let us go see.

34
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:32,688
How beautiful.

35
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,217
Gosh, my heart is fluttering.

36
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:45,301
My heart beats so fast just by watching.

37
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:48,897
If your heart beats that fast just by looking at a painting,

38
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:51,267
you should go see a doctor.

39
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,637
- Hello. - I am sorry.

40
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,137
Hurry.

41
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:05,191
Among many different types of Sehwa paintings,

42
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,488
let us learn about "The Old Man of the South Pole."

43
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:12,988
What is most important when it comes to Sehwa paintings?

44
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:17,498
Obviously to finish it by the due date.

45
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:20,837
Otherwise, no one will buy it.

46
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:23,041
- She is right. - That is correct.

47
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,508
She has a point.

48
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,068
Finishing it quickly...

49
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:31,777
is not the most important thing when it comes to Sehwa paintings.

50
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:36,318
How short this man is. The deer he is riding.

51
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,318
The protruding head.

52
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:42,017
You must portray these exact characteristics.

53
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:45,988
That is how you form a lucky omen.

54
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,762
You made an excellent choice by hiring him...

55
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,428
as today's lecturer.

56
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,972
Choi Jung, a painter from Gohwawon,

57
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,198
came here to teach them himself.

58
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,267
No lecture would be better for the painters.

59
00:05:58,413 --> 00:05:59,767
My goodness.

60
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,111
You fool.

61
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,748
You need to do more than just copy the paintings.

62
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,352
When it comes to Sehwa paintings, it is most important...

63
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:10,988
to use clear colors and portray joy in the paintings.

64
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:14,121
In other words, you must portray people's longing desire...

65
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,421
to be blessed with luck, joy,

66
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:19,858
happiness, and beauty.

67
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:22,798
She really is something.

68
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,798
Painter Hong, if you are done,

69
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,402
stop causing trouble and just leave.

70
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,198
I was going to leave.

71
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:37,948
- Master Choi. - Gosh, you startled me.

72
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,678
Uncle Chun Bok, here you go.

73
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:43,548
I need to go somewhere. I will be right back.

74
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,017
Where are you going at this hour, young lady?

75
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:52,027
Where is she going every night?

76
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:56,498
Probably to the market to meet Hong Eun O.

77
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:01,668
Chun Bok, do you know something?

78
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:05,142
Do you know how long she has been taking care of her father?

79
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,472
Yes, 20 years.

80
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,881
You already told me dozens of times.

81
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,282
So you do not need to remind me...

82
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:13,381
She was just a little girl...

83
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,782
who couldn't see a thing.

84
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:19,092
One rainy day, her vision returned...

85
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,358
and told me she needs to make money to take care of her father.

86
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:25,162
She asked me to teach her how to paint...

87
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,832
and said she will chop firewood and do the dishes.

88
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,871
The skies must have been touched by her filial devotion...

89
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,472
and gave her sight back.

90
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:36,202
And just like her father,

91
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,842
she not only quickly learned how to paint,

92
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:42,207
but she was also very talented.

93
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:45,077
I could not help but care for...

94
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:47,618
her.

95
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:00,188
Look at how handsome he is.

96
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,757
There is more to him than that. He is also a gentleman.

97
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:05,757
I heard he is favored by His Majesty.

98
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,227
Look at him glow.

99
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:16,072
What is going on? What is all the fuss about?

100
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,342
You know why.

101
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:19,408
Scholar Ha is on duty tonight.

102
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,481
But then again, even I think...

103
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:25,007
he is as handsome as I am.

104
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:29,948
At the end of the day, he is blind. They are unbelievable.

105
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,991
- By the way, - Yes?

106
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,792
I heard Scholar Ha was the helper...

107
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,261
of the rainmaking ritual that took place 19 years ago.

108
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,262
Yes.

109
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:39,292
Did he really lose his sight that day?

110
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,001
Yes, that is correct.

111
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:44,028
That was when it finally rained in nine years.

112
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,172
Is that why he is called the guarding spirit of this place?

113
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,342
What are you talking about?

114
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:52,107
He is nothing but a freak.

115
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,048
Scholar Ha is here.

116
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:03,818
Hello, Scholar Ha.

117
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,422
- Hello. - Hello.

118
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,092
Let us begin the observation.

119
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,717
We will begin with the Vermilion Bird of the South.

120
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:11,327
We will begin with the Vermilion Bird of the South.

121
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,491
- Yes. - Yes.

122
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,028
Let us begin the observation.

123
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:20,727
The fifth star is extremely bright today.

124
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:24,038
Someone special will come from the east.

125
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:20,487
Who are you people?

126
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:22,198
You are here.

127
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:25,367
They are my pals. Come on in.

128
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,668
- What took you so long? - I am sorry.

129
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:38,977
The swirling clouds surrounding the peak of the mountain.

130
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,747
The pointy pine tree branches.

131
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:44,518
Is this...

132
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:46,948
the original painting?

133
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,257
You really do have an eye for art.

134
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:58,072
I guess Wolseongdang really does buy and sell rare artwork.

135
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,172
What would happen if it gets torn...

136
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,398
Stop.

137
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:05,007
Do not even touch it. It is worth four houses.

138
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,337
What? Four houses?

139
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,747
I am finally done.

140
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:16,077
Hey, take a look. What do you think?

141
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,357
You really are talented.

142
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,922
You actually copied that.

143
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,332
You made it look just like the original copy.

144
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,357
What are the virtues of making imitations?

145
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:32,202
First, copy the techniques.

146
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:35,172
Second, portray the energy in the original work.

147
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:38,737
Third, it needs to be exactly the same.

148
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:44,278
Will you stop being so arrogant?

149
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,448
Okay, fine.

150
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:51,222
I bet you my precious brush...

151
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:54,422
that not even Prince Yangmyeong, the lover of arts,

152
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,891
will not be able to notice that mine is an imitation.

153
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,028
Really?

154
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:04,832
My gosh, why did they have to build the storage here?

155
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,731
I will never come back here again.

156
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:09,538
Did you guys ever hear about...

157
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:11,237
the owner of Wolseongdang?

158
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:12,411
Ilwolseong?

159
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:15,212
He is known to be the richest man in Guanyang.

160
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:17,308
The most famous merchant in this country.

161
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:19,781
That makes sense seeing that he was able to buy "Sochundo."

162
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,922
That is not all.

163
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:24,521
There are tons of original artworks in Wolseongdang.

164
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:25,617
You are right.

165
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:29,318
There is another big secret.

166
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,661
If you write a question...

167
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,891
and put it inside the box in front of Wolseongdang,

168
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:35,631
Ilwolseong writes you back...

169
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:39,072
saying you will have to pay a price for the answer.

170
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:42,602
In other words, Ilwolseong is an informant...

171
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,408
who knows everything.

172
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:48,641
But you must be careful.

173
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:53,352
Apparently, no one has ever seen his face.

174
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,352
He speaks from an adjoining room,

175
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:56,922
and you can only hear his voice...

176
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,288
that does not sound like it belongs to a human.

177
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:03,288
And they say whoever sees his face...

178
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,727
will get beheaded.

179
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:09,227
You and that darn mouth of yours.

180
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:13,068
Do not believe him. Half of what he says is a lie.

181
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:16,798
What? Does that mean you believe me half of the time?

182
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,707
Unfortunately, I am not even interested in the other half.

183
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,107
Ilwolseong?

184
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,007
Hey, wait up.

185
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,172
Yoo Si Hong, the younger brother of Yeon's emperor,

186
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,597
is coming here as a messenger?

187
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,802
That is unusual.

188
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:52,972
Is there a special reason why...

189
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:55,207
you chose to work at Jangwangjang today?

190
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:57,011
According to the stars last night,

191
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:59,477
someone special will come today from the east.

192
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:02,918
The entrance of Jangwangjang is facing the east.

193
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,048
Can you guess whom it might be?

194
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:11,627
I am not sure.

195
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:15,158
I wonder whom that special person will be.

196
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:19,933
Hello.

197
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,938
Jung, are you there?

198
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:26,068
Goodness, look who is here. It is Painter Hong.

199
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:27,911
I would like to get paid first.

200
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,678
First, let me take a look at the painting.

201
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:34,781
It is hard to tell which one is the original copy.

202
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:36,682
This is why I like you.

203
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:40,548
How should I put it? You have no pride as a painter.

204
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:43,558
They both look exactly the same.

205
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:44,932
Is that a compliment?

206
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,062
It is a great compliment.

207
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:48,261
Most painters who draw imitations...

208
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:50,832
try very hard to leave a trace of their identity.

209
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,371
They are not even an aristocrat.

210
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,641
Those painters also think of imitations as their work.

211
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,268
I did not know that.

212
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,107
Here you go.

213
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,707
Let me check.

214
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,178
It is the right amount.

215
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:15,757
What is this?

216
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:17,891
It is my gesture of gratitude.

217
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:20,428
Gosh, why are you acting like you are going to quit?

218
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:23,861
That is right. I have earned enough money for my father's medicine.

219
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:29,038
Thus, that is going to be my last imitation.

220
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:34,268
Keep quiet about all my works as you have promised.

221
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,808
You are quitting?

222
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,908
Well, okay.

223
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:42,617
Painter Hong.

224
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:47,491
Drawing imitations is very hard to quit.

225
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:49,357
It is like a drug.

226
00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:58,967
What is with you guys?

227
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,898
What is with us?

228
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:05,938
Do you really not know?

229
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:09,178
We favored you and treated you like a real painter,

230
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,277
and that must have caused you to become arrogant.

231
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,022
Let me see.

232
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:18,088
I cannot hurt your wrist.

233
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:22,987
Are you threatening me?

234
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,262
Have you forgotten who I am?

235
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:31,272
Of course not. You are the only female painter in this city.

236
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:32,997
The only female of the Baekyu Painters Society.

237
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:37,941
What do you think this will do to the reputation of Wolseongdang...

238
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:39,737
that is known to be the best art studio?

239
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:45,651
What? Are you going to cut me with that?

240
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:46,908
Go ahead.

241
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:48,517
Wait.

242
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:52,188
Here is my wrist.

243
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,037
You are bolder than most men.

244
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:17,441
You are wiser than most men.

245
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,007
Leave before I change my mind.

246
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,348
You had better not change your mind.

247
00:18:57,823 --> 00:18:59,047
What are you doing?

248
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:05,457
Is there someone here?

249
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,398
What is with you? I told you to leave.

250
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,267
Do not talk nonsense and just go.

251
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,037
Okay.

252
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:20,838
I will be off now. Thank you for everything.

253
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:22,977
Goodbye to you too.

254
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:28,621
Are you really going to let her leave?

255
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,017
Just get ready to go to the capital city.

256
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,721
The lord in Bukchon-ri is waiting for us.

257
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,658
Do not get it mixed with the original artwork.

258
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:51,742
Goodness, the color is so beautiful.

259
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:53,042
Do you see that?

260
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:56,138
This color comes from a turtle that lived for 10,000 years.

261
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:59,151
A turtle with a gold shell and a yellow neck.

262
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:02,451
It is a medicine that was made with a 10,000-year-old ingredient.

263
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,948
Unless it's a real 10,000-year gold turtle pill,

264
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,047
it can't be this color.

265
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:10,057
Okay.

266
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,628
I like it.

267
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:26,072
If you take just one of these pills,

268
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,842
from the moment you take it, its effects...

269
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:30,338
slowly start to show.

270
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:33,482
Is that true? That's it, then.

271
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,977
I can finally cure my dad's madness.

272
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:46,332
No, it's fine. No discounts.

273
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,828
You'll jinx the medicine.

274
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,161
I won't haggle. 50 Yang.

275
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:53,431
Fights should be stopped and deals should be made.

276
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:57,398
No, I want to take this pill with its effects and everything.

277
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:00,168
Here you go.

278
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,777
Fifty Yang of silver.

279
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:03,378
You can check.

280
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:15,088
- I'll go, then. - Sure.

281
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:17,158
Thank you.

282
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:22,027
- Come and take a look! - Take a look!

283
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:34,767
Dad, it's me, Cheon Gi.

284
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,747
Cheon Gi?

285
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:42,578
My Cheon Gi's still a baby.

286
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,388
Today's work looks pretty good.

287
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:49,287
Can you draw me?

288
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:50,858
Of course.

289
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:09,482
Mister, since yesterday,

290
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:13,277
you only made hoes, sickles, and plows, didn't you?

291
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:17,317
I hear round, low sounds like my hands.

292
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:24,817
Do you know how much I looked for you?

293
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:27,358
I told you where I'd be.

294
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:30,358
Did you forget again, Dad?

295
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,698
What?

296
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:45,378
Your drawings are really nice.

297
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:48,918
To pay you for the drawing,

298
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:51,848
I will give you this.

299
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:54,517
Open your mouth.

300
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:09,842
What are you doing?

301
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:12,371
My Cheon Gi will be hungry too.

302
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:14,868
I didn't give her much for breakfast.

303
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,752
I brought more than enough food.

304
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,118
You can eat it all.

305
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,658
Dad.

306
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:31,557
You can eat it all.

307
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,898
I also have...

308
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,767
something very precious.

309
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:49,608
What's that?

310
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:51,638
Eat this too.

311
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:55,421
When you eat this, you must smell it first,

312
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:57,747
and then taste it when it's in your mouth.

313
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,747
You must savor it twice.

314
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:01,987
Here.

315
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:11,997
What is this?

316
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,198
It's my everything.

317
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:28,378
I hope you can say, "Hong Cheon Gi, my daughter,"

318
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:32,618
and hold my brush with me like before.

319
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:37,457
And scold me not to paint copies again.

320
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:41,487
I'd like you to tell me that painting without heart...

321
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:43,328
is of no use.

322
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,467
What a smell.

323
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:56,207
She didn't catch on, did she?

324
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:57,878
She's a very bright kid.

325
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:00,648
We made sure she didn't notice a thing.

326
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:02,777
Here.

327
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:07,017
- Let's go. - Wait.

328
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:12,588
Please, can I have the deeds to my home back?

329
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:16,227
The house was in my family for three generations.

330
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:32,908
Who told you to offer a human sacrifice?

331
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:35,052
I did it on my own.

332
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:36,717
Kill me if you must, Your Majesty.

333
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:44,287
It wouldn't have rained if not for the human sacrifice.

334
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:46,762
The public would've resented it even more,

335
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,858
and the government would've been in distress.

336
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:50,957
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

337
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,138
It rained,

338
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:03,378
so I will spare you your life.

339
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:05,648
As soon as day breaks,

340
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,848
you are to leave the Palace.

341
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,418
And...

342
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:12,088
never return even in death.

343
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:16,957
Your Majesty, I pray for your health.

344
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,928
The Prince has come to see you.

345
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,302
It seems like it was just yesterday...

346
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:31,497
that you came to me after Father sent you away.

347
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,438
That was 20 years ago already.

348
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:39,181
You haven't forgotten your vow, have you?

349
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,948
How could I?

350
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:42,918
That day,

351
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:45,747
I said I did not find you.

352
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:48,717
I said the heavens had picked you.

353
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:52,232
Yes. When will that time come?

354
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:53,888
The undying.

355
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:57,461
When you accept the power of the Demon who presides over death,

356
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,467
then your time will come.

357
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,901
How many years have you been saying that?

358
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:04,898
Compared to the deities, humans live just for a moment.

359
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:07,608
Their time flows unlike ours.

360
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,938
Try not to be so impatient.

361
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:18,951
Isn't that a white crow?

362
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,717
A good omen that comes every 1,000 years.

363
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:23,688
It was found dead in a mountain not long ago.

364
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:28,232
In the near future, a huge mishap will come upon us.

365
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:29,658
A mishap?

366
00:27:36,942 --> 00:27:38,098
Father.

367
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:41,368
Will I really be able to see again?

368
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:45,408
Yes. Don't worry at all.

369
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,277
Om mani padme hum.

370
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,747
Om mani padme hum.

371
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:55,287
Om...

372
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,457
It has been a while.

373
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:04,557
You're...

374
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:09,598
Investigator Kim Gong Rae?

375
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:11,098
Investigator?

376
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:14,737
If you had died when you went over that cliff,

377
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:17,477
I would not have had to do this.

378
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:20,711
Why are you doing this?

379
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:23,721
Over ten years have passed since the late king's command.

380
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:25,752
Even if 100 years have passed, it must be carried out.

381
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:26,753
The king's command?

382
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:29,361
I risked my life to seal the Demon,

383
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:32,292
and my son lost his sight to bring us rain!

384
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,757
Is this what we get in return?

385
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:38,527
Father!

386
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,471
No!

387
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:47,611
- Father! - No!

388
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:50,138
- You can't take them! - Father!

389
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:51,911
- Father! - Son!

390
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:53,782
You're taking my husband's body...

391
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,651
and my son as well?

392
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:56,881
It's the King's command.

393
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,448
- Mother! - Ha Ram!

394
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:01,418
Do you wish to die too?

395
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,557
No. Mother!

396
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:16,737
That day,

397
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:19,307
you killed three people.

398
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:21,838
I will make you...

399
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:24,178
pay for the price of bloodshed.

400
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:25,848
I swear.

401
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:33,921
You're late, Moo Young.

402
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:36,361
We got a pigeon from the Palace.

403
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:38,517
- Is it about the Crown Prince? - Yes.

404
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:41,032
He was traveling to a hot spring...

405
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,698
when he was attacked by assassins.

406
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,401
Who's behind it?

407
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:46,572
Wolseongdang sent out their informants.

408
00:29:46,573 --> 00:29:48,168
We should hear soon.

409
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:51,438
But then,

410
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:54,368
the King has been sick for a while.

411
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:56,482
The Crown Prince is sickly,

412
00:29:56,483 --> 00:30:00,277
so it's the perfect timing for those who want to take power.

413
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,148
It seems that...

414
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,517
the time has come for me too.

415
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:14,158
We're about to have an important guest tonight.

416
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,002
I'm sorry for the trouble, Moo Young.

417
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,128
Yes, my lord.

418
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:29,338
My lord, it's another bull's eye.

419
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:33,711
I hear that the Crown Prince was attacked...

420
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:36,777
during his trip to the hot spring.

421
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:41,717
Was it done by a treasonous group...

422
00:30:42,563 --> 00:30:44,457
that wish to overturn the royal authority?

423
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,658
I can't seem to go to sleep.

424
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,467
It's too early to jump to a conclusion.

425
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:59,007
However, if you're still worried,

426
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:02,737
it might not be a bad idea to meet with Ilwolseong.

427
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,438
Ilwolseong?

428
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:08,408
Yes, he's a man with wisdom and information of Zhuge Liang.

429
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:11,017
Why haven't I heard of this man...

430
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,421
until today?

431
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:14,891
I apologize, my lord.

432
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:17,621
He's a very careful and secretive man,

433
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:21,158
so no one has heard his voice or seen his face to this day.

434
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,557
So you weren't lying.

435
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:30,072
No, I wasn't. How would I dare to lie before you?

436
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:32,168
If what you said is true,

437
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:38,777
then don't we need him even if we must ask him three times or more?

438
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:40,678
Where can I meet him?

439
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:44,817
You'll find his request box in the middle of the city.

440
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,572
My name is Moo Young of Wolseongdang.

441
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,368
I came to take the request.

442
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:08,611
Lead us to your master.

443
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:11,941
I'm here with a nobleman. Do delay this any further.

444
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:16,482
I apologize, but my master does not show himself to anybody.

445
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:19,822
How dare you speak like that before him?

446
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:24,792
However, he already expected to meet the Prince tonight.

447
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:26,492
If you do not pry into his identity,

448
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:28,727
- you'll get the answer you want... - How dare you?

449
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,838
I understand.

450
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:43,511
Your Highness.

451
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:46,807
It's all right. I completely understand...

452
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:53,048
the wish of Ilwolseong.

453
00:32:57,962 --> 00:33:00,827
In 7 days, 23rd period, at Simcheonggak.

454
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:02,657
From Ilwolseong.

455
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,458
Ilwolseong.

456
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,867
- Come and take a look. - Come and get what you need!

457
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:23,978
No, I asked you to draw me something to put up on my gates.

458
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:26,751
What on earth are you drawing? What is this?

459
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:30,258
Darn it, what a fraud. Darn it.

460
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:34,988
Hey, did you get anything done?

461
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,298
You're here.

462
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:40,998
Did you get that medicine you were talking about?

463
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:42,768
Yes, I did.

464
00:33:43,343 --> 00:33:44,738
So how was it?

465
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:48,438
Can't you tell?

466
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:51,112
Her eyes look completely empty,

467
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,807
so she must've been scammed again.

468
00:33:56,822 --> 00:34:00,817
Hey! Didn't I always tell you that you'd better watch your mouth?

469
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:16,738
I'll take this drawing.

470
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:19,968
I can't.

471
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:25,082
Don't be like that. Give me this drawing.

472
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,408
No.

473
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:31,182
I'll give you a good price, so just give it to me.

474
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:32,522
No, I can't.

475
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:34,551
Give it to me. You're going to rip it.

476
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:37,058
- Old lady, what's wrong? - Let go. It'll get ripped.

477
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:38,587
I'll have it.

478
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:41,328
Doesn't it look nice?

479
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,658
- Goodness. - Give it to me.

480
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:53,707
Anyway, it looks like you might get on a litter soon.

481
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:56,607
Sorry?

482
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:02,752
Don't worry about it. It's for a great occasion.

483
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:04,317
Wait, old lady!

484
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,058
Dad.

485
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:17,258
It's me, Dad. Your daughter, Cheon Gi.

486
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:23,037
Do you want me to draw you something?

487
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:37,038
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] SBS E02 'Lovers of the Red Sky'</font>

488
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:46,328
Oh no.

489
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,598
Don't stand there in the rain. Get in here.

490
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:03,008
Right, my daughter.

491
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:05,207
Dad.

492
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:07,881
This is just a shower. It'll stop soon.

493
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,852
Let me go. My daughter can't even see.

494
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:14,252
She probably can't avoid the rain in this cold weather.

495
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:16,917
Then I'll bring her, so wait here.

496
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,158
All right, then.

497
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:23,361
She's about this tall.

498
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:24,662
And she has a stick, right?

499
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:25,798
Yes.

500
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:27,598
All right.

501
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:30,571
Don't go anywhere. Sit here and wait for me.

502
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:32,267
I'll bring her.

503
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,058
About Cheon Gi.

504
00:36:52,192 --> 00:36:54,388
I don't feel so comfortable...

505
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,158
about deceiving that poor girl.

506
00:36:57,503 --> 00:37:01,328
Watch your mouth. Our lives are at stake too.

507
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:05,071
We just need to turn a blind eye to this.

508
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:09,207
Goodness, you foolish man. Why did you get into gambling?

509
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:14,647
Even if she realizes that she bought fake medicine,

510
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:19,888
we cannot be the ones who spill the truth of the matter.

511
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:27,928
Cheon Gi.

512
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:31,357
What did you just say? Deceiving me?

513
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:38,738
What do you mean by that?

514
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:43,381
I'm sorry, Cheon Gi.

515
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:46,207
What in the world are you talking about?

516
00:37:56,222 --> 00:37:59,058
My lord, you're here.

517
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:02,798
Why did you drink so much?

518
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,227
My love, my precious.

519
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:17,781
Darn it, you shameless man.

520
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:18,877
My gosh!

521
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,548
Where's the exit?

522
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,348
Stop right there!

523
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,948
Hey! Stop right there!

524
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:30,558
Stop right there!

525
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,627
- Hey! - I have no idea!

526
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:35,028
Stop right there!

527
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:38,957
Hey! You shameless jerk!

528
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:41,528
- Hey! - Move aside!

529
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:45,103
Goodness!

530
00:38:45,104 --> 00:38:46,671
Do you know what that money is worth?

531
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:50,441
I wanted to help my dad, so I saved up that money...

532
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:53,982
without eating, spending, and even getting criticized!

533
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,452
Did you wish to live after doing something like this?

534
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:57,921
Give me my money back!

535
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:59,278
Stop right there!

536
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,287
Give me my money!

537
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:05,162
My gosh, she's one feisty woman.

538
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:06,392
Stop right there, you jerk!

539
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:07,631
Wait, move aside.

540
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:08,957
My money!

541
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,158
What's going on?

542
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:17,897
It looks like there is a ruckus here.

543
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:23,537
Goodness, Hoo.

544
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,747
It's great to run into you in a place like this.

545
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:28,877
Yes, Yul.

546
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,982
Were you writing poems with other scholars here?

547
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,118
Yes.

548
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:36,691
Nice to meet you. My name is Mae Hyang.

549
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:39,122
You're Mae Hyang, the flower of Simcheonggak.

550
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:42,727
You must be Prince Joohyang. I've heard so much about you.

551
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:47,098
You can all meet later.

552
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:50,837
I'm glad you came. You should join us.

553
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:55,667
I'll have to postpone it.

554
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:57,937
I have an urgent engagement.

555
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:03,321
You're always so serious. We never have any fun.

556
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:05,752
How do you always remain the same?

557
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:09,321
People say they'll die if they suddenly change.

558
00:40:09,322 --> 00:40:12,861
Goodness, this isn't the only day for us.

559
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:16,062
You'll be holding a painting contest soon.

560
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:17,702
The two of us can spend...

561
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:19,397
all night drinking together.

562
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:20,627
What?

563
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,267
Will you really come, Hoo?

564
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:28,372
It looks like this contest will go down in history.

565
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:31,508
Then I hope you all have fun.

566
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:35,178
Goodbye, Hoo.

567
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:51,631
Are you Ilwolseong?

568
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:54,067
Yes, my lord. Please take a seat.

569
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:55,828
Sure.

570
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:03,138
Did you read through the request?

571
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:10,377
"There was a precious jade in green in a place beyond anyone's reach."

572
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:14,787
"Recently, a night prowler has come and tried to steal the jade."

573
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:18,488
"Was it just a petty thief who was blinded by the jade?"

574
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:21,227
"Or was it a big thief who put out his life..."

575
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:22,727
"because he knew its worth?"

576
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:25,928
Yes. Do you understand...

577
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,598
my concern?

578
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:33,138
The green jade must be a jade marble.

579
00:41:33,313 --> 00:41:36,638
In other words, it's your brother, the Crown Prince's realm.

580
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:38,707
The unreachable place must be the sky.

581
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:42,408
In a nutshell, this means the Crown Prince's palace.

582
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:45,548
And?

583
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:47,388
If this was a petty thief,

584
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,817
you wouldn't have stepped up yourself.

585
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:53,227
I'm sure it's a big thief.

586
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:56,698
Such a thief believes he's a big, nobleman.

587
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:58,897
And a man like that...

588
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,167
reached out to the unreachable sky,

589
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:05,798
it can only mean treason.

590
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:10,638
What's your ground for that conclusion?

591
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:22,017
I heard the Crown Prince...

592
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:26,627
came across an assassin during his trip to the hot spring.

593
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:30,058
Was this found on the paper?

594
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:33,167
If that's not a sign of treason,

595
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,732
what else could it mean?

596
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:36,997
Are you saying...

597
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:41,808
the incident of that assassin was an act of treason?

598
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:43,707
Do you...

599
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:45,282
truly wish to know?

600
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:46,452
Speak!

601
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:47,678
In that case,

602
00:42:47,713 --> 00:42:50,078
you shouldn't be here talking to me.

603
00:42:51,253 --> 00:42:53,118
You should look into a mirror.

604
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:56,417
Wasn't it you, Prince Joohyang,

605
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,727
who sent that assassin his way?

606
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,808
Do you really wish...

607
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,642
to die in my hands?

608
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:18,738
If...

609
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:21,578
the power behind this incident comes out to the light,

610
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:26,048
then you, Prince Joohyang, who tested me with this paper,

611
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:30,917
wouldn't be able to survive.

612
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:48,567
You.

613
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:53,781
No.

614
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:55,348
Have you forgotten?

615
00:43:56,652 --> 00:43:59,048
You promised not to pry into...

616
00:44:00,322 --> 00:44:01,848
my identity.

617
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:08,258
What persuaded Zhuge Liang...

618
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:10,798
wasn't a sword.

619
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:15,897
I do not believe you're an impatient man,

620
00:44:16,603 --> 00:44:18,567
because you still...

621
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,468
let the current king live in peace and safety.

622
00:44:25,483 --> 00:44:26,747
You will...

623
00:44:29,453 --> 00:44:31,848
meet me again in good time.

624
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:43,428
This was my test.

625
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:45,558
Your wisdom and boldness are...

626
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:47,468
as great as I've heard, Ilwolseong.

627
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,937
I look forward to the day we meet again.

628
00:44:58,183 --> 00:44:59,477
Should I track him?

629
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:01,107
No.

630
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:04,348
He's not a man who'll kneel before my sword.

631
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:08,118
- Let's go. - Yes, Your Highness.

632
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:26,808
You! You fraud!

633
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:30,877
Give me my money. Give me my money back!

634
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:32,881
I don't know anything!

635
00:45:32,882 --> 00:45:34,511
I just did as Jung asked!

636
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:36,417
What? Jung?

637
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:38,017
Is Wolseongdang a part of this too?

638
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:40,287
It was an organized crime, wasn't it?

639
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:43,192
I don't know anything.

640
00:45:43,193 --> 00:45:46,287
Stop right there, you scammer of Wolseongdang!

641
00:45:47,563 --> 00:45:50,901
Did I just hear that right?

642
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:54,567
Yes, she clearly said, "You scammer..."

643
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,497
"of Wolseongdang!"

644
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:03,241
Tell Moo Young to find out everything that happened...

645
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:04,607
in Wolseongdang to this day.

646
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:06,477
Yes, my lord.

647
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,712
Let's go, that's it.

648
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:10,952
Yes, did I keep you waiting?

649
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:12,821
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

650
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:14,421
It's not like the sun has come up.

651
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:15,491
What did you say?

652
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:18,258
Are you saying I become wasted every single day?

653
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:20,558
Anyway,

654
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:23,497
don't you think you stop by the gisaeng house too often?

655
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:26,627
What can I do? I get conscious of what people think of me.

656
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:27,868
You do?

657
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:30,471
They say my power has grown tremendously big.

658
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:31,997
What power, Your Highness?

659
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:36,542
The problem is that I only associate with the nobleman.

660
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,682
I mean, it's not easy for a prince of a nation...

661
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:42,812
to look this handsome and to have excellent calligraphy.

662
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:45,182
If this handsome prince must live with a misunderstanding...

663
00:46:45,183 --> 00:46:47,721
because of my love for literature and arts,

664
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,187
then I do not mind living my life like this.

665
00:46:50,523 --> 00:46:52,522
I shouldn't have said that.

666
00:46:52,523 --> 00:46:55,031
No, you can say that once again.

667
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:57,462
And start over at my handsome looks.

668
00:46:57,463 --> 00:47:00,167
The handsome prince...

669
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:09,767
This is why I like you.

670
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:12,607
Jung...

671
00:47:14,983 --> 00:47:16,348
Wolseongdang.

672
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:26,991
Hey, what is this?

673
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:29,457
Anyway, what's with your face?

674
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:33,727
I need your help. Gather round.

675
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:36,368
What happened is...

676
00:47:40,313 --> 00:47:43,908
Now, this is a painting of a bamboo by Wun Dong of Qing.

677
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:46,452
I hear this place has the biggest collection...

678
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:48,412
and that you sell the paintings...

679
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:51,482
at a handsome price, so I decided to come by.

680
00:47:51,483 --> 00:47:52,817
You're at the right place.

681
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:59,861
That costs over 100 Yang of silver.

682
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:02,328
Be careful. Be very careful with it.

683
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:06,062
I'll contact you once the painting is sold.

684
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:07,702
You can relax and wait.

685
00:48:07,703 --> 00:48:10,267
Roll it up. Careful.

686
00:48:10,342 --> 00:48:12,738
To the left. That's it.

687
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:15,037
Is anybody here?

688
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:19,881
What is it?

689
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:21,781
We heard you copy the paintings people leave here...

690
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:24,122
and sell them back as if it's the genuine piece.

691
00:48:24,123 --> 00:48:26,477
Search through.

692
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:27,687
- Yes. - Yes.

693
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:30,861
Search for what? What are you doing?

694
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:33,727
What is this? Who's trying to frame me like this?

695
00:48:37,933 --> 00:48:40,397
This isn't an imitation. It's the real one.

696
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:42,528
Painter Choi.

697
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,567
He's a painter of junior eighth rank at Gohwawon.

698
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:53,348
He's here to evaluate this to tell us if this is a copy.

699
00:48:56,753 --> 00:48:58,118
It was copied.

700
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:01,551
What kind of nonsense is this?

701
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:03,147
This isn't a copy!

702
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:06,587
Why is there an insect in a bamboo painting by Wun Dong?

703
00:49:06,663 --> 00:49:08,558
- What? - That's impossible.

704
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:12,497
Also, this paper came from Moonsung, right across the street.

705
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:15,167
Look.

706
00:49:16,273 --> 00:49:18,267
There's the mark for Moonsung.

707
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:20,638
This can't be.

708
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,167
This can't be right!

709
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:24,908
- Arrest him. - Yes.

710
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:27,308
This is unfair. I've been framed!

711
00:49:27,483 --> 00:49:29,182
I don't know anything about this.

712
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:30,817
I'm not like that!

713
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:33,392
It's not a big deal.

714
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,548
I was just there to talk.

715
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:37,517
It's not a big deal.

716
00:50:16,032 --> 00:50:17,932
It's not a big deal.

717
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:21,167
- I can't believe that man. - What a shame.

718
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,971
Hong Cheon Gi, you brat. It was you, wasn't it?

719
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:25,671
Are you out of your mind?

720
00:50:25,672 --> 00:50:28,511
You'll pay for this! You're just an insect!

721
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:30,537
I will crush you!

722
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:34,508
That made me feel so much better.

723
00:51:02,713 --> 00:51:04,281
Is that good enough?

724
00:51:04,282 --> 00:51:07,147
You should be able to handle most thugs now.

725
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:11,477
Did you ask about the gisaeng house incident?

726
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:15,917
Vice-chief Jung Seon Rye had been making a profit selling copies.

727
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:19,691
A painter who provided the copies wanted to quit,

728
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:22,491
so he deceived her and took her money.

729
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,162
And she found out.

730
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:28,028
Yes, and because of that, Jung Seon Rye was arrested today.

731
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:29,532
Was he?

732
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:33,198
It seems he got caught selling forgeries.

733
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:37,812
Do you mean he was arrested because of the copycat painter?

734
00:51:37,813 --> 00:51:39,008
Yes.

735
00:51:46,753 --> 00:51:48,651
Close Wolseongdang...

736
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:51,457
and find the copycat painter to find out more.

737
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:59,957
My lord, it is time to go to the Palace.

738
00:52:01,072 --> 00:52:02,872
If this was not treason,

739
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:05,567
would anyone have attacked the Crown Prince?

740
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,207
Dozens of soldiers failed to catch the assassin.

741
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:11,781
I find that hard to believe.

742
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:13,241
Of the Five Polar Stars within...

743
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:14,752
the Small Purple Custer indicating the palace,

744
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:16,881
the Crown Prince's star is bright and strong,

745
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:20,388
so you need not worry about his safety.

746
00:52:22,322 --> 00:52:23,687
Is that so?

747
00:52:24,322 --> 00:52:29,162
What I wonder is, shouldn't we find out who's threatening us...

748
00:52:29,163 --> 00:52:31,401
and punish them for it?

749
00:52:31,402 --> 00:52:33,571
I heard that when a king causes bloodshed,

750
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:36,198
it stays with the family for a thousand years.

751
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:42,207
You are still concerned about the blood your late father shed.

752
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:46,207
Times like this is when you must be even more resolute.

753
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:48,348
Yes.

754
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:51,778
I should.

755
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:55,448
Come closer.

756
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:08,131
From now on, out of the Five Polar Stars,

757
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:11,468
keep a close eye on the second and third stars that represent...

758
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,167
Joohyang and Yangmyeong.

759
00:53:14,413 --> 00:53:17,738
That is my special and secret command to you.

760
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:20,008
I will do as commanded.

761
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:24,747
Do you still have no memory of the past?

762
00:53:26,722 --> 00:53:27,817
I do not.

763
00:53:27,922 --> 00:53:32,118
I still remember nothing right after the rainmaking ritual 19 years ago.

764
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:34,587
However,

765
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:40,158
sometimes, bits and pieces of my memory return.

766
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:46,167
It's a relief to hear you're making progress.

767
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:47,937
Yes.

768
00:53:49,242 --> 00:53:50,837
It's a great relief.

769
00:53:59,822 --> 00:54:00,917
Your Majesty.

770
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,158
I may have no memory of that day,

771
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:08,227
but how could I forget absolutely everything?

772
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:12,528
Until those who killed my father...

773
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:17,368
and ruined my family and my life pay the price,

774
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:24,078
I can never forget...

775
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:27,348
or stop what I'm doing.

776
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:32,147
- Are you sure? - Yes.

777
00:54:32,623 --> 00:54:33,718
Boss.

778
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:36,522
What took you so long?

779
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,417
They demanded triple the amount this time.

780
00:54:40,492 --> 00:54:43,897
They took triple the bribe and treated me like this?

781
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:45,962
He said you should be grateful they're letting you go.

782
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:47,227
Don't.

783
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:49,167
Hong Cheon Gi.

784
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:51,167
Where is she?

785
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,437
Good riddance, Jung Seon Rye.

786
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:56,868
The jerk.

787
00:55:02,183 --> 00:55:05,147
Getting revenge doesn't mean I'll get the money back.

788
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,948
My gosh.

789
00:55:12,793 --> 00:55:16,901
All that happened to you were out of everyone's control.

790
00:55:16,902 --> 00:55:18,658
It wasn't your fault.

791
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:21,428
That random comment...

792
00:55:23,302 --> 00:55:25,238
still offers some comfort.

793
00:55:27,342 --> 00:55:28,437
Yes.

794
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:29,968
Hey, Nuisance.

795
00:55:30,483 --> 00:55:32,377
What do you want now?

796
00:55:33,183 --> 00:55:36,381
Wolseongdang Jung Seon Rye conned me out of 50 Yang.

797
00:55:36,382 --> 00:55:39,377
His master Ilwolseong must give me 100 Yang.

798
00:55:40,822 --> 00:55:41,822
My gosh.

799
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,957
You've been quite busy, Painter Hong.

800
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:47,828
What do you want from...

801
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:49,428
me?

802
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:50,662
What do you think?

803
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:54,227
You sent me to rot in prison for a while, but I didn't stay long.

804
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:55,868
Oh?

805
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,468
What, 100 Yang?

806
00:56:01,742 --> 00:56:03,877
You cheeky thing.

807
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,082
- Shoot. - Darn it. Get her!

808
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,508
- After her! - Get her!

809
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:14,147
- Darn. - Stop!

810
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,957
Oh, no.

811
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:23,031
Boss! Boss!

812
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:25,758
- Boss! - Get up!

813
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,127
Where is she?

814
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:30,402
Go that way!

815
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:31,471
Okay.

816
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,037
What a brat.

817
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:37,678
Scholar Ha, we reached the gate.

818
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:40,881
I'll show the guard our nighttime travel permit.

819
00:56:40,882 --> 00:56:42,178
Okay.

820
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:50,817
What? Jung? Is Wolseongdang a part of this too?

821
00:56:51,123 --> 00:56:52,488
How did I get involved?

822
00:56:55,592 --> 00:56:58,928
I don't know who you are, but please ignore me for now.

823
00:56:59,603 --> 00:57:00,698
But...

824
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:05,167
- Who are you? - Be quiet.

825
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:39,098
You lost her?

826
00:57:39,472 --> 00:57:42,107
It's past curfew, so she can't have left the Capital.

827
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,412
Find her at all cost.

828
00:57:43,413 --> 00:57:44,678
- Yes, Boss. - Yes, Boss.

829
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:49,778
Just wait until I get you.

830
00:57:50,152 --> 00:57:53,178
I'll break your wrist so you never draw again.

831
00:57:53,222 --> 00:57:55,388
Can this woman be...

832
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:01,087
Who are you?

833
00:58:01,192 --> 00:58:04,432
Let me ask you something. Did you see a girl run by?

834
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:06,227
A girl?

835
00:58:06,532 --> 00:58:08,631
May I look inside the litter?

836
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:10,028
Let's go, Man Soo.

837
00:58:10,942 --> 00:58:12,702
Yes, sir. Let's go!

838
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:14,611
Okay. One, two.

839
00:58:14,612 --> 00:58:15,707
Wait.

840
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:17,611
What do you want?

841
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:20,477
I need to see the face of the person inside.

842
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:23,281
Do you know who this is?

843
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,647
What's going on?

844
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:27,647
It's nothing, sir.

845
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,892
- You should just... - Sir.

846
00:58:30,893 --> 00:58:32,421
I don't know who you are,

847
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:34,832
but I'm looking for a servant girl who ran off.

848
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,631
I'm sure she went this way.

849
00:58:36,632 --> 00:58:38,028
I looked all around...

850
00:58:40,802 --> 00:58:42,497
I'm the only one inside.

851
00:58:42,503 --> 00:58:45,997
I cannot let you go until I see for myself.

852
00:58:46,072 --> 00:58:47,207
You can't...

853
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:54,948
Open at your own peril.

854
00:58:56,052 --> 00:58:57,348
Red eyes?

855
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:02,917
This litter belongs to His Majesty the King.

856
00:59:03,893 --> 00:59:05,817
Do you know what that means?

857
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:16,102
It was ignorant of me to disturb you.

858
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:17,372
You got lucky.

859
00:59:17,373 --> 00:59:19,537
If you had opened the window,

860
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:22,372
you would have lost your life.

861
00:59:22,373 --> 00:59:23,638
Let's go, Man Soo.

862
00:59:24,713 --> 00:59:25,937
Let's go.

863
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:28,977
Step aside.

864
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,957
Thank you. You saved me.

865
00:59:48,373 --> 00:59:50,267
Were you very startled?

866
00:59:50,942 --> 00:59:52,497
My heart almost stopped.

867
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:56,341
My heart almost stopped too when I saw a man in a litter...

868
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,308
when I expected a woman.

869
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:03,252
I only ride litters because I cannot see.

870
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:04,348
Pardon?

871
01:00:07,152 --> 01:00:08,787
I see.

872
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:17,258
Why did you help me?

873
01:00:17,703 --> 01:00:20,801
What if I really were a servant girl on the run?

874
01:00:20,802 --> 01:00:23,202
You smell of ink,

875
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,441
so you can't be a servant.

876
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:27,241
A servant wouldn't have thought of jumping into someone else's litter.

877
01:00:27,242 --> 01:00:30,207
I thought you must've had a reason.

878
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:36,107
You're right. I'm a painter.

879
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:38,122
You're truly impressive.

880
01:00:38,123 --> 01:00:39,417
Not at all.

881
01:00:39,453 --> 01:00:43,348
I cannot see, so I observe with smells and sounds.

882
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:45,721
Were you waiting for someone?

883
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:47,258
It's very late.

884
01:00:48,163 --> 01:00:49,357
Actually,

885
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:52,798
they were chasing me from the start.

886
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:56,298
What happened that made you so desperate?

887
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:01,937
That fool conned me.

888
01:01:02,143 --> 01:01:04,037
He's the worst.

889
01:01:04,313 --> 01:01:07,678
Have you heard of Wolseongdang on Woonjong Street?

890
01:01:08,813 --> 01:01:09,881
I'm not sure.

891
01:01:09,882 --> 01:01:13,452
It's an art studio known for selling expensive paintings,

892
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:16,392
but the truth is, they're a rotten bunch...

893
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:18,861
that sell copies for the real deal to make a profit.

894
01:01:18,862 --> 01:01:21,691
He conned me and took my money,

895
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:23,988
and I got back at him for it.

896
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:26,702
I saw him get arrested and taken away.

897
01:01:26,703 --> 01:01:28,497
He got out so soon.

898
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:30,567
Oh, right.

899
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:33,537
Ilwolseong. He must've gotten him out.

900
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:35,241
I heard he was dangerous.

901
01:01:35,242 --> 01:01:37,381
- Ilwolseong? - Yes.

902
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:40,337
He's the worst of them all, and very dangerous too.

903
01:01:40,442 --> 01:01:44,578
Anyone who knows his identity ends up getting killed off.

904
01:01:46,753 --> 01:01:48,921
I think I heard of him,

905
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:51,462
but isn't he knowledgeable and virtuous...

906
01:01:51,463 --> 01:01:52,618
What?

907
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:54,491
That sounds as preposterous...

908
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:56,591
as a date getting struck by lightning on a clear day.

909
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:59,058
That's not true at all.

910
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:04,267
Are you...

911
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:06,638
Ilwolseong...

912
01:02:10,472 --> 01:02:12,877
I mean, you're not his friend, are you?

913
01:02:14,253 --> 01:02:16,308
- As if I would be. - Good.

914
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:20,118
Why would you tease me? My heart almost stopped.

915
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:22,317
Here it is.

916
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,591
That's great. Why did you tease me?

917
01:02:25,592 --> 01:02:27,528
My heart almost sank.

918
01:02:28,293 --> 01:02:31,631
Why does she remind me of her?

919
01:02:31,632 --> 01:02:33,002
The road's uneven from here.

920
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,167
- Okay. - Okay.

921
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:46,877
Your eyes...

922
01:02:47,813 --> 01:02:50,607
are really beautiful.

923
01:02:51,722 --> 01:02:54,448
They're like red jewels.

924
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:03,957
Are you okay?

925
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:06,598
Yes, I'm fine.

926
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:12,098
No one has said that to me before.

927
01:03:12,472 --> 01:03:14,468
People see my eyes...

928
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:16,607
and call me a freak.

929
01:03:16,742 --> 01:03:17,781
What?

930
01:03:17,782 --> 01:03:20,238
About such beautiful eyes?

931
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:23,381
They're the prettiest eyes I've ever seen.

932
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,618
I mean it.

933
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:26,718
- Oh, dear. - Gosh.

934
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:53,107
Are you all right? It's so rocky.

935
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,948
Sir?

936
01:04:03,393 --> 01:04:05,022
What's wrong?

937
01:04:05,023 --> 01:04:07,017
Do you feel unwell?

938
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:20,202
I need you to get out.

939
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:21,337
Pardon?

940
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:22,941
Just like that?

941
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,381
Man Soo, stop the litter.

942
01:04:25,382 --> 01:04:26,607
Pardon?

943
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:29,281
Yes, sir. Put down the litter.

944
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,448
Sir.

945
01:04:41,933 --> 01:04:45,058
Sir, can you tell me your name?

946
01:04:47,003 --> 01:04:50,497
- Let's go now, Man Soo. - Yes, Sir Scholar.

947
01:04:52,143 --> 01:04:53,298
"Scholar"?

948
01:04:54,342 --> 01:04:55,767
Get back safely.

949
01:04:58,083 --> 01:04:59,083
Let's go.

950
01:04:59,084 --> 01:05:00,977
One, two, three.

951
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:04,517
Wait, sir! Can I know your name?

952
01:05:05,353 --> 01:05:06,578
Sir...

953
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,857
She'll be okay on her own at night, won't she?

954
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:22,667
The Capital's very close, but still.

955
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:24,567
What?

956
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:36,377
How could he tell me to get out just like that?

957
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:44,287
I wonder what happened to Nuisance and Frown.

958
01:05:54,672 --> 01:05:56,131
Why is he moving so much?

959
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:59,341
Will you hold on tight? The road's rough as it is.

960
01:05:59,342 --> 01:06:00,968
The litter's shaking.

961
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:06,778
This is a bit serious.

962
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:08,348
Stand still.

963
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:13,122
Put down the litter.

964
01:06:13,123 --> 01:06:14,517
Do it, now!

965
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:50,218
Sir, you're okay, aren't you?

966
01:07:13,282 --> 01:07:14,678
Sir.

967
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,618
What is that?

968
01:07:58,922 --> 01:08:00,591
It's a ghost.

969
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:03,388
No, it's a freak! The freak!

970
01:08:07,532 --> 01:08:08,768
Sir.

971
01:08:11,142 --> 01:08:12,398
He's gone?

972
01:08:30,123 --> 01:08:31,287
Run!

973
01:08:31,963 --> 01:08:34,058
Go. Get out of here!

974
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:43,027
You made a mistake, Ha Ram.

975
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:46,237
On the Winter Solstice when Yin prevails,

976
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:48,508
you crossed the boundary.

977
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:12,157
I found my eyes.

978
01:09:46,445 --> 01:09:48,614
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

979
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:51,183
Something happened on Mount Inwang.

980
01:09:51,184 --> 01:09:53,583
He fell from the sky...

981
01:09:53,584 --> 01:09:55,053
and passed out.

982
01:09:55,054 --> 01:09:56,954
What do you mean the soldiers died overnight?

983
01:09:56,955 --> 01:09:59,154
The bodies are all listless.

984
01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:00,484
It's very strange.

985
01:10:00,485 --> 01:10:02,223
It's a mark of the Demon.

986
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:04,293
Is this truly a copy?

987
01:10:04,294 --> 01:10:06,623
Find the cheeky copycat painter for me.

988
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:09,330
- Lock her up this instant! - No!

989
01:10:09,764 --> 01:10:11,904
What's the delay when it's Hong Cheon Gi?

990
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:14,204
Her mad father is always outside.

991
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:15,673
Get her right now!

992
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,803
Memories of the girl from the peach orchard...

993
01:10:18,804 --> 01:10:20,343
keep overlapping with her.

994
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:21,569
Who are you?
