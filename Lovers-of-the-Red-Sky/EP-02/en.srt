(Lovers of the Red Sky)

3
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:56,693
Due to the Demon's temptation,

4
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,163
so many people had to shed their blood.

5
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,133
I gained more power as the king,

6
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:10,872
but karma was always there to haunt me.

7
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,643
I will take on all the karma.

8
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,512
I want you to seal the Demon

9
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:25,883
and do your best to avoid...

10
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,693
the consequences.

11
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,922
I will do as you say, Father.

12
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:35,762
Have you found traces of the Demon?

13
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,902
It has disappeared.

14
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:39,803
The Demon...

15
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:42,273
never dies.

16
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,842
Sealing it is the only way...

17
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,172
Father!

18
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:52,312
Father!

19
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,792
Restore the king's portrait as soon as possible...

20
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:03,563
so that we can seal the Demon once again.

21
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:05,762
Yes, Your Majesty.

22
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,361
But before we do that,

23
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,302
we must find an artist who can restore the portrait.

24
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,701
An artist who can portray divinity...

25
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:16,071
so that the spirit of the Demon can be sealed.

26
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:19,103
I am talking about artists like Gan Yong Guk and Hong Eun O.

27
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,082
Find me an artist...

28
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:30,922
no matter what.

29
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:32,753
Yes, Your Majesty.

(19 years later, 31st year of King Seongjo)

33
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,902
- Look. - Goodness.

34
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:29,973
Let us go see.

35
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:32,343
How beautiful.

36
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,872
Gosh, my heart is fluttering.

37
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:45,051
My heart beats so fast just by watching.

38
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,552
If your heart beats that fast just by looking at a painting,

39
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:50,922
you should go see a doctor.

40
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:54,292
- Hello. - I am sorry.

41
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:55,792
Hurry.

42
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,941
Among many different types of Sehwa paintings,

43
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:07,143
let us learn about "The Old Man of the South Pole."

44
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,643
What is most important when it comes to Sehwa paintings?

45
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:17,153
Obviously to finish it by the due date.

46
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,492
Otherwise, no one will buy it.

47
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:22,791
- She is right. - That is correct.

48
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,163
She has a point.

49
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,723
Finishing it quickly...

50
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,432
is not the most important thing when it comes to Sehwa paintings.

51
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,973
How short this man is. The deer he is riding.

52
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,973
The protruding head.

53
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:41,672
You must portray these exact characteristics.

54
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,643
That is how you form a lucky omen.

55
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:48,512
You made an excellent choice by hiring him...

56
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,083
as today's lecturer.

57
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,722
Choi Jung, a painter from Gohwawon,

58
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,853
came here to teach them himself.

59
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:57,922
No lecture would be better for the painters.

60
00:05:58,163 --> 00:05:59,422
My goodness.

61
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:01,792
You fool.

62
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,403
You need to do more than just copy the paintings.

63
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,102
When it comes to Sehwa paintings, it is most important...

64
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,643
to use clear colours and portray joy in the paintings.

65
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,871
In other words, you must portray people's longing desire...

66
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,171
to be blessed with luck, joy,

67
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:19,513
happiness, and beauty.

68
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:22,453
She really is something.

69
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:25,453
Painter Hong, if you are done,

70
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,152
stop causing trouble and just leave.

71
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,853
I was going to leave.

72
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:37,603
- Master Choi. - Gosh, you startled me.

73
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,333
Uncle Chun Bok, here you go.

74
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,203
I need to go somewhere. I will be right back.

75
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,672
Where are you going at this hour, young lady?

76
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,682
Where is she going every night?

77
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:56,153
Probably to the market to meet Hong Eun O.

78
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:01,323
Chun Bok, do you know something?

79
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,892
Do you know how long she has been taking care of her father?

80
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:06,222
Yes, 20 years.

81
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,631
You already told me dozens of times.

82
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,032
So you do not need to remind me...

83
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:13,131
She was just a little girl...

84
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,532
who couldn't see a thing.

85
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,842
One rainy day, her vision returned...

86
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:21,013
and told me she needs to make money to take care of her father.

87
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:24,912
She asked me to teach her how to paint...

88
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:28,582
and said she will chop firewood and do the dishes.

89
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,621
The skies must have been touched by her filial devotion...

90
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:33,182
and gave her sight back.

91
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,952
And just like her father,

92
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:38,592
she not only quickly learned how to paint,

93
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:41,862
but she was also very talented.

94
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,732
I could not help but care for...

95
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,273
her.

96
00:08:57,973 --> 00:08:59,843
Look at how handsome he is.

97
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,412
There is more to him than that. He is also a gentleman.

98
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:05,412
I heard he is favoured by His Majesty.

99
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,882
Look at him glow.

100
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,793
What is going on? What is all the fuss about?

101
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,092
You know why.

102
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,063
Scholar Ha is on duty tonight.

103
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:22,231
But then again, even I think...

104
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:24,662
he is as handsome as I am.

105
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:29,603
At the end of the day, he is blind. They are unbelievable.

106
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,741
- By the way, - Yes?

107
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:33,542
I heard Scholar Ha was the helper...

108
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,011
of the rain making ritual that took place 19 years ago.

109
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,012
Yes.

110
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,982
Did he really lose his sight that day?

111
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:40,751
Yes, that is correct.

112
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:43,683
That was when it finally rained in nine years.

113
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,922
Is that why he is called the guarding spirit of this place?

114
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:49,092
What are you talking about?

115
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,762
He is nothing but a freak.

116
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,703
Scholar Ha is here.

117
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:03,473
Hello, Scholar Ha.

118
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,142
- Hello. - Hello.

119
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:06,842
Let us begin the observation.

120
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:08,372
We will begin with the Vermilion Bird of the South.

121
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,982
We will begin with the Vermilion Bird of the South.

122
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,241
- Yes. - Yes.

123
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:13,683
Let us begin the observation.

124
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,382
The fifth star is extremely bright today.

125
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,693
Someone special will come from the east.

126
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,142
Who are you people?

127
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:21,853
You are here.

128
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,022
They are my pals. Come on in.

129
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,323
- What took you so long? - I am sorry.

130
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:38,632
The swirling clouds surrounding the peak of the mountain.

131
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,402
The pointy pine tree branches.

132
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:44,173
Is this...

133
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,603
the original painting?

134
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,912
You really do have an eye for art.

135
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:57,822
I guess Wolseongdang really does buy and sell rare artwork.

136
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,922
What would happen if it gets torn...

137
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:01,053
Stop.

138
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:04,662
Do not even touch it. It is worth four houses.

139
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,992
What? Four houses?

140
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,402
I am finally done.

141
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:15,732
Hey, take a look. What do you think?

142
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:21,012
You really are talented.

143
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,672
You actually copied that.

144
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,082
You made it look just like the original copy.

145
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,012
What are the virtues of making imitations?

146
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:31,952
First, copy the techniques.

147
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:34,922
Second, portray the energy in the original work.

148
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:38,392
Third, it needs to be exactly the same.

149
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:43,933
Will you stop being so arrogant?

150
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,103
Okay, fine.

151
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,972
I bet you my precious brush...

152
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:54,172
that not even Prince Yangmyeong, the lover of arts,

153
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,641
will not be able to notice that mine is an imitation.

154
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,683
Really?

155
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:04,582
My gosh, why did they have to build the storage here?

156
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,481
I will never come back here again.

157
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,193
Did you guys ever hear about...

158
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:10,892
the owner of Wolseongdang?

159
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:12,161
Ilwolseong?

160
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:14,962
He is known to be the richest man in Guanyang.

161
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,963
The most famous merchant in this country.

162
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,531
That makes sense seeing that he was able to buy "Sochundo."

163
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,672
That is not all.

164
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:24,271
There are tons of original artworks in Wolseongdang.

165
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:25,272
You are right.

166
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:28,973
There is another big secret.

167
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,411
If you write a question...

168
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,641
and put it inside the box in front of Wolseongdang,

169
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,381
Ilwolseong writes you back...

170
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,822
saying you will have to pay a price for the answer.

171
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:42,352
In other words, Ilwolseong is an informant...

172
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:45,063
who knows everything.

173
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,391
But you must be careful.

174
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:53,102
Apparently, no one has ever seen his face.

175
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:55,102
He speaks from an adjoining room,

176
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,672
and you can only hear his voice...

177
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:58,943
that does not sound like it belongs to a human.

178
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,943
And they say whoever sees his face...

179
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:05,382
will get beheaded.

180
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,882
You and that darn mouth of yours.

181
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:12,723
Do not believe him. Half of what he says is a lie.

182
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:16,453
What? Does that mean you believe me half of the time?

183
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,362
Unfortunately, I am not even interested in the other half.

184
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:20,762
Ilwolseong?

185
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,662
Hey, wait up.

186
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,922
Yoo Si Hong, the younger brother of Yeon's emperor,

187
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,252
is coming here as a messenger?

188
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,552
That is unusual.

189
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:52,722
Is there a special reason why...

190
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,862
you chose to work at Jangwangjang today?

191
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,761
According to the stars last night,

192
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,132
someone special will come today from the east.

193
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:02,573
The entrance of Jangwangjang is facing the east.

194
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:04,703
Can you guess whom it might be?

195
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,282
I am not sure.

196
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,813
I wonder whom that special person will be.

197
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:19,683
Hello.

198
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,593
Jung, are you there?

199
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,723
Goodness, look who is here. It is Painter Hong.

200
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,661
I would like to get paid first.

201
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,333
First, let me take a look at the painting.

202
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:34,531
It is hard to tell which one is the original copy.

203
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,432
This is why I like you.

204
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:40,203
How should I put it? You have no pride as a painter.

205
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:43,213
They both look exactly the same.

206
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,682
Is that a compliment?

207
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:45,812
It is a great compliment.

208
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:48,011
Most painters who draw imitations...

209
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:50,582
try very hard to leave a trace of their identity.

210
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,121
They are not even an aristocrat.

211
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:55,391
Those painters also think of imitations as their work.

212
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:56,923
I did not know that.

213
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,762
Here you go.

214
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,362
Let me check.

215
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,833
It is the right amount.

216
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,412
What is this?

217
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,641
It is my gesture of gratitude.

218
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,083
Gosh, why are you acting like you are going to quit?

219
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:23,583
That is right. I have earned enough money for my father's medicine.

220
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:28,693
Thus, that is going to be my last imitation.

221
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,923
Keep quiet about all my works as you have promised.

222
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,463
You are quitting?

223
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:40,563
Well, okay.

224
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:42,272
Painter Hong.

225
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:47,241
Drawing imitations is very hard to quit.

226
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,012
It is like a drug.

227
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,622
What is with you guys?

228
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,553
What is with us?

229
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:05,593
Do you really not know?

230
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,833
We favoured you and treated you like a real painter,

231
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:11,932
and that must have caused you to become arrogant.

232
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:14,772
Let me see.

233
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:17,743
I cannot hurt your wrist.

234
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,642
Are you threatening me?

235
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,012
Have you forgotten who I am?

236
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,022
Of course not. You are the only female painter in this city.

237
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,652
The only female of the Baekyu Painters Society.

238
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:37,691
What do you think this will do to the reputation of Wolseongdang...

239
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,392
that is known to be the best art studio?

240
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:45,401
What? Are you going to cut me with that?

241
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,563
Go ahead.

242
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:48,172
Wait.

243
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:51,843
Here is my wrist.

244
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,692
You are bolder than most men.

245
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,132
You are wiser than most men.

246
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:19,662
Leave before I change my mind.

247
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:24,003
You had better not change your mind.

248
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,702
What are you doing?

249
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:05,112
Is there someone here?

250
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,053
What is with you? I told you to leave.

251
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:11,922
Do not talk nonsense and just go.

252
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,692
Okay.

253
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:20,493
I will be off now. Thank you for everything.

254
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:22,632
Goodbye to you too.

255
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,371
Are you really going to let her leave?

256
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:30,672
Just get ready to go to the capital city.

257
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,471
The lord in Bukchon-Ri is waiting for us.

258
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,313
Do not get it mixed with the original artwork.

259
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,492
Goodness, the colour is so beautiful.

260
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,792
Do you see that?

261
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:55,793
This colour comes from a turtle that lived for 10,000 years.

262
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:58,901
A turtle with a gold shell and a yellow neck.

263
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:02,132
It is a medicine that was made with a 10,000-year-old ingredient.

264
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,603
Unless it's a real 10,000-year gold turtle pill,

265
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,702
it can't be this colour.

266
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,712
Okay.

267
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,283
I like it.

268
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:25,822
If you take just one of these pills,

269
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:28,592
from the moment you take it, its effects...

270
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:29,993
slowly start to show.

271
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,232
Is that true? That's it, then.

272
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,632
I can finally cure my dad's madness.

273
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:46,082
No, it's fine. No discounts.

274
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,483
You'll jinx the medicine.

275
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,911
I won't haggle. 50 Yang.

276
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:53,181
Fights should be stopped and deals should be made.

277
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:57,053
No, I want to take this pill with its effects and everything.

278
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,823
Here you go.

279
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,432
Fifty Yang of silver.

280
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,033
You can check.

281
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,743
- I'll go, then. - Sure.

282
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:16,813
Thank you.

283
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:21,682
- Come and take a look! - Take a look!

284
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:34,422
Dad, it's me, Cheon Gi.

285
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,402
Cheon Gi?

286
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:42,233
My Cheon Gi's still a baby.

287
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:47,043
Today's work looks pretty good.

288
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:48,942
Can you draw me?

289
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,513
Of course.

290
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:09,232
Mister, since yesterday,

291
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:12,932
you only made hoes, sickles, and plows, didn't you?

292
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:16,972
I hear round, low sounds like my hands.

293
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,472
Do you know how much I looked for you?

294
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,013
I told you where I'd be.

295
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:30,013
Did you forget again, Dad?

296
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,353
What?

297
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:45,033
Your drawings are really nice.

298
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:48,573
To pay you for the drawing,

299
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:51,503
I will give you this.

300
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,172
Open your mouth.

301
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:09,523
What are you doing?

302
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:12,121
My Cheon Gi will be hungry too.

303
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:14,523
I didn't give her much for breakfast.

304
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:20,502
I brought more than enough food.

305
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,773
You can eat it all.

306
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,313
Dad.

307
00:23:29,372 --> 00:23:31,212
You can eat it all.

308
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,553
I also have...

309
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,422
something very precious.

310
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:49,263
What's that?

311
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:51,293
Eat this too.

312
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:55,171
When you eat this, you must smell it first,

313
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,402
and then taste it when it's in your mouth.

314
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,402
You must savour it twice.

315
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:01,642
Here.

316
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:11,652
What is this?

317
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,853
It's my everything.

318
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:28,033
I hope you can say, "Hong Cheon Gi, my daughter,"

319
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:32,273
and hold my brush with me like before.

320
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:37,112
And scold me not to paint copies again.

321
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:41,142
I'd like you to tell me that painting without heart...

322
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:42,983
is of no use.

323
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,122
What a smell.

324
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:55,862
She didn't catch on, did she?

325
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,533
She's a very bright kid.

326
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,303
We made sure she didn't notice a thing.

327
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:02,432
Here.

328
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:06,672
- Let's go. - Wait.

329
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:12,243
Please, can I have the deeds to my home back?

330
00:25:13,142 --> 00:25:15,882
The house was in my family for three generations.

331
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,563
Who told you to offer a human sacrifice?

332
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,733
I did it on my own.

333
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:36,372
Kill me if you must, Your Majesty.

334
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,942
It wouldn't have rained if not for the human sacrifice.

335
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:46,512
The public would've resented it even more,

336
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:48,513
and the government would've been in distress.

337
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:50,612
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

338
00:25:58,263 --> 00:25:59,793
It rained,

339
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,033
so I will spare you your life.

340
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:05,303
As soon as day breaks,

341
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:07,503
you are to leave the Palace.

342
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:09,073
And...

343
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:11,743
never return even in death.

344
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:16,612
Your Majesty, I pray for your health.

345
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:25,583
The Prince has come to see you.

346
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:29,052
It seems like it was just yesterday...

347
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:31,152
that you came to me after Father sent you away.

348
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,093
That was 20 years ago already.

349
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:38,931
You haven't forgotten your vow, have you?

350
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,603
How could I?

351
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:42,573
That day,

352
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,402
I said I did not find you.

353
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,372
I said the heavens had picked you.

354
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,982
Yes. When will that time come?

355
00:26:51,983 --> 00:26:53,543
The undying.

356
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:57,211
When you accept the power of the Demon who presides over death,

357
00:26:57,212 --> 00:26:59,122
then your time will come.

358
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:01,651
How many years have you been saying that?

359
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:04,553
Compared to the deities, humans live just for a moment.

360
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,263
Their time flows unlike ours.

361
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:09,593
Try not to be so impatient.

362
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,701
Isn't that a white crow?

363
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,372
A good omen that comes every 1,000 years.

364
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:23,343
It was found dead in a mountain not long ago.

365
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:27,912
In the near future, a huge mishap will come upon us.

366
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:29,313
A mishap?

367
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:37,753
Father.

368
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:41,023
Will I really be able to see again?

369
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:45,063
Yes. Don't worry at all.

370
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:49,932
Om Mani padme hum.

371
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,402
Om Mani padme hum.

372
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:54,942
Om...

373
00:27:58,882 --> 00:28:00,112
It has been a while.

374
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:04,212
You're...

375
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:09,253
Investigator Kim Gong Rae?

376
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,753
Investigator?

377
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:14,392
If you had died when you went over that cliff,

378
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:17,132
I would not have had to do this.

379
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:20,461
Why are you doing this?

380
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:23,471
Over ten years have passed since the late king's command.

381
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:25,502
Even if 100 years have passed, it must be carried out.

382
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,503
The king's command?

383
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,111
I risked my life to seal the Demon,

384
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:32,042
and my son lost his sight to bring us rain!

385
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,412
Is this what we get in return?

386
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:38,182
Father!

387
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,221
No!

388
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:47,361
- Father! - No!

389
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:49,793
- You can't take them! - Father!

390
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:51,661
- Father! - Son!

391
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:53,532
You're taking my husband's body...

392
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,401
and my son as well?

393
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:56,631
It's the King's command.

394
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:59,103
- Mother! - Ha Ram!

395
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,073
Do you wish to die too?

396
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,212
No. Mother!

397
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,392
That day,

398
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,962
you killed three people.

399
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,493
I will make you...

400
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,833
pay for the price of bloodshed.

401
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,503
I swear.

402
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:33,671
You're late, Moo Young.

403
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,111
We got a pigeon from the Palace.

404
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:38,172
- Is it about the Crown Prince? - Yes.

405
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:40,782
He was travelling to a hot spring...

406
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,353
when he was attacked by assassins.

407
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,151
Who's behind it?

408
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,253
Wolseongdang sent out their informants.

409
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,823
We should hear soon.

410
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:51,093
But then,

411
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:54,023
the King has been sick for a while.

412
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:56,232
The Crown Prince is sickly,

413
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:59,932
so it's the perfect timing for those who want to take power.

414
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:01,803
It seems that...

415
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,172
the time has come for me too.

416
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:13,813
We're about to have an important guest tonight.

417
00:30:14,043 --> 00:30:15,752
I'm sorry for the trouble, Moo Young.

418
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:16,783
Yes, my lord.

419
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:28,993
My lord, it's another bull's eye.

420
00:30:30,593 --> 00:30:33,461
I hear that the Crown Prince was attacked...

421
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:36,432
during his trip to the hot spring.

422
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:41,372
Was it done by a treasonous group...

423
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:44,112
that wish to overturn the royal authority?

424
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,313
I can't seem to go to sleep.

425
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,122
It's too early to jump to a conclusion.

426
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:58,662
However, if you're still worried,

427
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:02,392
it might not be a bad idea to meet with Ilwolseong.

428
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,093
Ilwolseong?

429
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:08,063
Yes, he's a man with wisdom and information of Zhuge Liang.

430
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,672
Why haven't I heard of this man...

431
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,171
until today?

432
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,641
I apologize, my lord.

433
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:17,371
He's a very careful and secretive man,

434
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:20,813
so no one has heard his voice or seen his face to this day.

435
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,212
So you weren't lying.

436
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:29,822
No, I wasn't. How would I dare to lie before you?

437
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,823
If what you said is true,

438
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:38,432
then don't we need him even if we must ask him three times or more?

439
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:40,333
Where can I meet him?

440
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:44,472
You'll find his request box in the middle of the city.

441
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:03,322
My name is Moo Young of Wolseongdang.

442
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,023
I came to take the request.

443
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,361
Lead us to your master.

444
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:11,691
I'm here with a nobleman. Do delay this any further.

445
00:32:11,692 --> 00:32:16,232
I apologize, but my master does not show himself to anybody.

446
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:19,572
How dare you speak like that before him?

447
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:24,542
However, he already expected to meet the Prince tonight.

448
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,242
If you do not pry into his identity,

449
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,382
- you'll get the answer you want... - How dare you?

450
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,493
I understand.

451
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:43,161
Your Highness.

452
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:46,362
It's all right. I completely understand...

453
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:52,603
the wish of Ilwolseong.

454
00:32:57,612 --> 00:33:00,382
In 7 days, 23rd period, at Simcheonggak.

455
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:02,212
From Ilwolseong.

456
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,013
Ilwolseong.

457
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,422
- Come and take a look. - Come and get what you need!

458
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:23,533
No, I asked you to draw me something to put up on my gates.

459
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:26,401
What on earth are you drawing? What is this?

460
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:29,813
Darn it, what a fraud. Darn it.

461
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,543
Hey, did you get anything done?

462
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:37,853
You're here.

463
00:33:38,112 --> 00:33:40,553
Did you get that medicine you were talking about?

464
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:42,323
Yes, I did.

465
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:44,293
So how was it?

466
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,993
Can't you tell?

467
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:50,762
Her eyes look completely empty,

468
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,362
so she must've been scammed again.

469
00:33:56,472 --> 00:34:00,372
Hey! Didn't I always tell you that you'd better watch your mouth?

470
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,293
I'll take this drawing.

471
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:19,523
I can't.

472
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:24,732
Don't be like that. Give me this drawing.

473
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:25,963
No.

474
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:30,832
I'll give you a good price, so just give it to me.

475
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,172
No, I can't.

476
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,201
Give it to me. You're going to rip it.

477
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:36,613
- Old lady, what's wrong? - Let go. It'll get ripped.

478
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:38,142
I'll have it.

479
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:40,883
Doesn't it look nice?

480
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,213
- Goodness. - Give it to me.

481
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:53,262
Anyway, it looks like you might get on a litter soon.

482
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:56,162
Sorry?

483
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:02,402
Don't worry about it. It's for a great occasion.

484
00:35:02,403 --> 00:35:03,872
Wait, old lady!

485
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,613
Dad.

486
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:16,813
It's me, Dad. Your daughter, Cheon Gi.

487
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:22,592
Do you want me to draw you something?

488
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,883
Oh no.

489
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:52,153
Don't stand there in the rain. Get in here.

490
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:02,563
Right, my daughter.

491
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:04,762
Dad.

492
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:07,531
This is just a shower. It'll stop soon.

493
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,502
Let me go. My daughter can't even see.

494
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,902
She probably can't avoid the rain in this cold weather.

495
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:16,472
Then I'll bring her, so wait here.

496
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,713
All right, then.

497
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:23,011
She's about this tall.

498
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,312
And she has a stick, right?

499
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:25,353
Yes.

500
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:27,153
All right.

501
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,221
Don't go anywhere. Sit here and wait for me.

502
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,822
I'll bring her.

503
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,613
About Cheon Gi.

504
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,943
I don't feel so comfortable...

505
00:36:54,983 --> 00:36:56,713
about deceiving that poor girl.

506
00:36:57,153 --> 00:37:00,883
Watch your mouth. Our lives are at stake too.

507
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:04,721
We just need to turn a blind eye to this.

508
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,762
Goodness, you foolish man. Why did you get into gambling?

509
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:14,202
Even if she realizes that she bought fake medicine,

510
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:19,443
we cannot be the ones who spill the truth of the matter.

511
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:27,483
Cheon Gi.

512
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:30,912
What did you just say? Deceiving me?

513
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,293
What do you mean by that?

514
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:43,031
I'm sorry, Cheon Gi.

515
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:45,762
What in the world are you talking about?

516
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,613
My lord, you're here.

517
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:02,353
Why did you drink so much?

518
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,782
My love, my precious.

519
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:17,431
Darn it, you shameless man.

520
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:18,432
My gosh!

521
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,103
Where's the exit?

522
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:22,903
Stop right there!

523
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,503
Hey! Stop right there!

524
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,113
Stop right there!

525
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:32,182
- Hey! - I have no idea!

526
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:34,583
Stop right there!

527
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,512
Hey! You shameless jerk!

528
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,083
- Hey! - Move aside!

529
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:44,753
Goodness!

530
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:46,321
Do you know what that money is worth?

531
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:50,091
I wanted to help my dad, so I saved up that money...

532
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:53,632
without eating, spending, and even getting criticized!

533
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:56,102
Did you wish to live after doing something like this?

534
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:57,571
Give me my money back!

535
00:38:57,572 --> 00:38:58,833
Stop right there!

536
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,842
Give me my money!

537
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:04,812
My gosh, she's one feisty woman.

538
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:06,042
Stop right there, you jerk!

539
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,281
Wait, move aside.

540
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:08,512
My money!

541
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,713
What's going on?

542
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:17,452
It looks like there is a ruckus here.

543
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,092
Goodness, Hoo.

544
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,302
It's great to run into you in a place like this.

545
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:28,432
Yes, Yul.

546
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,632
Were you writing poems with other scholars here?

547
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:32,673
Yes.

548
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:36,341
Nice to meet you. My name is Mae Hyang.

549
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,772
You're Mae Hyang, the flower of Simcheonggak.

550
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:42,282
You must be Prince Joohyang. I've heard so much about you.

551
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,653
You can all meet later.

552
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:50,392
I'm glad you came. You should join us.

553
00:39:52,153 --> 00:39:55,222
I'll have to postpone it.

554
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:57,492
I have an urgent engagement.

555
00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:02,971
You're always so serious. We never have any fun.

556
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,402
How do you always remain the same?

557
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,971
People say they'll die if they suddenly change.

558
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:12,483
Goodness, this isn't the only day for us.

559
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:15,712
You'll be holding a painting contest soon.

560
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,352
The two of us can spend...

561
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:18,952
all night drinking together.

562
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,182
What?

563
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,822
Will you really come, Hoo?

564
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,022
It looks like this contest will go down in history.

565
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:31,063
Then I hope you all have fun.

566
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,733
Goodbye, Hoo.

567
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:51,281
Are you Ilwolseong?

568
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,622
Yes, my lord. Please take a seat.

569
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:55,383
Sure.

570
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:02,693
Did you read through the request?

571
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,932
"There was a precious jade in green in a place beyond anyone's reach."

572
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:14,342
"Recently, a night prowler has come and tried to steal the jade."

573
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:18,043
"Was it just a petty thief who was blinded by the jade?"

574
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,782
"Or was it a big thief who put out his life..."

575
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,282
"because he knew its worth?"

576
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:25,483
Yes. Do you understand...

577
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,153
my concern?

578
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:32,693
The green jade must be a jade marble.

579
00:41:32,963 --> 00:41:36,193
In other words, it's your brother, the Crown Prince's realm.

580
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:38,262
The unreachable place must be the sky.

581
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,963
In a nutshell, this means the Crown Prince's palace.

582
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,103
And?

583
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:46,943
If this was a petty thief,

584
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,372
you wouldn't have stepped up yourself.

585
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:52,782
I'm sure it's a big thief.

586
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:56,253
Such a thief believes he's a big, nobleman.

587
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,452
And a man like that...

588
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,722
reached out to the unreachable sky,

589
00:42:03,592 --> 00:42:05,353
it can only mean treason.

590
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:10,193
What's your ground for that conclusion?

591
00:42:20,072 --> 00:42:21,572
I heard the Crown Prince...

592
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:26,182
came across an assassin during his trip to the hot spring.

593
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:29,613
Was this found on the paper?

594
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:32,722
If that's not a sign of treason,

595
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:35,353
what else could it mean?

596
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:36,552
Are you saying...

597
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:41,363
the incident of that assassin was an act of treason?

598
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,262
Do you...

599
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:44,932
truly wish to know?

600
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:46,102
Speak!

601
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:47,233
In that case,

602
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:49,633
you shouldn't be here talking to me.

603
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:52,673
You should look into a mirror.

604
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:55,972
Wasn't it you, Prince Joohyang,

605
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,282
who sent that assassin his way?

606
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,363
Do you really wish...

607
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:17,292
to die in my hands?

608
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:18,293
If...

609
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:21,133
the power behind this incident comes out to the light,

610
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:25,603
then you, Prince Joohyang, who tested me with this paper,

611
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,472
wouldn't be able to survive.

612
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:48,122
You.

613
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:53,431
No.

614
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:54,903
Have you forgotten?

615
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,603
You promised not to pry into...

616
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:01,403
my identity.

617
00:44:05,572 --> 00:44:07,813
What persuaded Zhuge Liang...

618
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:10,353
wasn't a sword.

619
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:15,452
I do not believe you're an impatient man,

620
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,122
because you still...

621
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:21,023
let the current king live in peace and safety.

622
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:26,302
You will...

623
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:31,403
meet me again in good time.

624
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:42,983
This was my test.

625
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:45,113
Your wisdom and boldness are...

626
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:47,023
as great as I've heard, Ilwolseong.

627
00:44:47,322 --> 00:44:49,492
I look forward to the day we meet again.

628
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,032
Should I track him?

629
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:00,662
No.

630
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:03,903
He's not a man who'll kneel before my sword.

631
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,673
- Let's go. - Yes, Your Highness.

632
00:45:23,923 --> 00:45:26,363
You! You fraud!

633
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:30,432
Give me my money. Give me my money back!

634
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:32,531
I don't know anything!

635
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,161
I just did as Jung asked!

636
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:35,972
What? Jung?

637
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:37,572
Is Wolseongdang a part of this too?

638
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,842
It was an organized crime, wasn't it?

639
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:42,842
I don't know anything.

640
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:45,842
Stop right there, you scammer of Wolseongdang!

641
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:50,483
Did I just hear that right?

642
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:54,122
Yes, she clearly said, "You scammer..."

643
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:57,052
"of Wolseongdang!"

644
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,891
Tell Moo Young to find out everything that happened...

645
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:04,162
in Wolseongdang to this day.

646
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:06,032
Yes, my lord.

647
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,362
Let's go, that's it.

648
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:10,602
Yes, did I keep you waiting?

649
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,471
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

650
00:46:12,472 --> 00:46:14,071
It's not like the sun has come up.

651
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,072
What did you say?

652
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,813
Are you saying I become wasted every single day?

653
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:20,113
Anyway,

654
00:46:20,642 --> 00:46:23,052
don't you think you stop by the gisaeng house too often?

655
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:26,182
What can I do? I get conscious of what people think of me.

656
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:27,423
You do?

657
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:30,121
They say my power has grown tremendously big.

658
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:31,552
What power, Your Highness?

659
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:36,192
The problem is that I only associate with the nobleman.

660
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,332
I mean, it's not easy for a prince of a nation...

661
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:42,462
to look this handsome and to have excellent calligraphy.

662
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:44,832
If this handsome prince must live with a misunderstanding...

663
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,371
because of my love for literature and arts,

664
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,742
then I do not mind living my life like this.

665
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,172
I shouldn't have said that.

666
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:54,681
No, you can say that once again.

667
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:57,112
And start over at my handsome looks.

668
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:59,722
The handsome prince...

669
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:09,322
This is why I like you.

670
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:12,162
Jung...

671
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:15,903
Wolseongdang.

672
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:26,641
Hey, what is this?

673
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:29,012
Anyway, what's with your face?

674
00:47:30,952 --> 00:47:33,282
I need your help. Gather round.

675
00:47:34,653 --> 00:47:35,923
What happened is...

676
00:47:39,963 --> 00:47:43,463
Now, this is a painting of a bamboo by Wun Dong of Qing.

677
00:47:43,662 --> 00:47:46,102
I hear this place has the biggest collection...

678
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:48,062
and that you sell the paintings...

679
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:51,132
at a handsome price, so I decided to come by.

680
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:52,372
You're at the right place.

681
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:59,511
That costs over 100 Yang of silver.

682
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:01,883
Be careful. Be very careful with it.

683
00:48:03,912 --> 00:48:05,712
I'll contact you once the painting is sold.

684
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:07,352
You can relax and wait.

685
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:09,822
Roll it up. Careful.

686
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:12,293
To the left. That's it.

687
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:14,592
Is anybody here?

688
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:19,531
What is it?

689
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,431
We heard you copy the paintings people leave here...

690
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,772
and sell them back as if it's the genuine piece.

691
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:26,032
Search through.

692
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:27,242
- Yes. - Yes.

693
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:30,511
Search for what? What are you doing?

694
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:33,282
What is this? Who's trying to frame me like this?

695
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,952
This isn't an imitation. It's the real one.

696
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,083
Painter Choi.

697
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:49,122
He's a painter of junior eighth rank at Gohwawon.

698
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:52,903
He's here to evaluate this to tell us if this is a copy.

699
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,673
It was copied.

700
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:01,201
What kind of nonsense is this?

701
00:49:01,202 --> 00:49:02,702
This isn't a copy!

702
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:06,142
Why is there an insect in a bamboo painting by Wun Dong?

703
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,113
- What? - That's impossible.

704
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:12,052
Also, this paper came from Moonsung, right across the street.

705
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:14,722
Look.

706
00:49:15,923 --> 00:49:17,822
There's the mark for Moonsung.

707
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:20,193
This can't be.

708
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:21,722
This can't be right!

709
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:24,463
- Arrest him. - Yes.

710
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,863
This is unfair. I've been framed!

711
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:28,832
I don't know anything about this.

712
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:30,372
I'm not like that!

713
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,042
It's not a big deal.

714
00:49:33,043 --> 00:49:35,103
I was just there to talk.

715
00:49:35,903 --> 00:49:37,072
It's not a big deal.

716
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,582
It's not a big deal.

717
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,722
- I can't believe that man. - What a shame.

718
00:50:21,983 --> 00:50:23,592
Hong Cheon Gi, you brat. It was you, wasn't it?

719
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:25,321
Are you out of your mind?

720
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:28,161
You'll pay for this! You're just an insect!

721
00:50:28,162 --> 00:50:30,092
I will crush you!

722
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:34,063
That made me feel so much better.

723
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:03,931
Is that good enough?

724
00:51:03,932 --> 00:51:06,702
You should be able to handle most thugs now.

725
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:11,032
Did you ask about the gisaeng house incident?

726
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:15,472
Vice-chief Jung Seon Rye had been making a profit selling copies.

727
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:19,341
A painter who provided the copies wanted to quit,

728
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,141
so he deceived her and took her money.

729
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:23,753
And she found out.

730
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:27,583
Yes, and because of that, Jung Seon Rye was arrested today.

731
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:29,182
Was he?

732
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:32,753
It seems he got caught selling forgeries.

733
00:51:33,492 --> 00:51:37,462
Do you mean he was arrested because of the copycat painter?

734
00:51:37,463 --> 00:51:38,563
Yes.

735
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,301
Close Wolseongdang...

736
00:51:48,302 --> 00:51:51,012
and find the copycat painter to find out more.

737
00:51:56,182 --> 00:51:59,512
My lord, it is time to go to the Palace.

738
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,522
If this was not treason,

739
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:05,122
would anyone have attacked the Crown Prince?

740
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:08,762
Dozens of soldiers failed to catch the assassin.

741
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:11,431
I find that hard to believe.

742
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:12,891
Of the Five Polar Stars within...

743
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:14,402
the Small Purple Custer indicating the palace,

744
00:52:14,403 --> 00:52:16,531
the Crown Prince's star is bright and strong,

745
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:19,943
so you need not worry about his safety.

746
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,242
Is that so?

747
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:28,812
What I wonder is, shouldn't we find out who's threatening us...

748
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,051
and punish them for it?

749
00:52:31,052 --> 00:52:33,221
I heard that when a king causes bloodshed,

750
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:35,753
it stays with the family for a thousand years.

751
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:41,762
You are still concerned about the blood your late father shed.

752
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,762
Times like this is when you must be even more resolute.

753
00:52:46,802 --> 00:52:47,903
Yes.

754
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,333
I should.

755
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:55,003
Come closer.

756
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:07,781
From now on, out of the Five Polar Stars,

757
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:11,023
keep a close eye on the second and third stars that represent...

758
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:13,722
Joohyang and Yangmyeong.

759
00:53:14,063 --> 00:53:17,293
That is my special and secret command to you.

760
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:19,563
I will do as commanded.

761
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:24,302
Do you still have no memory of the past?

762
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:27,372
I do not.

763
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:31,673
I still remember nothing right after the rain making ritual 19 years ago.

764
00:53:33,113 --> 00:53:34,142
However,

765
00:53:36,242 --> 00:53:39,713
sometimes, bits and pieces of my memory return.

766
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:45,722
It's a relief to hear you're making progress.

767
00:53:46,463 --> 00:53:47,492
Yes.

768
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,392
It's a great relief.

769
00:53:59,472 --> 00:54:00,472
Your Majesty.

770
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,713
I may have no memory of that day,

771
00:54:05,572 --> 00:54:07,782
but how could I forget absolutely everything?

772
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,083
Until those who killed my father...

773
00:54:12,613 --> 00:54:16,923
and ruined my family and my life pay the price,

774
00:54:20,863 --> 00:54:23,633
I can never forget...

775
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,903
or stop what I'm doing.

776
00:54:29,662 --> 00:54:31,702
- Are you sure? - Yes.

777
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,273
Boss.

778
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:36,172
What took you so long?

779
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,972
They demanded triple the amount this time.

780
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:43,452
They took triple the bribe and treated me like this?

781
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:45,612
He said you should be grateful they're letting you go.

782
00:54:45,613 --> 00:54:46,782
Don't.

783
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:48,722
Hong Cheon Gi.

784
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:50,722
Where is she?

785
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,992
Good riddance, Jung Seon Rye.

786
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:56,423
The jerk.

787
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,702
Getting revenge doesn't mean I'll get the money back.

788
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:06,503
My gosh.

789
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:16,551
All that happened to you were out of everyone's control.

790
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,213
It wasn't your fault.

791
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:20,983
That random comment...

792
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,793
still offers some comfort.

793
00:55:26,992 --> 00:55:27,992
Yes.

794
00:55:28,322 --> 00:55:29,523
Hey, Nuisance.

795
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:31,932
What do you want now?

796
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:36,031
Wolseongdang Jung Seon Rye conned me out of 50 Yang.

797
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,932
His master Ilwolseong must give me 100 Yang.

798
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:41,472
My gosh.

799
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:44,512
You've been quite busy, Painter Hong.

800
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:47,383
What do you want from...

801
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:48,983
me?

802
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:50,312
What do you think?

803
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,782
You sent me to rot in prison for a while, but I didn't stay long.

804
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:55,423
Oh?

805
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,023
What, 100 Yang?

806
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:03,432
You cheeky thing.

807
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,732
- Shoot. - Darn it. Get her!

808
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:09,063
- After her! - Get her!

809
00:56:11,302 --> 00:56:13,702
- Darn. - Stop!

810
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,512
Oh, no.

811
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:22,681
Boss! Boss!

812
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:25,313
- Boss! - Get up!

813
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,682
Where is she?

814
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,052
Go that way!

815
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,121
Okay.

816
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:32,592
What a brat.

817
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:37,233
Scholar Ha, we reached the gate.

818
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:40,531
I'll show the guard our night time travel permit.

819
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:41,733
Okay.

820
00:56:46,642 --> 00:56:50,372
What? Jung? Is Wolseongdang a part of this too?

821
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:52,043
How did I get involved?

822
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:58,483
I don't know who you are, but please ignore me for now.

823
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,253
But...

824
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,722
- Who are you? - Be quiet.

825
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:38,653
You lost her?

826
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,662
It's past curfew, so she can't have left the Capital.

827
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:43,062
Find her at all cost.

828
00:57:43,063 --> 00:57:44,233
- Yes, Boss. - Yes, Boss.

829
00:57:47,432 --> 00:57:49,333
Just wait until I get you.

830
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:52,733
I'll break your wrist so you never draw again.

831
00:57:52,872 --> 00:57:54,943
Can this woman be...

832
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:00,642
Who are you?

833
00:58:00,842 --> 00:58:04,082
Let me ask you something. Did you see a girl run by?

834
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,782
A girl?

835
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,281
May I look inside the litter?

836
00:58:08,282 --> 00:58:09,583
Let's go, Man Soo.

837
00:58:10,592 --> 00:58:12,352
Yes, sir. Let's go!

838
00:58:12,353 --> 00:58:14,261
Okay. One, two.

839
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:15,262
Wait.

840
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,193
What do you want?

841
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:20,032
I need to see the face of the person inside.

842
00:58:20,202 --> 00:58:22,931
Do you know who this is?

843
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,202
What's going on?

844
00:58:24,932 --> 00:58:27,202
It's nothing, sir.

845
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,542
- You should just... - Sir.

846
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:32,071
I don't know who you are,

847
00:58:32,072 --> 00:58:34,482
but I'm looking for a servant girl who ran off.

848
00:58:34,483 --> 00:58:36,281
I'm sure she went this way.

849
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:37,583
I looked all around...

850
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:42,052
I'm the only one inside.

851
00:58:42,153 --> 00:58:45,552
I cannot let you go until I see for myself.

852
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:46,762
You can't...

853
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,503
Open at your own peril.

854
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:56,903
Red eyes?

855
00:58:58,432 --> 00:59:02,472
This litter belongs to His Majesty the King.

856
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:05,372
Do you know what that means?

857
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:15,752
It was ignorant of me to disturb you.

858
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:17,022
You got lucky.

859
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:19,092
If you had opened the window,

860
00:59:19,753 --> 00:59:21,963
you would have lost your life.

861
00:59:22,023 --> 00:59:23,193
Let's go, Man Soo.

862
00:59:24,363 --> 00:59:25,492
Let's go.

863
00:59:27,432 --> 00:59:28,532
Step aside.

864
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,512
Thank you. You saved me.

865
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:49,822
Were you very startled?

866
00:59:50,592 --> 00:59:52,052
My heart almost stopped.

867
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:55,991
My heart almost stopped too when I saw a man in a litter...

868
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:57,863
when I expected a woman.

869
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:02,902
I only ride litters because I cannot see.

870
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:03,903
Pardon?

871
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:08,342
I see.

872
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:16,813
Why did you help me?

873
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:20,451
What if I really were a servant girl on the run?

874
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:22,852
You smell of ink,

875
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,091
so you can't be a servant.

876
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:26,891
A servant wouldn't have thought of jumping into someone else's litter.

877
01:00:26,892 --> 01:00:29,762
I thought you must've had a reason.

878
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:35,662
You're right. I'm a painter.

879
01:00:36,162 --> 01:00:37,702
You're truly impressive.

880
01:00:37,773 --> 01:00:38,972
Not at all.

881
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:42,903
I cannot see, so I observe with smells and sounds.

882
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:45,313
Were you waiting for someone?

883
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:46,813
It's very late.

884
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:48,912
Actually,

885
01:00:49,543 --> 01:00:52,353
they were chasing me from the start.

886
01:00:52,552 --> 01:00:55,853
What happened that made you so desperate?

887
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:01,492
That fool conned me.

888
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:03,592
He's the worst.

889
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:07,233
Have you heard of Wolseongdang on Woonjong Street?

890
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:09,531
I'm not sure.

891
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:13,102
It's an art studio known for selling expensive paintings,

892
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:16,042
but the truth is, they're a rotten bunch...

893
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:18,511
that sell copies for the real deal to make a profit.

894
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:21,341
He conned me and took my money,

895
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:23,543
and I got back at him for it.

896
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,352
I saw him get arrested and taken away.

897
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,052
He got out so soon.

898
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,122
Oh, right.

899
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,092
Ilwolseong. He must've gotten him out.

900
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,891
I heard he was dangerous.

901
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:37,031
- Ilwolseong? - Yes.

902
01:01:37,032 --> 01:01:39,892
He's the worst of them all, and very dangerous too.

903
01:01:40,092 --> 01:01:44,133
Anyone who knows his identity ends up getting killed off.

904
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,571
I think I heard of him,

905
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:51,112
but isn't he knowledgeable and virtuous...

906
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:52,173
What?

907
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,141
That sounds as preposterous...

908
01:01:54,142 --> 01:01:56,241
as a date getting struck by lightning on a clear day.

909
01:01:56,242 --> 01:01:58,613
That's not true at all.

910
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:03,822
Are you...

911
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:06,193
Ilwolseong...

912
01:02:10,122 --> 01:02:12,432
I mean, you're not his friend, are you?

913
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:15,863
- As if I would be. - Good.

914
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:19,673
Why would you tease me? My heart almost stopped.

915
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:21,872
Here it is.

916
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,241
That's great. Why did you tease me?

917
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,083
My heart almost sank.

918
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:31,281
Why does she remind me of her?

919
01:02:31,282 --> 01:02:32,652
The road's uneven from here.

920
01:02:32,653 --> 01:02:33,722
- Okay. - Okay.

921
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:46,432
Your eyes...

922
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,162
are really beautiful.

923
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:54,003
They're like red jewels.

924
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,512
Are you okay?

925
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,153
Yes, I'm fine.

926
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:11,653
No one has said that to me before.

927
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,023
People see my eyes...

928
01:03:14,563 --> 01:03:16,162
and call me a freak.

929
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:17,392
What?

930
01:03:17,432 --> 01:03:19,793
About such beautiful eyes?

931
01:03:19,932 --> 01:03:22,963
They're the prettiest eyes I've ever seen.

932
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,173
I mean it.

933
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:26,273
- Oh, dear. - Gosh.

934
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:52,662
Are you all right? It's so rocky.

935
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,503
Sir?

936
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,672
What's wrong?

937
01:04:04,673 --> 01:04:06,572
Do you feel unwell?

938
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,852
I need you to get out.

939
01:04:19,853 --> 01:04:20,892
Pardon?

940
01:04:21,293 --> 01:04:22,523
Just like that?

941
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,031
Man Soo, stop the litter.

942
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,162
Pardon?

943
01:04:26,592 --> 01:04:28,931
Yes, sir. Put down the litter.

944
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:30,003
Sir.

945
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:44,613
Sir, can you tell me your name?

946
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:50,052
- Let's go now, Man Soo. - Yes, Sir Scholar.

947
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:52,853
"Scholar"?

948
01:04:53,992 --> 01:04:55,322
Get back safely.

949
01:04:57,733 --> 01:04:58,733
Let's go.

950
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,532
One, two, three.

951
01:05:01,432 --> 01:05:04,072
Wait, sir! Can I know your name?

952
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:06,133
Sir...

953
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:19,412
She'll be okay on her own at night, won't she?

954
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:22,222
The Capital's very close, but still.

955
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,122
What?

956
01:05:32,592 --> 01:05:35,932
How could he tell me to get out just like that?

957
01:05:41,443 --> 01:05:43,842
I wonder what happened to Nuisance and Frown.

958
01:05:54,322 --> 01:05:55,781
Why is he moving so much?

959
01:05:55,782 --> 01:05:58,952
Will you hold on tight? The road's rough as it is.

960
01:05:58,992 --> 01:06:00,523
The litter's shaking.

961
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:06,333
This is a bit serious.

962
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:07,903
Stand still.

963
01:06:10,702 --> 01:06:12,772
Put down the litter.

964
01:06:12,773 --> 01:06:14,072
Do it, now!

965
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:49,773
Sir, you're okay, aren't you?

966
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:14,233
Sir.

967
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:54,173
What is that?

968
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:00,241
It's a ghost.

969
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,943
No, it's a freak! The freak!

970
01:08:07,182 --> 01:08:08,323
Sir.

971
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:11,953
He's gone?

972
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:30,842
Run!

973
01:08:31,613 --> 01:08:33,613
Go. Get out of here!

974
01:08:40,853 --> 01:08:42,582
You made a mistake, Ha Ram.

975
01:08:43,283 --> 01:08:45,792
On the Winter Solstice when Yin prevails,

976
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:48,063
you crossed the boundary.

977
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:11,712
I found my eyes.

978
01:09:19,295 --> 01:09:21,225
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

979
01:09:21,265 --> 01:09:23,833
Something happened on Mount Inwang.

980
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:26,233
He fell from the sky...

981
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:27,703
and passed out.

982
01:09:27,704 --> 01:09:29,604
What do you mean the soldiers died overnight?

983
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:31,804
The bodies are all listless.

984
01:09:31,805 --> 01:09:33,134
It's very strange.

985
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,873
It's a mark of the Demon.

986
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:36,943
Is this truly a copy?

987
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:39,273
Find the cheeky copycat painter for me.

988
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:41,885
- Lock her up this instant! - No!

989
01:09:42,414 --> 01:09:44,554
What's the delay when it's Hong Cheon Gi?

990
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,854
Her mad father is always outside.

991
01:09:46,855 --> 01:09:48,323
Get her right now!

992
01:09:48,324 --> 01:09:51,453
Memories of the girl from the peach orchard...

993
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:52,993
keep overlapping with her.

994
01:09:52,994 --> 01:09:54,124
Who are you?
