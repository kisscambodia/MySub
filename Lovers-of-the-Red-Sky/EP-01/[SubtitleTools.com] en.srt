00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,291
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,879
(This drama is fictional and people or stories are not tied to reality.)

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,480
Long, long ago,

4
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:16,149
there was a time when humans lived in harmony...

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,990
with nature alongside beings that were not visible to the human eye.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,529
One such being was three deities dwelling in one body.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,770
They were called Samsin.

8
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,069
The eldest presided over birth.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,280
The second presided over death.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,809
The third presided over the balance between the two.

11
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,789
One day, the deity of death that craved more blood...

12
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,490
ate up the deity that managed balance.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,660
The balance of life and death fell,

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,830
and the world was overcome with fear and unrest.

15
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,069
Around this time, the Demon broke off from Samsin's body...

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,300
and lived off the evil greed of the humans.

17
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,809
A woman who had lost her lover...

18
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:12,380
because of the Demon's reckless madness...

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,410
completed a drawing.

20
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:19,050
Old lady Samsin responded to her plea...

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,119
and took possession of the painting,

22
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,350
and the Devil who had brought havoc on the world...

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,059
became sealed within that very painting.

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,199
And then that woman disappeared.

25
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,169
(Episode 1: The Red Sky)

26
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,750
(Dan Dynasty, First year of King Seongjo)

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,530
(King Yeongjong ruled the world through the Demon in his body,)

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,560
(but he was afraid of the bloodbath caused by the untrollable Demon...)

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,569
(that he passed down his throne to his son, Seongjo,)

30
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,569
(and decides to do a ritual of sealing his own portrait...)

31
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,569
(in order to get rid of the Demon.)

32
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,819
Eun O, have you heard?

33
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:06,652
That this portrait is meant to be used to contain something?

34
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:10,931
They extracted something devastating from the king's body,

35
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,471
and are going to seal it in here.

36
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,741
I pray to you, oh deities.

37
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:17,341
May my husband's painting...

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,570
be completed without any problems.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,381
I pray to you, oh deities.

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,931
This will do. Step aside.

41
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,431
But as a Seongjucheong shaman...

42
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:47,131
The Sealing Ceremony is held by Jokyeokjeon.

43
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,040
I understand.

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,669
(Hong Eun O, Gohwawon painter)

45
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:25,140
How can a painting be this powerful?

46
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,441
It is truly amazing.

47
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,580
Now it is all...

48
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,251
up to the will of the heavens.

49
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,890
Baby.

50
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:45,530
My baby.

51
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:47,260
Darling.

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,200
Dear Buddha.

53
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,671
Dear deities.

54
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,210
Dear Samsin. If anyone can hear me,

55
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,840
please protect my baby.

56
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,881
Samsin.

57
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,520
Please protect my baby.

58
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,561
Please protect...

59
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,150
Cheon Gi.

60
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:04,199
(Old lady Samsin: Gave life since the beginning of time)

61
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:30,395
Dear Cheon Gi, you were afraid, were you?

62
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,195
What is wrong? What is the matter?

63
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,106
Sir.

64
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:22,986
Father.

65
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:26,716
Is it truly possible to seal the Demon...

66
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,556
in a portrait of you?

67
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:33,556
That is the only way to banish the Demon from this world.

68
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:37,125
Too much blood was shed in the long war against the Demon,

69
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,895
and I will end it today.

70
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:43,505
Begin.

71
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:55,385
Om mani padme hum.

72
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:59,955
Om mani padme hum.

73
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,525
Om mani padme hum.

74
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:54,884
(The Demon: Caused death since the beginning of time)

75
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:58,594
Who dare awaken me?

76
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,325
Did you dare wake me up?

77
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,224
You fool!

78
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:05,695
He is our King!

79
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:08,705
The Demon must show his respect!

80
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,305
Do not look into his eyes. Do not make eye contact!

81
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:30,524
King. Step closer to me.

82
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,695
Take me in.

83
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:39,094
You can never escape me.

84
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:00,854
Hello?

85
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,524
Is anyone there?

86
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,825
(Hwacha: A goblin that lives on the energy of paintings)

87
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:52,035
Samsin.

88
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:07,114
Samsin, how dare you?

89
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:48,524
From now on, you shall all suffer from droughts and famine.

90
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:56,504
Your offspring shall endlessly wander in the darkness.

91
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:06,215
Your offspring shall never be able to paint again.

92
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:57,393
To think that he made you blind.

93
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:04,034
Then again, the Demon has always been mean.

94
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:06,804
Baby,

95
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,373
I cannot lift your curse,

96
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:16,613
but I will match you with someone who will protect you from the curse.

97
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:31,093
My Lady, you gave birth to a boy.

98
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:34,733
Baby, your name is Ram.

99
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:38,003
You are the eldest son of the noble Ha family,

100
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,734
Ha Ram.

101
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,643
That is a beautiful name.

102
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,493
Is something wrong?

103
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:11,473
Will this really bring peace to the world?

104
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:15,003
I am afraid the Demon will break free.

105
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,743
You do not have to worry.

106
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:19,873
Your kingdom will enjoy an age of peace.

107
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:21,843
The curse bothers me.

108
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:25,414
I mean the one about droughts and famine.

109
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,994
Giddy up.

110
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,074
What do you think you're doing?

111
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,373
Do you think you can get away with this?

112
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:48,503
Once the former king finds out...

113
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,904
The former king chose Seongjucheong.

114
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:53,714
You may step down now.

115
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,044
Slay!

116
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,414
Scatter!

117
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:05,723
To boil the hound once it has caught the rabbit.

118
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:23,374
I did what I did...

119
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,045
for the safety...

120
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,613
of the royal family and the people.

121
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:51,134
(9 years later, the 9th year of Seongjo's reign)

122
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,405
(The ritual was a success, but due to the curse of the Demon,)

123
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:54,873
(Dan Dynasty suffered 9 years of famine and drought.)

124
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,304
(the head priestess, Mi Su, looks for a helper...)

125
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:57,743
(to sacrifice for the rainmaking ritual.)

126
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:01,074
What does it say?

127
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,814
I can't read either. I have no idea.

128
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,353
- The king lacks virtue? - The drought is getting worse.

129
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:07,883
- I'm sure His Majesty has a plan. - Don't be ridiculous.

130
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,654
That's why it doesn't rain!

131
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:11,454
The drought has been going on for years!

132
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,924
- Coming through! - Father!

133
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:16,294
- Father! - Honey!

134
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,763
Not a single grain can leave the house.

135
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:21,904
Do you understand?

136
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,233
- Yes, Master. - Yes, Master.

137
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:29,374
- Oh, no. - Please.

138
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:30,905
- There's no water left. - Give us rain.

139
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:36,744
That boy has a marvelous ability.

140
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:38,655
- It's here. - Are you sure there's water here?

141
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:40,914
- Let's dig! - Dig!

142
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,954
The boy says there's water here. Hurry up and dig.

143
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,464
- Water... It's water! - It's water!

144
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:54,364
That boy must possess...

145
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:57,333
the energy of water.

146
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,104
We found water!

147
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,273
Father!

148
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:10,344
Hi, Ram.

149
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:12,914
Did it go well?

150
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:14,614
- Isn't that man... - Yes, Father.

151
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:15,783
Master Ha Sung Jin?

152
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,783
Let's go inside. Come.

153
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,523
So he was alive.

154
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,894
It's been a long time, Master Ha.

155
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,664
How dare you show up here?

156
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,704
Even after all these years,

157
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:36,503
I'm sure your resentment is beyond words.

158
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,743
You haven't the slightest idea.

159
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:40,844
I was under the orders of the former king.

160
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:43,714
Tell me why you're here right now,

161
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,884
or I'll kill you with my own hands.

162
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:47,854
I'm here for your son.

163
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:54,293
You little...

164
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:57,723
I'm sure you're aware that he was born with the energy of water.

165
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,364
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

166
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:01,394
Master Ha.

167
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,604
This kingdom has been suffering from droughts for nine years now.

168
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,434
We need him at the next dragon rainmaking ritual.

169
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:11,644
Shut your mouth! I don't want to hear any more. Leave right now!

170
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:32,894
Your powers have become stronger.

171
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:35,634
I'm the royal shaman now.

172
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,464
(Royal shaman: A shaman who performs royal rituals)

173
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,174
I'm taking your son as a helper for the ritual.

174
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,444
It's not a matter of choice.

175
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:44,844
Get prepared.

176
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,844
We shall leave early in the morning.

177
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:59,594
What's the most important thing when it comes to portraits?

178
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,394
It's not the eyes that you see,

179
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:05,894
but the eyes that see you.

180
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:11,033
Guys, it's the blind ghost and her father.

181
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:15,104
My mom says they're possessed.

182
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:16,844
Possessed? Really?

183
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:19,043
Guys, do you believe that?

184
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,344
That makes no sense!

185
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,483
Watch this.

186
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,313
- Come and take it! - Come and take it!

187
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:27,983
- Give it back! - Come and take it!

188
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:31,283
- Come and take it! - Give it back! It's my father's!

189
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:33,124
- Give it back! - Come and take it!

190
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:36,823
Go away, ghost!

191
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:38,733
You beggar.

192
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,964
You're filthy. Get lost!

193
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:46,434
Leave my daughter, Cheon Gi, alone.

194
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,604
- Leave her alone. - What's wrong?

195
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,773
Father, don't do that.

196
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,073
I'm fine. Father!

197
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:53,414
Father, please.

198
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:54,773
I'm fine.

199
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,414
Father!

200
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:58,313
Hey, let's go!

201
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,354
Let's run. Hurry!

202
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:02,583
Let's run!

203
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,454
Move out of the way!

204
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:07,894
Move out of the way!

205
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:18,134
Don't look him in the eye.

206
00:20:18,704 --> 00:20:21,233
- Never look him in the eye. - Father?

207
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:22,704
Don't look him in the eye.

208
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:26,144
Don't look him in the eye, never.

209
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:29,083
I sense the Demon's energy.

210
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,954
Don't look him in the eye.

211
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:45,793
Stop. Please stop, okay?

212
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,333
What's this energy?

213
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,333
My father isn't in his right mind.

214
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:53,973
Where am I?

215
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:56,303
Father, are you okay?

216
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:02,884
- Cheon Gi. - Father, do you recognize me?

217
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,783
- Cheon Gi. - Father.

218
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,124
My dear Cheon Gi.

219
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:16,293
Eun O. Hong Eun O.

220
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:20,293
Is that really you?

221
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:22,634
Were you...

222
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,503
alive?

223
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,704
Master Ha?

224
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:29,444
I'm delighted to see you again.

225
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:32,674
(Seongjucheong: An institution in charge of royal shamanic rituals)

226
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,674
Are you all right?

227
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,983
You seemed to throw a fit earlier.

228
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:40,053
My fits started after that day.

229
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,783
Now I am getting more forgetful by the day.

230
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:47,594
I am worried sick about my young daughter, Cheon Gi.

231
00:21:49,094 --> 00:21:52,333
She was born in the Shinchuk Year. On that very day.

232
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:59,273
So was my son.

233
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,333
Is he all right?

234
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:07,473
Ram, why don't you go and play in the yard?

235
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:08,614
Yes, Father.

236
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:11,384
Cheon Gi, you should go out too.

237
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:14,813
Then can I stop by at the Baekyu Painters Society?

238
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:16,583
Please, father.

239
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,323
What a smart little girl.

240
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:22,394
- Ram, why don't you accompany her? - Yes, Father.

241
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:33,134
I'm used to going there alone.

242
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:35,033
I'm not following you.

243
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:37,573
Does this area belong to you or what?

244
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,954
(Baekyu Painters Society)

245
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,424
- What's this place? - Goodness!

246
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,864
You really followed me?

247
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:58,323
I walked ahead of you.

248
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,333
Is that a joke?

249
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,533
I said, what's this place?

250
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:06,973
It's the Baekyu Painters Society.

251
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,944
It's a private painting group.

252
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:11,674
A private painting group?

253
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:14,414
It means they sell their paintings.

254
00:23:16,543 --> 00:23:19,884
The painting we're going to copy today is not an old one.

255
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:20,884
(Copying: One of the six ways to learn how to paint)

256
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:28,924
This is a painting I made at Gohwawon...

257
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:34,134
of some men I saw at the market who gambled on a cockfight.

258
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:38,333
- Oh... Chun Bok. - Yes?

259
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:41,973
You'll have to take over.

260
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:44,844
Master Choi.

261
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:48,983
Master Choi, where are you going?

262
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:56,684
All right. There are a few things you can learn from this painting.

263
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,993
By the way, why are we here?

264
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:01,854
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

265
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,464
Just tell me.

266
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:07,134
Stop prying without giving me anything in return.

267
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,164
Do you want me to pay?

268
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:12,333
Nothing in the world is free.

269
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:13,733
Forget it.

270
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:15,773
I don't want to know.

271
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:19,813
Fine.

272
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:23,344
Try closing your eyes.

273
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:24,743
I don't want to.

274
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:31,354
Once you close your eyes,

275
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:33,723
you hear sounds.

276
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:50,844
Do you hear that?

277
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,114
I hear the brush moving on the paper.

278
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:02,013
Swish.

279
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:03,884
Swash.

280
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:07,293
Goodness, now you're bragging.

281
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:11,323
As I listen to the sounds,

282
00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:13,833
images arise in my mind.

283
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:16,303
And when that happens,

284
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:18,533
I feel good.

285
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:23,043
I see the world through sounds.

286
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:35,253
Please.

287
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,323
Ms. Gyeonju.

288
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,094
Master Choi.

289
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:45,563
Ms. Gyeonju.

290
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:46,763
Master Choi.

291
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:49,763
Cheon Gi.

292
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:51,934
I've run out of paints at home.

293
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,303
Can I take some leftover paints home?

294
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,644
Sure, go ahead.

295
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:58,404
Okay. Thank you.

296
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:11,924
Master Choi.

297
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:14,223
What? What is it now?

298
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:18,793
Have you seen Ms. Gyeonju?

299
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:21,364
She said she had something for me,

300
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:23,404
but I can't find her in the kitchen.

301
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,104
There's a bundle in the shed.

302
00:26:26,874 --> 00:26:28,204
A bundle in the shed.

303
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:31,303
He says there's a bundle in the shed.

304
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:33,573
Yes, there's a bundle in the shed.

305
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:36,783
What a smart boy. Will you help her find it?

306
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:38,884
Sure. Let's go, Cheon Gi.

307
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:53,634
Ms. Gyeonju.

308
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,604
Master Choi, the class is...

309
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,973
- I give up! - Oh, my.

310
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,704
- Fine, I give up! - Master Choi!

311
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:07,773
Why are you so thick?

312
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:10,144
I shouldn't have taken you in.

313
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:12,983
By the way,

314
00:27:13,654 --> 00:27:16,854
how did you know there was a bundle in the shed?

315
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:18,823
Well...

316
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:20,594
That's...

317
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:23,424
Cheon Gi, you're here.

318
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:25,194
Ms. Gyeonju.

319
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,164
I thought you were away.

320
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,434
Well, the thing is...

321
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:33,204
Hold on a second.

322
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,904
Your jeogori is torn.

323
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:39,243
Give me a second. I'll go and mend it right away.

324
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:40,543
Wait here.

325
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:46,954
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:50,023
I get holes in my clothes all the time.

327
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:52,083
I thought you were the same.

328
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:55,993
Don't you have a mother either?

329
00:27:56,763 --> 00:27:57,793
I do.

330
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,864
Why? Don't you?

331
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:03,404
She passed away...

332
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,503
on the day I was born.

333
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:21,983
What are you drawing, all of a sudden?

334
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:28,424
A star.

335
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:34,063
That looks more like a full moon to me.

336
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:37,964
To me, this is a star.

337
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,283
What are you doing?

338
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,013
Let's draw together.

339
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:21,674
Is this a star?

340
00:29:21,674 --> 00:29:22,684
Yes.

341
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:24,313
The Big Dipper.

342
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:28,914
The Big Dipper.

343
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:34,493
Are you hungry?

344
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,723
No, I'm not.

345
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:41,993
Follow me.

346
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:55,674
You two.

347
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:58,914
Come over here.

348
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:00,354
Us?

349
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:03,553
Yes. You two. Come here.

350
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,624
Let me see you.

351
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,194
Here. Tomorrow,

352
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:15,263
you will need this.

353
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:19,704
No, it is okay. I cannot accept something like this.

354
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,073
What do you mean?

355
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:24,674
Oh?

356
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:28,243
What's wrong?

357
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,114
What is it?

358
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:31,583
Nothing.

359
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,813
I think I was mistaken.

360
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:41,053
Let's go.

361
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,563
Keep your hands held tight.

362
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,263
They finally met.

363
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:52,134
(Seongjucheong)

364
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:55,674
What brought you to Guanyang?

365
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:58,144
Fate can be so cruel.

366
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,374
At the next rainmaking ritual,

367
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:03,283
my son was selected to be the helper.

368
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,983
My son Ha Ram was born with the energy of water.

369
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:10,924
Then he is going to the Palace?

370
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:13,094
He must not.

371
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:18,964
What?

372
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:21,964
You found a helper for the dragon rainmaking ritual?

373
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,204
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:25,833
We are keeping him in Seongjucheong.

375
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,973
Who is he?

376
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:30,473
He's the son of Ha Sung Jin who was Lord of Jokyeokjeon,

377
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:33,543
and he is a special child with the energy of the water deity.

378
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:36,083
The man who sealed the Demon nine years ago?

379
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,583
He is still alive?

380
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,743
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:42,414
He seems to have cheated death and moved to Yangzhou.

382
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,293
What a relief.

383
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:50,964
However,

384
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:54,894
this time, I must sacrifice his son?

385
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,604
You must withstand the pain and make the decision

386
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:00,573
for your starving people.

387
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:04,444
Are you saying we must sacrifice a human being?

388
00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:08,743
Your Majesty.

389
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:11,013
One century ago, a life was taken at a rainmaking ritual,

390
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,813
and the deities swallowed their fury to give us rain.

391
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:17,184
How dare you say such things?

392
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,323
We follow Confucius' and Mencius' teachings,

393
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:21,454
and we cannot do such terrible things.

394
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:25,664
My lords. Have you already forgotten what happened nine years ago?

395
00:32:25,664 --> 00:32:27,993
Droughts and famine have plagued us for years.

396
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:32,233
Sacrificing a life is the only way to lift the Demon's curse.

397
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:36,303
How dare a mere shaman speak her mind in this great hall?

398
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,404
What do you think?

399
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:41,844
The heavens' will not change whatever we humans do.

400
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:45,583
It is unthinkable that they would even accept a human sacrifice.

401
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,414
I agree with you.

402
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:52,253
The dragon rainmaking ritual will be held with dignity,

403
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:55,454
but without a human sacrifice. Do you understand?

404
00:32:55,624 --> 00:32:58,164
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:02,233
There will be no rain without a human sacrifice, Your Majesty.

406
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:06,204
Even if you all disapprove, I must go through with it.

407
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:08,634
As the royal shaman.

408
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,023
Hey.

409
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:30,694
What are you doing? This is what thieves do.

410
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:32,634
Quiet.

411
00:33:53,953 --> 00:33:55,154
Hey.

412
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:57,083
There's someone here.

413
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,253
Don't you hear her snore?

414
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:02,994
Not bad.

415
00:34:03,393 --> 00:34:04,994
Do you see the stick over there?

416
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:06,293
Yes.

417
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:08,333
Climb the tree.

418
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:13,833
Can't you just tell your father you're hungry?

419
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,304
There's a famine. Do you want to cause them trouble?

420
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:19,714
Okay, fine.

421
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,733
Be quiet.

422
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:47,534
Everyone here knows peach orchard's Ms. Anseong.

423
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:49,703
Why?

424
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:54,143
She has a fiery temper that makes grown men tremble in their shoes.

425
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:56,143
That means she's dangerous.

426
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:59,913
If she catches you, you'll never walk again.

427
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,183
What?

428
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:04,353
I won't do this, then. I'm coming down.

429
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:09,154
I want a peach.

430
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:13,594
I can't pick any because I can't see.

431
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:17,733
Okay.

432
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:07,813
Are you okay?

433
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:12,083
Who's there?

434
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:14,194
Oh?

435
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:17,063
Who's there?

436
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:18,764
Hey, run.

437
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:19,964
Okay.

438
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:33,474
She's coming. Run faster.

439
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:41,884
Are you okay? Let's go.

440
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:44,753
You fools. Don't you dare come back!

441
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,634
It's all your fault. If not for you,

442
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,703
we wouldn't have had to run from someone that scary.

443
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:04,844
Where are you going?

444
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:07,714
I hate you.

445
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:14,253
I never said wanted to steal someone else's peaches.

446
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:15,683
You're just the same.

447
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:18,384
Because I can't see,

448
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,753
because my dad's not right in his head,

449
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:26,764
because my mom died while giving birth to me,

450
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,333
I have no friends.

451
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:32,733
Everyone ridicules me for no reason.

452
00:37:33,904 --> 00:37:35,534
They say I'm cursed.

453
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:40,614
I just wanted to share some peaches.

454
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:47,284
I'm sorry.

455
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:51,154
Whatever.

456
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:56,924
But...

457
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,563
your mom dying after you were born,

458
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:03,804
you not being able to see,

459
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:09,034
and your dad not being right in his head...

460
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:10,873
isn't your fault.

461
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:12,404
So why...

462
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:14,674
Why? What?

463
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:16,683
You don't know anything.

464
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:19,853
You're right.

465
00:38:20,554 --> 00:38:22,083
I don't know anything,

466
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,384
but it couldn't be helped.

467
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:30,063
All that happened to you were out of everyone's control.

468
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:32,424
It wasn't your fault.

469
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:38,864
So don't blame yourself over...

470
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,534
what wasn't your fault.

471
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:54,054
I ran so much that I'm even more hungry now.

472
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:57,983
This is definitely your fault.

473
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:04,724
Here.

474
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:14,333
Darn it. It's not yet ripe.

475
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:17,304
It's sweet. It tastes just fine.

476
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:20,413
Oh?

477
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:28,853
What are you doing?

478
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:49,233
It'll be okay now.

479
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,714
Where is your bundle?

480
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,884
Oh, no. The bundle Ms. Gyeonju gave me.

481
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,623
I must've lost it while we were running away.

482
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:07,853
Here it is.

483
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:09,293
You really have it?

484
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:12,494
That's great.

485
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,433
Why did you tease me?

486
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:16,703
My heart almost sank.

487
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,703
You are merciless.

488
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:21,833
I can't even tease you.

489
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:28,014
There are so many stars tonight.

490
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:31,944
There's the Big Dipper.

491
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:33,853
Really?

492
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:45,563
Oh, right.

493
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:46,733
Oh, right, what?

494
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:49,694
Do you feel bad I can't see the stars?

495
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:51,534
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:54,103
I was inconsiderate.

497
00:40:57,674 --> 00:40:59,174
How many stars are there?

498
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:03,813
About one hundred million?

499
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:07,154
How many is one hundred million?

500
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:11,623
Lots and lots.

501
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:22,864
Get down now. We're back.

502
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,174
Wait.

503
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,174
Here. You need it back.

504
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,444
No.

505
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:40,514
I'll come for it after the rainmaking ritual.

506
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:44,784
Isn't this very precious?

507
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:47,494
This? It's nothing much.

508
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:49,453
it's just...

509
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:53,094
an one-and-only handkerchief my mom gave me.

510
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:56,804
Is that lie true?

511
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:01,703
Okay. Come back tomorrow.

512
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:03,404
I'll wait for you.

513
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:06,043
Okay.

514
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:09,744
Then...

515
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:13,683
I'll get you more peaches while Ms. Anseong's back is turned.

516
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:18,253
Give me your hand.

517
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:20,453
My hand?

518
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:20,353
Here. Take this.

519
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:24,654
Take it.

520
00:43:28,924 --> 00:43:32,563
You'll go to pick peaches with me tomorrow, right?

521
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,364
Of course I will.

522
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:39,563
Good. You promised.

523
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:41,974
Yes.

524
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:45,304
Let's go.

525
00:44:23,543 --> 00:44:27,083
His Majesty the King.

526
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:40,594
You must be Ha Ram.

527
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:47,273
I lack in virtue and must rely on your help.

528
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:52,003
I owe your family a great debt.

529
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:54,744
Thank you.

530
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:03,523
Drawings are all about the eyes.

531
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:05,824
Your soul must be clean!

532
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:07,293
Darn you!

533
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:09,094
My goodness.

534
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:11,324
What is wrong with you?

535
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:29,574
Save me. Don't kill me.

536
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:39,224
Dad. This time,

537
00:45:39,224 --> 00:45:41,293
a really good medicine came in.

538
00:45:41,453 --> 00:45:44,893
Hang in there. Give me a little more time.

539
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:58,074
His Highness the Crown Prince.

540
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:10,284
Lee Hoo. It has been a while.

541
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:11,353
(Lee Kang: King Seongjo's first son)

542
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:13,253
Why haven't you visited in so long?

543
00:46:13,824 --> 00:46:16,764
Your Highness, don't speak to me so politely.

544
00:46:17,393 --> 00:46:18,864
There are people watching.

545
00:46:18,864 --> 00:46:20,023
Who cares about that?

546
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:22,793
We are brothers from the same mother.

547
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,264
I am so pleased to see all my younger brothers.

548
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:28,134
Your Highness.

549
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:31,373
Our nation's in great distress caused by...

550
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,003
the long drought and famine.

551
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,074
Rather than focus on pleasure,

552
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:38,543
please think more of the meaning of the upcoming rainmaking ritual.

553
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,583
Hoo.

554
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:44,523
The day I become king, I will remember your advice.

555
00:46:46,123 --> 00:46:47,924
Thank you, Your Highness.

556
00:46:49,194 --> 00:46:52,224
Do you have to be so stiff?

557
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:55,833
Yul, I did not remind the Crown Prince...

558
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,663
because he doesn't know the meaning.

559
00:46:58,003 --> 00:46:59,264
That's enough, Yul.

560
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:01,833
Hoo spoke out of concern for me.

561
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:04,043
(Lee Yul, Prince Yangmyeong: King Seongjo's third son)

562
00:47:04,043 --> 00:47:05,503
I understand, Your Highness.

563
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:22,224
Hoo.

564
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:25,464
Why do you walk so fast?

565
00:47:26,864 --> 00:47:27,864
Leave me alone.

566
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:30,094
Did what I say upset you?

567
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:32,663
Let it go, Hoo.

568
00:47:32,964 --> 00:47:35,404
Yul, do you not feel anything?

569
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:37,703
About what?

570
00:47:37,703 --> 00:47:39,273
We're like a guelder rose.

571
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:42,744
We can flower but we'll never bear fruit.

572
00:47:43,714 --> 00:47:45,313
A flower with no life.

573
00:47:45,683 --> 00:47:47,813
Each time I meet the Crown Prince,

574
00:47:47,813 --> 00:47:49,413
I get frustrated.

575
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:52,284
Even though it can't be helped.

576
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:56,753
Hoo.

577
00:47:57,123 --> 00:47:59,924
A guelder rose is light green when it first blooms.

578
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:04,804
It's white when in full bloom, then turns yellow before it wilts.

579
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:08,433
How can you say it has no life...

580
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:10,244
when it lives one so colorful?

581
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,574
Come with me, Hoo.

582
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:18,483
I will cheer you up.

583
00:48:19,614 --> 00:48:21,154
What are you talking about?

584
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:23,724
I will show you something fantastic.

585
00:48:31,063 --> 00:48:34,194
(Gyeongwon Pavilion: Late kings' portraits were kept and honored)

586
00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:40,233
Your sacred turtle talisman fell off.

587
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:42,534
(Sacred turtle: Said to live 10,000 years and chase away evil)

588
00:48:44,373 --> 00:48:46,143
Talisman are said to chase evil.

589
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:49,043
Father told us to keep one close at all times.

590
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,683
Put it in a deep pocket.

591
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:53,614
It's a bad omen.

592
00:48:54,054 --> 00:48:55,753
Why did it fall off?

593
00:48:57,253 --> 00:48:58,853
Forget about that, Hoo.

594
00:48:59,224 --> 00:49:02,893
When will we ever get to see this if not now?

595
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:07,793
This place has a really strange energy.

596
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,304
(Tablet of the First King)

597
00:49:28,353 --> 00:49:29,614
(Tablet of King Gwangjo)

598
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:33,284
He who is to be king.

599
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:37,464
He who is to be king of this land.

600
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:45,203
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

601
00:49:50,744 --> 00:49:53,003
Come to me.

602
00:50:16,964 --> 00:50:19,964
All rise for His Majesty.

603
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:44,884
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

604
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:58,203
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

605
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:02,174
Come to me.

606
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:09,143
My brother, what are you doing? You aren't supposed to touch that.

607
00:52:21,353 --> 00:52:23,893
He who is to be king.

608
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,333
Come to me.

609
00:52:31,003 --> 00:52:32,733
Doesn't Grandfather's portrait...

610
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:36,333
look as if he's still alive?

611
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:39,103
He who is to be king.

612
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:43,273
He who is to be king of this land.

613
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:51,183
"Oration."

614
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:56,154
"Oh, the bright and shining spirit."

615
00:52:56,154 --> 00:53:01,733
"This great drought is harsher on our people than ever."

616
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:05,203
"Our people cry out..."

617
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:09,003
"as they are tormented in this neverending dry spell."

618
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,574
"It's all due to my lack of discretion."

619
00:53:14,574 --> 00:53:18,043
"Please take mercy upon this ritual..."

620
00:53:18,183 --> 00:53:23,583
"and allow heavy rain to fall."

621
00:53:26,523 --> 00:53:27,724
Begin.

622
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:52,444
Salamander, oh salamander

623
00:53:52,444 --> 00:53:55,683
Raise the clouds

624
00:53:55,683 --> 00:53:58,924
And spurt out fogs

625
00:53:58,924 --> 00:54:02,123
Salamander, oh salamander

626
00:54:02,123 --> 00:54:05,224
Raise the clouds

627
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:08,634
And spurt out fogs

628
00:54:08,764 --> 00:54:12,534
Come to me.

629
00:54:12,534 --> 00:54:14,674
He who is to be king.

630
00:54:14,674 --> 00:54:16,904
We must go now. Hurry.

631
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:28,884
He who is to be king.

632
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:33,523
I shall be with you.

633
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:53,074
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

634
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:57,614
I shall be with you.

635
00:54:58,614 --> 00:55:01,813
Salamander, oh salamander

636
00:55:01,813 --> 00:55:05,054
Raise the clouds

637
00:55:05,054 --> 00:55:08,324
And spurt out fogs

638
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:11,563
Salamander, oh salamander

639
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:14,563
Raise the clouds

640
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:17,833
And spurt out fogs

641
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:23,873
If you let sweet rain fall

642
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:29,143
I will let you go

643
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:51,333
Is it you...

644
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,563
who woke me up?

645
00:56:47,183 --> 00:56:48,494
Wait, this is...

646
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:55,494
human sacrifice?

647
00:56:59,603 --> 00:57:00,904
Om mani padme hum!

648
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:50,983
Om mani padme hum.

649
00:58:13,844 --> 00:58:15,844
Where are you?

650
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:29,023
Is it that way?

651
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:49,813
Ha Ram.

652
00:59:04,163 --> 00:59:05,364
My goodness, look.

653
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:13,063
- Goodness! - Goodness!

654
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:17,773
Ha Ram.

655
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:20,804
Oh no.

656
00:59:23,174 --> 00:59:24,313
Father.

657
00:59:25,183 --> 00:59:27,514
Father.

658
00:59:30,313 --> 00:59:33,253
Father!

659
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,293
A kid just fell.

660
00:59:35,293 --> 00:59:37,154
- Go get him. - He just fell in the water.

661
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:40,094
Will you go get that kid out?

662
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:42,634
- What are we going to do? - He just fell in.

663
00:59:42,634 --> 00:59:45,534
- Will someone get him? - Ha Ram...

664
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:47,364
Someone save him.

665
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:50,804
Father.

666
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:59,083
Father.

667
01:00:00,784 --> 01:00:02,753
Your Highness!

668
01:00:04,154 --> 01:00:05,483
Escort His Highness out.

669
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:06,523
Your Highness.

670
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:07,994
- Your Highness. - You must leave.

671
01:00:09,123 --> 01:00:10,523
That was my position.

672
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:12,623
Escort the Prince out now.

673
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:15,563
It was truly...

674
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:17,634
my seat!

675
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:24,574
Father.

676
01:00:28,114 --> 01:00:29,974
Father.

677
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:35,983
- This way! - Go!

678
01:00:37,824 --> 01:00:39,483
Escort His Highness this way!

679
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,424
- This way! - Hurry up and evacuate!

680
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:55,233
Father...

681
01:01:05,844 --> 01:01:09,384
Father...

682
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:25,233
Rain! It's raining!

683
01:01:26,534 --> 01:01:28,103
It's raining.

684
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,983
Ha Ram!

685
01:01:43,384 --> 01:01:45,583
Ha Ram!

686
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:48,654
It's raining!

687
01:01:50,424 --> 01:01:51,793
It's really raining!

688
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:57,904
It was mine.

689
01:01:59,904 --> 01:02:02,974
The King's throne was mine.

690
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:57,964
Ha Ram.

691
01:02:59,864 --> 01:03:02,494
You have sacrificed your life...

692
01:03:02,494 --> 01:03:05,304
for the lives of thousands, tens of thousands of people.

693
01:03:06,503 --> 01:03:08,233
Did you use the kid as bait...

694
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:10,233
to lure me in?

695
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:11,844
Demon.

696
01:03:11,974 --> 01:03:15,074
Reside in this child's body.

697
01:03:15,344 --> 01:03:19,514
I'll take away the source of your energy, your eyes.

698
01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:36,893
You won't be able to use your power...

699
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:40,663
until the day you retrieve your eyes.

700
01:03:44,773 --> 01:03:48,844
Cheon Gi.

701
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:54,083
The promised child who will save this world.

702
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:59,784
I will leave these eyes to you for a moment.

703
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:09,264
Make the pottery of fate.

704
01:05:16,194 --> 01:05:19,103
(Gyeonghoeru)

705
01:05:31,214 --> 01:05:33,014
Look at him!

706
01:05:48,494 --> 01:05:49,634
Ram.

707
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:53,364
- My lord. - Move aside!

708
01:05:55,804 --> 01:05:56,974
Ram.

709
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:00,603
Ram.

710
01:06:01,614 --> 01:06:02,674
Ram!

711
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:06,913
Ram!

712
01:06:17,623 --> 01:06:19,424
Arrest the shaman now!

713
01:06:20,023 --> 01:06:22,634
Your Majesty.

714
01:06:22,634 --> 01:06:24,534
I'm falsely blamed, Your Majesty.

715
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:28,003
Please give me a chance to explain, Your Majesty!

716
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:48,494
Ram.

717
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:01,103
- Father. - Ram.

718
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:15,813
I... I can't see anything.

719
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,023
Father.

720
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:34,634
Nothing.

721
01:07:35,304 --> 01:07:39,373
I can't see anything, Father.

722
01:07:40,043 --> 01:07:42,444
In the distant future,

723
01:07:42,543 --> 01:07:45,844
when the two of you are reunited,

724
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:51,583
everything will fall into its place.

725
01:07:56,653 --> 01:08:01,493
(Special thanks to Jeon Kook Hwan, Han Sang Jin and Kim Pub Lae)

726
01:08:08,474 --> 01:08:11,644
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

727
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:02,894
(Every necessary precaution was taken when filming the water scene.)

728
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,349
The only painter in this city.

729
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:06,620
The sole lady of our studio.

730
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,790
There is no use in drawing everything identically.

731
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:11,719
I mean that you must reflect people's hopes in the painting.

732
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:12,889
You're here, Lord Ha.

733
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:15,559
It'll soon be 3am. We'll begin with Vermilion Bird of the South.

734
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:19,399
How are you going to explain this blind man studying astrology?

735
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:22,000
She has no pride as a painter.

736
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,570
What's the charm of imitated work?

737
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,570
