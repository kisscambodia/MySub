00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:02,791
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,379
(This drama is fictional and people or stories are not tied to reality.)

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,980
Long, long ago,

4
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:16,649
there was a time when humans lived in harmony...

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,490
with nature alongside beings that were not visible to the human eye.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,029
One such being was three deities dwelling in one body.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,270
They were called Samsin.

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,569
The eldest presided over birth.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,780
The second presided over death.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,309
The third presided over the balance between the two.

11
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,289
One day, the deity of death that craved more blood...

12
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,990
ate up the deity that managed balance.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,160
The balance of life and death fell,

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,330
and the world was overcome with fear and unrest.

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,569
Around this time, the Demon broke off from Samsin's body...

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,800
and lived off the evil greed of the humans.

17
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,309
A woman who had lost her lover...

18
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,880
because of the Demon's reckless madness...

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,910
completed a drawing.

20
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,550
Old lady Samsin responded to her plea...

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,619
and took possession of the painting,

22
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,850
and the Devil who had brought havoc on the world...

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,559
became sealed within that very painting.

24
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,699
And then that woman disappeared.

25
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:36,669
(Episode 1: The Red Sky)

26
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,250
(Dan Dynasty, First year of King Seongjo)

27
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,030
(King Yeongjong ruled the world through the Demon in his body,)

28
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,060
(but he was afraid of the bloodbath caused by the untrollable Demon...)

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,069
(that he passed down his throne to his son, Seongjo,)

30
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,069
(and decides to do a ritual of sealing his own portrait...)

31
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,069
(in order to get rid of the Demon.)

32
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,319
Eun O, have you heard?

33
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:07,152
That this portrait is meant to be used to contain something?

34
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:11,431
They extracted something devastating from the king's body,

35
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,971
and are going to seal it in here.

36
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,241
I pray to you, oh deities.

37
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,841
May my husband's painting...

38
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,070
be completed without any problems.

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,881
I pray to you, oh deities.

40
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,431
This will do. Step aside.

41
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,931
But as a Seongjucheong shaman...

42
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,631
The Sealing Ceremony is held by Jokyeokjeon.

43
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,540
I understand.

44
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,169
(Hong Eun O, Gohwawon painter)

45
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,640
How can a painting be this powerful?

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,941
It is truly amazing.

47
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,080
Now it is all...

48
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,751
up to the will of the heavens.

49
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,390
Baby.

50
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,030
My baby.

51
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:47,760
Darling.

52
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,700
Dear Buddha.

53
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,171
Dear deities.

54
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,710
Dear Samsin. If anyone can hear me,

55
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,340
please protect my baby.

56
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,381
Samsin.

57
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,020
Please protect my baby.

58
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:17,061
Please protect...

59
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,650
Cheon Gi.

60
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,699
(Old lady Samsin: Gave life since the beginning of time)

61
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:30,895
Dear Cheon Gi, you were afraid, were you?

62
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,695
What is wrong? What is the matter?

63
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:08,606
Sir.

64
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:23,486
Father.

65
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:27,216
Is it truly possible to seal the Demon...

66
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:29,056
in a portrait of you?

67
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:34,056
That is the only way to banish the Demon from this world.

68
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:37,625
Too much blood was shed in the long war against the Demon,

69
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,395
and I will end it today.

70
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,005
Begin.

71
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,885
Om mani padme hum.

72
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,455
Om mani padme hum.

73
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:04,025
Om mani padme hum.

74
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:55,384
(The Demon: Caused death since the beginning of time)

75
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:59,094
Who dare awaken me?

76
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,825
Did you dare wake me up?

77
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,724
You fool!

78
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,195
He is our King!

79
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,205
The Demon must show his respect!

80
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,805
Do not look into his eyes. Do not make eye contact!

81
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:31,024
King. Step closer to me.

82
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,195
Take me in.

83
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:39,594
You can never escape me.

84
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:01,354
Hello?

85
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,024
Is anyone there?

86
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:10,325
(Hwacha: A goblin that lives on the energy of paintings)

87
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,535
Samsin.

88
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:07,614
Samsin, how dare you?

89
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:49,024
From now on, you shall all suffer from droughts and famine.

90
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:57,004
Your offspring shall endlessly wander in the darkness.

91
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:06,715
Your offspring shall never be able to paint again.

92
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,893
To think that he made you blind.

93
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:04,534
Then again, the Demon has always been mean.

94
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:07,304
Baby,

95
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:10,873
I cannot lift your curse,

96
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:17,113
but I will match you with someone who will protect you from the curse.

97
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,593
My Lady, you gave birth to a boy.

98
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:35,233
Baby, your name is Ram.

99
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,503
You are the eldest son of the noble Ha family,

100
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,234
Ha Ram.

101
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,143
That is a beautiful name.

102
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,993
Is something wrong?

103
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:11,973
Will this really bring peace to the world?

104
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,503
I am afraid the Demon will break free.

105
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,243
You do not have to worry.

106
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:20,373
Your kingdom will enjoy an age of peace.

107
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:22,343
The curse bothers me.

108
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,914
I mean the one about droughts and famine.

109
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,494
Giddy up.

110
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:45,574
What do you think you're doing?

111
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:47,873
Do you think you can get away with this?

112
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,003
Once the former king finds out...

113
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,404
The former king chose Seongjucheong.

114
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,214
You may step down now.

115
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:56,544
Slay!

116
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:00,914
Scatter!

117
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,223
To boil the hound once it has caught the rabbit.

118
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:23,874
I did what I did...

119
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:26,545
for the safety...

120
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:29,113
of the royal family and the people.

121
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:51,634
(9 years later, the 9th year of Seongjo's reign)

122
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:53,905
(The ritual was a success, but due to the curse of the Demon,)

123
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,373
(Dan Dynasty suffered 9 years of famine and drought.)

124
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,804
(the head priestess, Mi Su, looks for a helper...)

125
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:58,243
(to sacrifice for the rainmaking ritual.)

126
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:01,574
What does it say?

127
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:04,314
I can't read either. I have no idea.

128
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:05,853
- The king lacks virtue? - The drought is getting worse.

129
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,383
- I'm sure His Majesty has a plan. - Don't be ridiculous.

130
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,154
That's why it doesn't rain!

131
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,954
The drought has been going on for years!

132
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,424
- Coming through! - Father!

133
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,794
- Father! - Honey!

134
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:21,263
Not a single grain can leave the house.

135
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,404
Do you understand?

136
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,733
- Yes, Master. - Yes, Master.

137
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,874
- Oh, no. - Please.

138
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:31,405
- There's no water left. - Give us rain.

139
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:37,244
That boy has a marvelous ability.

140
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:39,155
- It's here. - Are you sure there's water here?

141
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,414
- Let's dig! - Dig!

142
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,454
The boy says there's water here. Hurry up and dig.

143
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,964
- Water... It's water! - It's water!

144
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,864
That boy must possess...

145
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,833
the energy of water.

146
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:59,604
We found water!

147
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,773
Father!

148
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,844
Hi, Ram.

149
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:13,414
Did it go well?

150
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,114
- Isn't that man... - Yes, Father.

151
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:16,283
Master Ha Sung Jin?

152
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:18,283
Let's go inside. Come.

153
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,023
So he was alive.

154
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,394
It's been a long time, Master Ha.

155
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:31,164
How dare you show up here?

156
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,204
Even after all these years,

157
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:37,003
I'm sure your resentment is beyond words.

158
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,243
You haven't the slightest idea.

159
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:41,344
I was under the orders of the former king.

160
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:44,214
Tell me why you're here right now,

161
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,384
or I'll kill you with my own hands.

162
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,354
I'm here for your son.

163
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:54,793
You little...

164
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:58,223
I'm sure you're aware that he was born with the energy of water.

165
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:00,864
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

166
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:01,894
Master Ha.

167
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,104
This kingdom has been suffering from droughts for nine years now.

168
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:07,934
We need him at the next dragon rainmaking ritual.

169
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:12,144
Shut your mouth! I don't want to hear any more. Leave right now!

170
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,394
Your powers have become stronger.

171
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:36,134
I'm the royal shaman now.

172
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:37,964
(Royal shaman: A shaman who performs royal rituals)

173
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:40,674
I'm taking your son as a helper for the ritual.

174
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,944
It's not a matter of choice.

175
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,344
Get prepared.

176
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,344
We shall leave early in the morning.

177
00:18:55,483 --> 00:19:00,094
What's the most important thing when it comes to portraits?

178
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,894
It's not the eyes that you see,

179
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:06,394
but the eyes that see you.

180
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:11,533
Guys, it's the blind ghost and her father.

181
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:15,604
My mom says they're possessed.

182
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,344
Possessed? Really?

183
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,543
Guys, do you believe that?

184
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,844
That makes no sense!

185
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:22,983
Watch this.

186
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:26,813
- Come and take it! - Come and take it!

187
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,483
- Give it back! - Come and take it!

188
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:31,783
- Come and take it! - Give it back! It's my father's!

189
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,624
- Give it back! - Come and take it!

190
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,323
Go away, ghost!

191
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:39,233
You beggar.

192
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,464
You're filthy. Get lost!

193
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,934
Leave my daughter, Cheon Gi, alone.

194
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,104
- Leave her alone. - What's wrong?

195
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,273
Father, don't do that.

196
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,573
I'm fine. Father!

197
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:53,914
Father, please.

198
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,273
I'm fine.

199
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:56,914
Father!

200
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,813
Hey, let's go!

201
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:01,854
Let's run. Hurry!

202
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,083
Let's run!

203
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,954
Move out of the way!

204
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:08,394
Move out of the way!

205
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:18,634
Don't look him in the eye.

206
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,733
- Never look him in the eye. - Father?

207
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,204
Don't look him in the eye.

208
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:26,644
Don't look him in the eye, never.

209
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:29,583
I sense the Demon's energy.

210
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,454
Don't look him in the eye.

211
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:46,293
Stop. Please stop, okay?

212
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:47,833
What's this energy?

213
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,833
My father isn't in his right mind.

214
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,473
Where am I?

215
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:56,803
Father, are you okay?

216
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:03,384
- Cheon Gi. - Father, do you recognize me?

217
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,283
- Cheon Gi. - Father.

218
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:10,624
My dear Cheon Gi.

219
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:16,793
Eun O. Hong Eun O.

220
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:20,793
Is that really you?

221
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,134
Were you...

222
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,003
alive?

223
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,204
Master Ha?

224
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:29,944
I'm delighted to see you again.

225
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:33,174
(Seongjucheong: An institution in charge of royal shamanic rituals)

226
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:35,174
Are you all right?

227
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:38,483
You seemed to throw a fit earlier.

228
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,553
My fits started after that day.

229
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:43,283
Now I am getting more forgetful by the day.

230
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:48,094
I am worried sick about my young daughter, Cheon Gi.

231
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:52,833
She was born in the Shinchuk Year. On that very day.

232
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:59,773
So was my son.

233
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:01,833
Is he all right?

234
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:07,973
Ram, why don't you go and play in the yard?

235
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,114
Yes, Father.

236
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:11,884
Cheon Gi, you should go out too.

237
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:15,313
Then can I stop by at the Baekyu Painters Society?

238
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,083
Please, father.

239
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,823
What a smart little girl.

240
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:22,894
- Ram, why don't you accompany her? - Yes, Father.

241
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,634
I'm used to going there alone.

242
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,533
I'm not following you.

243
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:38,073
Does this area belong to you or what?

244
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,454
(Baekyu Painters Society)

245
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,924
- What's this place? - Goodness!

246
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,364
You really followed me?

247
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:58,823
I walked ahead of you.

248
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:01,833
Is that a joke?

249
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:05,033
I said, what's this place?

250
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,473
It's the Baekyu Painters Society.

251
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,444
It's a private painting group.

252
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:12,174
A private painting group?

253
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:14,914
It means they sell their paintings.

254
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:20,384
The painting we're going to copy today is not an old one.

255
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:21,384
(Copying: One of the six ways to learn how to paint)

256
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:29,424
This is a painting I made at Gohwawon...

257
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:34,634
of some men I saw at the market who gambled on a cockfight.

258
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,833
- Oh... Chun Bok. - Yes?

259
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:42,473
You'll have to take over.

260
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,344
Master Choi.

261
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,483
Master Choi, where are you going?

262
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:57,184
All right. There are a few things you can learn from this painting.

263
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,493
By the way, why are we here?

264
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,354
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

265
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:04,964
Just tell me.

266
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:07,634
Stop prying without giving me anything in return.

267
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,664
Do you want me to pay?

268
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:12,833
Nothing in the world is free.

269
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:14,233
Forget it.

270
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:16,273
I don't want to know.

271
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:20,313
Fine.

272
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:23,844
Try closing your eyes.

273
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,243
I don't want to.

274
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:31,854
Once you close your eyes,

275
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:34,223
you hear sounds.

276
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:51,344
Do you hear that?

277
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:59,614
I hear the brush moving on the paper.

278
00:25:01,214 --> 00:25:02,513
Swish.

279
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:04,384
Swash.

280
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:07,793
Goodness, now you're bragging.

281
00:25:09,793 --> 00:25:11,823
As I listen to the sounds,

282
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:14,333
images arise in my mind.

283
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:16,803
And when that happens,

284
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,033
I feel good.

285
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,543
I see the world through sounds.

286
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:35,753
Please.

287
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:37,823
Ms. Gyeonju.

288
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:43,594
Master Choi.

289
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:46,063
Ms. Gyeonju.

290
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:47,263
Master Choi.

291
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:50,263
Cheon Gi.

292
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,434
I've run out of paints at home.

293
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,803
Can I take some leftover paints home?

294
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,144
Sure, go ahead.

295
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:58,904
Okay. Thank you.

296
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:12,424
Master Choi.

297
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:14,723
What? What is it now?

298
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:19,293
Have you seen Ms. Gyeonju?

299
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:21,864
She said she had something for me,

300
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:23,904
but I can't find her in the kitchen.

301
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,604
There's a bundle in the shed.

302
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:28,704
A bundle in the shed.

303
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:31,803
He says there's a bundle in the shed.

304
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:34,073
Yes, there's a bundle in the shed.

305
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:37,283
What a smart boy. Will you help her find it?

306
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:39,384
Sure. Let's go, Cheon Gi.

307
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:54,134
Ms. Gyeonju.

308
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,104
Master Choi, the class is...

309
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,473
- I give up! - Oh, my.

310
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:05,204
- Fine, I give up! - Master Choi!

311
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:08,273
Why are you so thick?

312
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,644
I shouldn't have taken you in.

313
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,483
By the way,

314
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:17,354
how did you know there was a bundle in the shed?

315
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,323
Well...

316
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:21,094
That's...

317
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:23,924
Cheon Gi, you're here.

318
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:25,694
Ms. Gyeonju.

319
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:28,664
I thought you were away.

320
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:30,934
Well, the thing is...

321
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:33,704
Hold on a second.

322
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,404
Your jeogori is torn.

323
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:39,743
Give me a second. I'll go and mend it right away.

324
00:27:39,874 --> 00:27:41,043
Wait here.

325
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:47,454
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,523
I get holes in my clothes all the time.

327
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:52,583
I thought you were the same.

328
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:56,493
Don't you have a mother either?

329
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:58,293
I do.

330
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:01,364
Why? Don't you?

331
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:03,904
She passed away...

332
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,003
on the day I was born.

333
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,483
What are you drawing, all of a sudden?

334
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:28,924
A star.

335
00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:34,563
That looks more like a full moon to me.

336
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:38,464
To me, this is a star.

337
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:53,783
What are you doing?

338
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,513
Let's draw together.

339
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:22,174
Is this a star?

340
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,184
Yes.

341
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:24,813
The Big Dipper.

342
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,414
The Big Dipper.

343
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:34,993
Are you hungry?

344
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,223
No, I'm not.

345
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:42,493
Follow me.

346
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:56,174
You two.

347
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:59,414
Come over here.

348
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:00,854
Us?

349
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:04,053
Yes. You two. Come here.

350
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,124
Let me see you.

351
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,694
Here. Tomorrow,

352
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:15,763
you will need this.

353
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:20,204
No, it is okay. I cannot accept something like this.

354
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:21,573
What do you mean?

355
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:25,174
Oh?

356
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:28,743
What's wrong?

357
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,614
What is it?

358
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,083
Nothing.

359
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:35,313
I think I was mistaken.

360
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:41,553
Let's go.

361
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:47,063
Keep your hands held tight.

362
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,763
They finally met.

363
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:52,634
(Seongjucheong)

364
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:56,174
What brought you to Guanyang?

365
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:58,644
Fate can be so cruel.

366
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:00,874
At the next rainmaking ritual,

367
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:03,783
my son was selected to be the helper.

368
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,483
My son Ha Ram was born with the energy of water.

369
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,424
Then he is going to the Palace?

370
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:13,594
He must not.

371
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:19,464
What?

372
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:22,464
You found a helper for the dragon rainmaking ritual?

373
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,704
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:26,333
We are keeping him in Seongjucheong.

375
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,473
Who is he?

376
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:30,973
He's the son of Ha Sung Jin who was Lord of Jokyeokjeon,

377
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:34,043
and he is a special child with the energy of the water deity.

378
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:36,583
The man who sealed the Demon nine years ago?

379
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,083
He is still alive?

380
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,243
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:42,914
He seems to have cheated death and moved to Yangzhou.

382
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,793
What a relief.

383
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:51,464
However,

384
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:55,394
this time, I must sacrifice his son?

385
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:59,104
You must withstand the pain and make the decision

386
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:01,073
for your starving people.

387
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,944
Are you saying we must sacrifice a human being?

388
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:09,243
Your Majesty.

389
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:11,513
One century ago, a life was taken at a rainmaking ritual,

390
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,313
and the deities swallowed their fury to give us rain.

391
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:17,684
How dare you say such things?

392
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:19,823
We follow Confucius' and Mencius' teachings,

393
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:21,954
and we cannot do such terrible things.

394
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:26,164
My lords. Have you already forgotten what happened nine years ago?

395
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:28,493
Droughts and famine have plagued us for years.

396
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:32,733
Sacrificing a life is the only way to lift the Demon's curse.

397
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:36,803
How dare a mere shaman speak her mind in this great hall?

398
00:32:37,174 --> 00:32:38,904
What do you think?

399
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:42,344
The heavens' will not change whatever we humans do.

400
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:46,083
It is unthinkable that they would even accept a human sacrifice.

401
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,914
I agree with you.

402
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,753
The dragon rainmaking ritual will be held with dignity,

403
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:55,954
but without a human sacrifice. Do you understand?

404
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:58,664
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,733
There will be no rain without a human sacrifice, Your Majesty.

406
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:06,704
Even if you all disapprove, I must go through with it.

407
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:09,134
As the royal shaman.

408
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:27,523
Hey.

409
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:31,194
What are you doing? This is what thieves do.

410
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,134
Quiet.

411
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:55,654
Hey.

412
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:57,583
There's someone here.

413
00:33:58,054 --> 00:33:59,753
Don't you hear her snore?

414
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:03,494
Not bad.

415
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:05,494
Do you see the stick over there?

416
00:34:05,764 --> 00:34:06,793
Yes.

417
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:08,833
Climb the tree.

418
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:14,333
Can't you just tell your father you're hungry?

419
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,804
There's a famine. Do you want to cause them trouble?

420
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:20,214
Okay, fine.

421
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,233
Be quiet.

422
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:48,034
Everyone here knows peach orchard's Ms. Anseong.

423
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,203
Why?

424
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:54,643
She has a fiery temper that makes grown men tremble in their shoes.

425
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:56,643
That means she's dangerous.

426
00:34:56,643 --> 00:35:00,413
If she catches you, you'll never walk again.

427
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:01,683
What?

428
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,853
I won't do this, then. I'm coming down.

429
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:09,654
I want a peach.

430
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:14,094
I can't pick any because I can't see.

431
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,233
Okay.

432
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:08,313
Are you okay?

433
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:12,583
Who's there?

434
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:14,694
Oh?

435
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:17,563
Who's there?

436
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:19,264
Hey, run.

437
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,464
Okay.

438
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,974
She's coming. Run faster.

439
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:42,384
Are you okay? Let's go.

440
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:45,253
You fools. Don't you dare come back!

441
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,134
It's all your fault. If not for you,

442
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,203
we wouldn't have had to run from someone that scary.

443
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:05,344
Where are you going?

444
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:08,214
I hate you.

445
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:14,753
I never said wanted to steal someone else's peaches.

446
00:37:14,753 --> 00:37:16,183
You're just the same.

447
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,884
Because I can't see,

448
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:22,253
because my dad's not right in his head,

449
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:27,264
because my mom died while giving birth to me,

450
00:37:27,964 --> 00:37:29,833
I have no friends.

451
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:33,233
Everyone ridicules me for no reason.

452
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:36,034
They say I'm cursed.

453
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:41,114
I just wanted to share some peaches.

454
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:47,784
I'm sorry.

455
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,654
Whatever.

456
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:57,424
But...

457
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,063
your mom dying after you were born,

458
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:04,304
you not being able to see,

459
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:09,534
and your dad not being right in his head...

460
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:11,373
isn't your fault.

461
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:12,904
So why...

462
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:15,174
Why? What?

463
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:17,183
You don't know anything.

464
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:20,353
You're right.

465
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:22,583
I don't know anything,

466
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:24,884
but it couldn't be helped.

467
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:30,563
All that happened to you were out of everyone's control.

468
00:38:31,163 --> 00:38:32,924
It wasn't your fault.

469
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:39,364
So don't blame yourself over...

470
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,034
what wasn't your fault.

471
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,554
I ran so much that I'm even more hungry now.

472
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:58,483
This is definitely your fault.

473
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:05,224
Here.

474
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,833
Darn it. It's not yet ripe.

475
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,804
It's sweet. It tastes just fine.

476
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:20,913
Oh?

477
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,353
What are you doing?

478
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:49,733
It'll be okay now.

479
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,214
Where is your bundle?

480
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:03,384
Oh, no. The bundle Ms. Gyeonju gave me.

481
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:06,123
I must've lost it while we were running away.

482
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:08,353
Here it is.

483
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:09,793
You really have it?

484
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:12,994
That's great.

485
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:14,933
Why did you tease me?

486
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:17,203
My heart almost sank.

487
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:20,203
You are merciless.

488
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:22,333
I can't even tease you.

489
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:28,514
There are so many stars tonight.

490
00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:32,444
There's the Big Dipper.

491
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:34,353
Really?

492
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:46,063
Oh, right.

493
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:47,233
Oh, right, what?

494
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:50,194
Do you feel bad I can't see the stars?

495
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,034
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:54,603
I was inconsiderate.

497
00:40:58,174 --> 00:40:59,674
How many stars are there?

498
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:04,313
About one hundred million?

499
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,654
How many is one hundred million?

500
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:12,123
Lots and lots.

501
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,364
Get down now. We're back.

502
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:27,674
Wait.

503
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:34,674
Here. You need it back.

504
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:36,944
No.

505
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:41,014
I'll come for it after the rainmaking ritual.

506
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:45,284
Isn't this very precious?

507
00:41:45,784 --> 00:41:47,994
This? It's nothing much.

508
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:49,953
it's just...

509
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:53,594
an one-and-only handkerchief my mom gave me.

510
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:57,304
Is that lie true?

511
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:02,203
Okay. Come back tomorrow.

512
00:42:02,674 --> 00:42:03,904
I'll wait for you.

513
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:06,543
Okay.

514
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,244
Then...

515
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:14,183
I'll get you more peaches while Ms. Anseong's back is turned.

516
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:18,753
Give me your hand.

517
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:20,953
My hand?

518
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:20,853
Here. Take this.

519
00:43:23,924 --> 00:43:25,154
Take it.

520
00:43:29,424 --> 00:43:33,063
You'll go to pick peaches with me tomorrow, right?

521
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,864
Of course I will.

522
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:40,063
Good. You promised.

523
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:42,474
Yes.

524
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:45,804
Let's go.

525
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:27,583
His Majesty the King.

526
00:44:39,464 --> 00:44:41,094
You must be Ha Ram.

527
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:47,773
I lack in virtue and must rely on your help.

528
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:52,503
I owe your family a great debt.

529
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:55,244
Thank you.

530
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:04,023
Drawings are all about the eyes.

531
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:06,324
Your soul must be clean!

532
00:45:06,753 --> 00:45:07,793
Darn you!

533
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,594
My goodness.

534
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:11,824
What is wrong with you?

535
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:30,074
Save me. Don't kill me.

536
00:45:36,953 --> 00:45:39,724
Dad. This time,

537
00:45:39,724 --> 00:45:41,793
a really good medicine came in.

538
00:45:41,953 --> 00:45:45,393
Hang in there. Give me a little more time.

539
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,574
His Highness the Crown Prince.

540
00:46:08,654 --> 00:46:10,784
Lee Hoo. It has been a while.

541
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:11,853
(Lee Kang: King Seongjo's first son)

542
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,753
Why haven't you visited in so long?

543
00:46:14,324 --> 00:46:17,264
Your Highness, don't speak to me so politely.

544
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:19,364
There are people watching.

545
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:20,523
Who cares about that?

546
00:46:20,964 --> 00:46:23,293
We are brothers from the same mother.

547
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,764
I am so pleased to see all my younger brothers.

548
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:28,634
Your Highness.

549
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,873
Our nation's in great distress caused by...

550
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,503
the long drought and famine.

551
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:35,574
Rather than focus on pleasure,

552
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:39,043
please think more of the meaning of the upcoming rainmaking ritual.

553
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,083
Hoo.

554
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:45,023
The day I become king, I will remember your advice.

555
00:46:46,623 --> 00:46:48,424
Thank you, Your Highness.

556
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:52,724
Do you have to be so stiff?

557
00:46:53,424 --> 00:46:56,333
Yul, I did not remind the Crown Prince...

558
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,163
because he doesn't know the meaning.

559
00:46:58,503 --> 00:46:59,764
That's enough, Yul.

560
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:02,333
Hoo spoke out of concern for me.

561
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:04,543
(Lee Yul, Prince Yangmyeong: King Seongjo's third son)

562
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,003
I understand, Your Highness.

563
00:47:21,654 --> 00:47:22,724
Hoo.

564
00:47:24,163 --> 00:47:25,964
Why do you walk so fast?

565
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:28,364
Leave me alone.

566
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,594
Did what I say upset you?

567
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:33,163
Let it go, Hoo.

568
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:35,904
Yul, do you not feel anything?

569
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:38,203
About what?

570
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:39,773
We're like a guelder rose.

571
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:43,244
We can flower but we'll never bear fruit.

572
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:45,813
A flower with no life.

573
00:47:46,183 --> 00:47:48,313
Each time I meet the Crown Prince,

574
00:47:48,313 --> 00:47:49,913
I get frustrated.

575
00:47:50,654 --> 00:47:52,784
Even though it can't be helped.

576
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:57,253
Hoo.

577
00:47:57,623 --> 00:48:00,424
A guelder rose is light green when it first blooms.

578
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:05,304
It's white when in full bloom, then turns yellow before it wilts.

579
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:08,933
How can you say it has no life...

580
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,744
when it lives one so colorful?

581
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:17,074
Come with me, Hoo.

582
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:18,983
I will cheer you up.

583
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:21,654
What are you talking about?

584
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:24,224
I will show you something fantastic.

585
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:34,694
(Gyeongwon Pavilion: Late kings' portraits were kept and honored)

586
00:48:38,134 --> 00:48:40,733
Your sacred turtle talisman fell off.

587
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:43,034
(Sacred turtle: Said to live 10,000 years and chase away evil)

588
00:48:44,873 --> 00:48:46,643
Talisman are said to chase evil.

589
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,543
Father told us to keep one close at all times.

590
00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:51,183
Put it in a deep pocket.

591
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:54,114
It's a bad omen.

592
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:56,253
Why did it fall off?

593
00:48:57,753 --> 00:48:59,353
Forget about that, Hoo.

594
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:03,393
When will we ever get to see this if not now?

595
00:49:04,094 --> 00:49:08,293
This place has a really strange energy.

596
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,804
(Tablet of the First King)

597
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:30,114
(Tablet of King Gwangjo)

598
00:49:31,424 --> 00:49:33,784
He who is to be king.

599
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:37,964
He who is to be king of this land.

600
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:45,703
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

601
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:53,503
Come to me.

602
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:20,464
All rise for His Majesty.

603
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:45,384
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

604
00:51:52,824 --> 00:51:58,703
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

605
00:52:00,103 --> 00:52:02,674
Come to me.

606
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:09,643
My brother, what are you doing? You aren't supposed to touch that.

607
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:24,393
He who is to be king.

608
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,833
Come to me.

609
00:52:31,503 --> 00:52:33,233
Doesn't Grandfather's portrait...

610
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:36,833
look as if he's still alive?

611
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:39,603
He who is to be king.

612
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:43,773
He who is to be king of this land.

613
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:51,683
"Oration."

614
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:56,654
"Oh, the bright and shining spirit."

615
00:52:56,654 --> 00:53:02,233
"This great drought is harsher on our people than ever."

616
00:53:02,694 --> 00:53:05,703
"Our people cry out..."

617
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:09,503
"as they are tormented in this neverending dry spell."

618
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:15,074
"It's all due to my lack of discretion."

619
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:18,543
"Please take mercy upon this ritual..."

620
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:24,083
"and allow heavy rain to fall."

621
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:28,224
Begin.

622
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:52,944
Salamander, oh salamander

623
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:56,183
Raise the clouds

624
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:59,424
And spurt out fogs

625
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:02,623
Salamander, oh salamander

626
00:54:02,623 --> 00:54:05,724
Raise the clouds

627
00:54:05,724 --> 00:54:09,134
And spurt out fogs

628
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:13,034
Come to me.

629
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,174
He who is to be king.

630
00:54:15,174 --> 00:54:17,404
We must go now. Hurry.

631
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:29,384
He who is to be king.

632
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:34,023
I shall be with you.

633
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:53,574
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

634
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:58,114
I shall be with you.

635
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:02,313
Salamander, oh salamander

636
00:55:02,313 --> 00:55:05,554
Raise the clouds

637
00:55:05,554 --> 00:55:08,824
And spurt out fogs

638
00:55:08,824 --> 00:55:12,063
Salamander, oh salamander

639
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:15,063
Raise the clouds

640
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:18,333
And spurt out fogs

641
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:24,373
If you let sweet rain fall

642
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:29,643
I will let you go

643
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:51,833
Is it you...

644
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,063
who woke me up?

645
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:48,994
Wait, this is...

646
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:55,994
human sacrifice?

647
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:01,404
Om mani padme hum!

648
00:57:50,453 --> 00:57:51,483
Om mani padme hum.

649
00:58:14,344 --> 00:58:16,344
Where are you?

650
00:58:27,824 --> 00:58:29,523
Is it that way?

651
00:58:49,244 --> 00:58:50,313
Ha Ram.

652
00:59:04,663 --> 00:59:05,864
My goodness, look.

653
00:59:12,404 --> 00:59:13,563
- Goodness! - Goodness!

654
00:59:17,233 --> 00:59:18,273
Ha Ram.

655
00:59:18,773 --> 00:59:21,304
Oh no.

656
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:24,813
Father.

657
00:59:25,683 --> 00:59:28,014
Father.

658
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:33,753
Father!

659
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,793
A kid just fell.

660
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:37,654
- Go get him. - He just fell in the water.

661
00:59:37,654 --> 00:59:40,594
Will you go get that kid out?

662
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:43,134
- What are we going to do? - He just fell in.

663
00:59:43,134 --> 00:59:46,034
- Will someone get him? - Ha Ram...

664
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:47,864
Someone save him.

665
00:59:49,634 --> 00:59:51,304
Father.

666
00:59:56,913 --> 00:59:59,583
Father.

667
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:03,253
Your Highness!

668
01:00:04,654 --> 01:00:05,983
Escort His Highness out.

669
01:00:05,983 --> 01:00:07,023
Your Highness.

670
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:08,494
- Your Highness. - You must leave.

671
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:11,023
That was my position.

672
01:00:11,224 --> 01:00:13,123
Escort the Prince out now.

673
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:16,063
It was truly...

674
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:18,134
my seat!

675
01:00:23,904 --> 01:00:25,074
Father.

676
01:00:28,614 --> 01:00:30,474
Father.

677
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:36,483
- This way! - Go!

678
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:39,983
Escort His Highness this way!

679
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,924
- This way! - Hurry up and evacuate!

680
01:00:54,503 --> 01:00:55,733
Father...

681
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:09,884
Father...

682
01:01:23,634 --> 01:01:25,733
Rain! It's raining!

683
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:28,603
It's raining.

684
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,483
Ha Ram!

685
01:01:43,884 --> 01:01:46,083
Ha Ram!

686
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,154
It's raining!

687
01:01:50,924 --> 01:01:52,293
It's really raining!

688
01:01:56,864 --> 01:01:58,404
It was mine.

689
01:02:00,404 --> 01:02:03,474
The King's throne was mine.

690
01:02:54,154 --> 01:02:58,464
Ha Ram.

691
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,994
You have sacrificed your life...

692
01:03:02,994 --> 01:03:05,804
for the lives of thousands, tens of thousands of people.

693
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:08,733
Did you use the kid as bait...

694
01:03:08,733 --> 01:03:10,733
to lure me in?

695
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:12,344
Demon.

696
01:03:12,474 --> 01:03:15,574
Reside in this child's body.

697
01:03:15,844 --> 01:03:20,014
I'll take away the source of your energy, your eyes.

698
01:03:35,094 --> 01:03:37,393
You won't be able to use your power...

699
01:03:38,264 --> 01:03:41,163
until the day you retrieve your eyes.

700
01:03:45,273 --> 01:03:49,344
Cheon Gi.

701
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:54,583
The promised child who will save this world.

702
01:03:55,413 --> 01:04:00,284
I will leave these eyes to you for a moment.

703
01:04:05,994 --> 01:04:09,764
Make the pottery of fate.

704
01:05:16,694 --> 01:05:19,603
(Gyeonghoeru)

705
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:33,514
Look at him!

706
01:05:48,994 --> 01:05:50,134
Ram.

707
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:53,864
- My lord. - Move aside!

708
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:57,474
Ram.

709
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:01,103
Ram.

710
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:03,174
Ram!

711
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:07,413
Ram!

712
01:06:18,123 --> 01:06:19,924
Arrest the shaman now!

713
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:23,134
Your Majesty.

714
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:25,034
I'm falsely blamed, Your Majesty.

715
01:06:25,864 --> 01:06:28,503
Please give me a chance to explain, Your Majesty!

716
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:48,994
Ram.

717
01:07:00,063 --> 01:07:01,603
- Father. - Ram.

718
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:16,313
I... I can't see anything.

719
01:07:25,264 --> 01:07:26,523
Father.

720
01:07:33,534 --> 01:07:35,134
Nothing.

721
01:07:35,804 --> 01:07:39,873
I can't see anything, Father.

722
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:42,944
In the distant future,

723
01:07:43,043 --> 01:07:46,344
when the two of you are reunited,

724
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:52,083
everything will fall into its place.

725
01:07:57,153 --> 01:08:01,993
(Special thanks to Jeon Kook Hwan, Han Sang Jin and Kim Pub Lae)

726
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:12,144
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

727
01:09:01,153 --> 01:09:03,394
(Every necessary precaution was taken when filming the water scene.)

728
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,849
The only painter in this city.

729
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:07,120
The sole lady of our studio.

730
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,290
There is no use in drawing everything identically.

731
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,219
I mean that you must reflect people's hopes in the painting.

732
01:09:12,219 --> 01:09:13,389
You're here, Lord Ha.

733
01:09:13,389 --> 01:09:16,059
It'll soon be 3am. We'll begin with Vermilion Bird of the South.

734
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,899
How are you going to explain this blind man studying astrology?

735
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:22,500
She has no pride as a painter.

736
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,070
What's the charm of imitated work?

737
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:26,070
