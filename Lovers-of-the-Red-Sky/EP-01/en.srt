00:00:00,741 --> 00:00:03,291
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,879
(This drama is fictional and people or stories are not tied to reality.)

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,480
Long, long ago,

4
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:17,149
there was a time when humans lived in harmony...

5
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,990
with nature alongside beings that were not visible to the human eye.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,529
One such being was three deities dwelling in one body.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,770
They were called Samsin.

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,069
The eldest presided over birth.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,280
The second presided over death.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,809
The third presided over the balance between the two.

11
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,789
One day, the deity of death that craved more blood...

12
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,490
ate up the deity that managed balance.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,660
The balance of life and death fell,

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,830
and the world was overcome with fear and unrest.

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,069
Around this time, the Demon broke off from Samsin's body...

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,300
and lived off the evil greed of the humans.

17
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,809
A woman who had lost her lover...

18
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,380
because of the Demon's reckless madness...

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,410
completed a drawing.

20
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:20,050
Old lady Samsin responded to her plea...

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,119
and took possession of the painting,

22
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,350
and the Devil who had brought havoc on the world...

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,059
became sealed within that very painting.

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,199
And then that woman disappeared.

25
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:37,169
(Episode 1: The Red Sky)

26
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:39,750
(Dan Dynasty, First year of King Seongjo)

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,530
(King Yeongjong ruled the world through the Demon in his body,)

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,560
(but he was afraid of the bloodbath caused by the untrollable Demon...)

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,569
(that he passed down his throne to his son, Seongjo,)

30
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:49,569
(and decides to do a ritual of sealing his own portrait...)

31
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,569
(in order to get rid of the Demon.)

32
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,819
Eun O, have you heard?

33
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:07,652
That this portrait is meant to be used to contain something?

34
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,931
They extracted something devastating from the king's body,

35
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,471
and are going to seal it in here.

36
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,741
I pray to you, oh deities.

37
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,341
May my husband's painting...

38
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,570
be completed without any problems.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,381
I pray to you, oh deities.

40
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,931
This will do. Step aside.

41
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,431
But as a Seongjucheong shaman...

42
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,131
The Sealing Ceremony is held by Jokyeokjeon.

43
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,040
I understand.

44
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,669
(Hong Eun O, Gohwawon painter)

45
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,140
How can a painting be this powerful?

46
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,441
It is truly amazing.

47
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:32,580
Now it is all...

48
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,251
up to the will of the heavens.

49
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,890
Baby.

50
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,530
My baby.

51
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,260
Darling.

52
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,200
Dear Buddha.

53
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,671
Dear deities.

54
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,210
Dear Samsin. If anyone can hear me,

55
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,840
please protect my baby.

56
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,881
Samsin.

57
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,520
Please protect my baby.

58
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,561
Please protect...

59
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,150
Cheon Gi.

60
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,199
(Old lady Samsin: Gave life since the beginning of time)

61
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:31,395
Dear Cheon Gi, you were afraid, were you?

62
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,195
What is wrong? What is the matter?

63
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:09,106
Sir.

64
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:23,986
Father.

65
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:27,716
Is it truly possible to seal the Demon...

66
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,556
in a portrait of you?

67
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:34,556
That is the only way to banish the Demon from this world.

68
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:38,125
Too much blood was shed in the long war against the Demon,

69
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,895
and I will end it today.

70
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:44,505
Begin.

71
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,385
Om mani padme hum.

72
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,955
Om mani padme hum.

73
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,525
Om mani padme hum.

74
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:55,884
(The Demon: Caused death since the beginning of time)

75
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:59,594
Who dare awaken me?

76
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:03,325
Did you dare wake me up?

77
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,224
You fool!

78
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:06,695
He is our King!

79
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:09,705
The Demon must show his respect!

80
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,305
Do not look into his eyes. Do not make eye contact!

81
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:31,524
King. Step closer to me.

82
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,695
Take me in.

83
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:40,094
You can never escape me.

84
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:01,854
Hello?

85
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,524
Is anyone there?

86
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,825
(Hwacha: A goblin that lives on the energy of paintings)

87
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,035
Samsin.

88
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:08,114
Samsin, how dare you?

89
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:49,524
From now on, you shall all suffer from droughts and famine.

90
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:57,504
Your offspring shall endlessly wander in the darkness.

91
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:07,215
Your offspring shall never be able to paint again.

92
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,393
To think that he made you blind.

93
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:05,034
Then again, the Demon has always been mean.

94
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,804
Baby,

95
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:11,373
I cannot lift your curse,

96
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:17,613
but I will match you with someone who will protect you from the curse.

97
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:32,093
My Lady, you gave birth to a boy.

98
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:35,733
Baby, your name is Ram.

99
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:39,003
You are the eldest son of the noble Ha family,

100
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:40,734
Ha Ram.

101
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,643
That is a beautiful name.

102
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,493
Is something wrong?

103
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:12,473
Will this really bring peace to the world?

104
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:16,003
I am afraid the Demon will break free.

105
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,743
You do not have to worry.

106
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,873
Your kingdom will enjoy an age of peace.

107
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,843
The curse bothers me.

108
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:26,414
I mean the one about droughts and famine.

109
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,994
Giddy up.

110
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,074
What do you think you're doing?

111
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,373
Do you think you can get away with this?

112
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,503
Once the former king finds out...

113
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:51,904
The former king chose Seongjucheong.

114
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,714
You may step down now.

115
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:57,044
Slay!

116
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,414
Scatter!

117
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,723
To boil the hound once it has caught the rabbit.

118
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,374
I did what I did...

119
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:27,045
for the safety...

120
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:29,613
of the royal family and the people.

121
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:52,134
(9 years later, the 9th year of Seongjo's reign)

122
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:54,405
(The ritual was a success, but due to the curse of the Demon,)

123
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:55,873
(Dan Dynasty suffered 9 years of famine and drought.)

124
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,304
(the head priestess, Mi Su, looks for a helper...)

125
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,743
(to sacrifice for the rainmaking ritual.)

126
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,074
What does it say?

127
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,814
I can't read either. I have no idea.

128
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,353
- The king lacks virtue? - The drought is getting worse.

129
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,883
- I'm sure His Majesty has a plan. - Don't be ridiculous.

130
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,654
That's why it doesn't rain!

131
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:12,454
The drought has been going on for years!

132
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,924
- Coming through! - Father!

133
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:17,294
- Father! - Honey!

134
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:21,763
Not a single grain can leave the house.

135
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,904
Do you understand?

136
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,233
- Yes, Master. - Yes, Master.

137
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:30,374
- Oh, no. - Please.

138
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:31,905
- There's no water left. - Give us rain.

139
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:37,744
That boy has a marvelous ability.

140
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:39,655
- It's here. - Are you sure there's water here?

141
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,914
- Let's dig! - Dig!

142
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:44,954
The boy says there's water here. Hurry up and dig.

143
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:50,464
- Water... It's water! - It's water!

144
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,364
That boy must possess...

145
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,333
the energy of water.

146
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,104
We found water!

147
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,273
Father!

148
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:11,344
Hi, Ram.

149
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:13,914
Did it go well?

150
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,614
- Isn't that man... - Yes, Father.

151
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:16,783
Master Ha Sung Jin?

152
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,783
Let's go inside. Come.

153
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:21,523
So he was alive.

154
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,894
It's been a long time, Master Ha.

155
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,664
How dare you show up here?

156
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,704
Even after all these years,

157
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:37,503
I'm sure your resentment is beyond words.

158
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,743
You haven't the slightest idea.

159
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:41,844
I was under the orders of the former king.

160
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,714
Tell me why you're here right now,

161
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,884
or I'll kill you with my own hands.

162
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:48,854
I'm here for your son.

163
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,293
You little...

164
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:58,723
I'm sure you're aware that he was born with the energy of water.

165
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,364
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

166
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:02,394
Master Ha.

167
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,604
This kingdom has been suffering from droughts for nine years now.

168
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,434
We need him at the next dragon rainmaking ritual.

169
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:12,644
Shut your mouth! I don't want to hear any more. Leave right now!

170
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,894
Your powers have become stronger.

171
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:36,634
I'm the royal shaman now.

172
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,464
(Royal shaman: A shaman who performs royal rituals)

173
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,174
I'm taking your son as a helper for the ritual.

174
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,444
It's not a matter of choice.

175
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:45,844
Get prepared.

176
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:49,844
We shall leave early in the morning.

177
00:18:55,983 --> 00:19:00,594
What's the most important thing when it comes to portraits?

178
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,394
It's not the eyes that you see,

179
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:06,894
but the eyes that see you.

180
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:12,033
Guys, it's the blind ghost and her father.

181
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:16,104
My mom says they're possessed.

182
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:17,844
Possessed? Really?

183
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,043
Guys, do you believe that?

184
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:22,344
That makes no sense!

185
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:23,483
Watch this.

186
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,313
- Come and take it! - Come and take it!

187
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,983
- Give it back! - Come and take it!

188
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:32,283
- Come and take it! - Give it back! It's my father's!

189
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:34,124
- Give it back! - Come and take it!

190
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:37,823
Go away, ghost!

191
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:39,733
You beggar.

192
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:41,964
You're filthy. Get lost!

193
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:47,434
Leave my daughter, Cheon Gi, alone.

194
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,604
- Leave her alone. - What's wrong?

195
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:50,773
Father, don't do that.

196
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,073
I'm fine. Father!

197
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,414
Father, please.

198
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:55,773
I'm fine.

199
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,414
Father!

200
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:59,313
Hey, let's go!

201
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:02,354
Let's run. Hurry!

202
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,583
Let's run!

203
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,454
Move out of the way!

204
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:08,894
Move out of the way!

205
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,134
Don't look him in the eye.

206
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,233
- Never look him in the eye. - Father?

207
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,704
Don't look him in the eye.

208
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:27,144
Don't look him in the eye, never.

209
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:30,083
I sense the Demon's energy.

210
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:32,954
Don't look him in the eye.

211
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,793
Stop. Please stop, okay?

212
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,333
What's this energy?

213
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:52,333
My father isn't in his right mind.

214
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,973
Where am I?

215
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,303
Father, are you okay?

216
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:03,884
- Cheon Gi. - Father, do you recognize me?

217
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,783
- Cheon Gi. - Father.

218
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,124
My dear Cheon Gi.

219
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,293
Eun O. Hong Eun O.

220
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:21,293
Is that really you?

221
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:23,634
Were you...

222
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:26,503
alive?

223
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,704
Master Ha?

224
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,444
I'm delighted to see you again.

225
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:33,674
(Seongjucheong: An institution in charge of royal shamanic rituals)

226
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,674
Are you all right?

227
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:38,983
You seemed to throw a fit earlier.

228
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:41,053
My fits started after that day.

229
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:43,783
Now I am getting more forgetful by the day.

230
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:48,594
I am worried sick about my young daughter, Cheon Gi.

231
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:53,333
She was born in the Shinchuk Year. On that very day.

232
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:00,273
So was my son.

233
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,333
Is he all right?

234
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:08,473
Ram, why don't you go and play in the yard?

235
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:09,614
Yes, Father.

236
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:12,384
Cheon Gi, you should go out too.

237
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:15,813
Then can I stop by at the Baekyu Painters Society?

238
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:17,583
Please, father.

239
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,323
What a smart little girl.

240
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:23,394
- Ram, why don't you accompany her? - Yes, Father.

241
00:22:32,204 --> 00:22:34,134
I'm used to going there alone.

242
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:36,033
I'm not following you.

243
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:38,573
Does this area belong to you or what?

244
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,954
(Baekyu Painters Society)

245
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,424
- What's this place? - Goodness!

246
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:57,864
You really followed me?

247
00:22:57,864 --> 00:22:59,323
I walked ahead of you.

248
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,333
Is that a joke?

249
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:05,533
I said, what's this place?

250
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,973
It's the Baekyu Painters Society.

251
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,944
It's a private painting group.

252
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:12,674
A private painting group?

253
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:15,414
It means they sell their paintings.

254
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,884
The painting we're going to copy today is not an old one.

255
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:21,884
(Copying: One of the six ways to learn how to paint)

256
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:29,924
This is a painting I made at Gohwawon...

257
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:35,134
of some men I saw at the market who gambled on a cockfight.

258
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:39,333
- Oh... Chun Bok. - Yes?

259
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,973
You'll have to take over.

260
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,844
Master Choi.

261
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:49,983
Master Choi, where are you going?

262
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:57,684
All right. There are a few things you can learn from this painting.

263
00:23:57,723 --> 00:23:59,993
By the way, why are we here?

264
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,854
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

265
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:05,464
Just tell me.

266
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,134
Stop prying without giving me anything in return.

267
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,164
Do you want me to pay?

268
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:13,333
Nothing in the world is free.

269
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:14,733
Forget it.

270
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:16,773
I don't want to know.

271
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:20,813
Fine.

272
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:24,344
Try closing your eyes.

273
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,743
I don't want to.

274
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:32,354
Once you close your eyes,

275
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:34,723
you hear sounds.

276
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:51,844
Do you hear that?

277
00:24:56,844 --> 00:25:00,114
I hear the brush moving on the paper.

278
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:03,013
Swish.

279
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:04,884
Swash.

280
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,293
Goodness, now you're bragging.

281
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,323
As I listen to the sounds,

282
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,833
images arise in my mind.

283
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:17,303
And when that happens,

284
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,533
I feel good.

285
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,043
I see the world through sounds.

286
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,253
Please.

287
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:38,323
Ms. Gyeonju.

288
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:44,094
Master Choi.

289
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:46,563
Ms. Gyeonju.

290
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:47,763
Master Choi.

291
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:50,763
Cheon Gi.

292
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:52,934
I've run out of paints at home.

293
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,303
Can I take some leftover paints home?

294
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,644
Sure, go ahead.

295
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:59,404
Okay. Thank you.

296
00:26:11,924 --> 00:26:12,924
Master Choi.

297
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:15,223
What? What is it now?

298
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:19,793
Have you seen Ms. Gyeonju?

299
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,364
She said she had something for me,

300
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:24,404
but I can't find her in the kitchen.

301
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:27,104
There's a bundle in the shed.

302
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:29,204
A bundle in the shed.

303
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,303
He says there's a bundle in the shed.

304
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:34,573
Yes, there's a bundle in the shed.

305
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:37,783
What a smart boy. Will you help her find it?

306
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:39,884
Sure. Let's go, Cheon Gi.

307
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,634
Ms. Gyeonju.

308
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,604
Master Choi, the class is...

309
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,973
- I give up! - Oh, my.

310
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:05,704
- Fine, I give up! - Master Choi!

311
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:08,773
Why are you so thick?

312
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:11,144
I shouldn't have taken you in.

313
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,983
By the way,

314
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:17,854
how did you know there was a bundle in the shed?

315
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:19,823
Well...

316
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:21,594
That's...

317
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:24,424
Cheon Gi, you're here.

318
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:26,194
Ms. Gyeonju.

319
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,164
I thought you were away.

320
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,434
Well, the thing is...

321
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:34,204
Hold on a second.

322
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,904
Your jeogori is torn.

323
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,243
Give me a second. I'll go and mend it right away.

324
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:41,543
Wait here.

325
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,954
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:51,023
I get holes in my clothes all the time.

327
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,083
I thought you were the same.

328
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:56,993
Don't you have a mother either?

329
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:58,793
I do.

330
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:01,864
Why? Don't you?

331
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:04,404
She passed away...

332
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,503
on the day I was born.

333
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:22,983
What are you drawing, all of a sudden?

334
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:29,424
A star.

335
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:35,063
That looks more like a full moon to me.

336
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:38,964
To me, this is a star.

337
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:54,283
What are you doing?

338
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,013
Let's draw together.

339
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,674
Is this a star?

340
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:23,684
Yes.

341
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:25,313
The Big Dipper.

342
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:29,914
The Big Dipper.

343
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:35,493
Are you hungry?

344
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:37,723
No, I'm not.

345
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:42,993
Follow me.

346
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:56,674
You two.

347
00:29:58,743 --> 00:29:59,914
Come over here.

348
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:01,354
Us?

349
00:30:01,354 --> 00:30:04,553
Yes. You two. Come here.

350
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,624
Let me see you.

351
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,194
Here. Tomorrow,

352
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,263
you will need this.

353
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:20,704
No, it is okay. I cannot accept something like this.

354
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:22,073
What do you mean?

355
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:25,674
Oh?

356
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,243
What's wrong?

357
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:31,114
What is it?

358
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:32,583
Nothing.

359
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:35,813
I think I was mistaken.

360
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:42,053
Let's go.

361
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:47,563
Keep your hands held tight.

362
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:50,263
They finally met.

363
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:53,134
(Seongjucheong)

364
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:56,674
What brought you to Guanyang?

365
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:59,144
Fate can be so cruel.

366
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:01,374
At the next rainmaking ritual,

367
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,283
my son was selected to be the helper.

368
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,983
My son Ha Ram was born with the energy of water.

369
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:11,924
Then he is going to the Palace?

370
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,094
He must not.

371
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:19,964
What?

372
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:22,964
You found a helper for the dragon rainmaking ritual?

373
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,204
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:26,833
We are keeping him in Seongjucheong.

375
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:27,973
Who is he?

376
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:31,473
He's the son of Ha Sung Jin who was Lord of Jokyeokjeon,

377
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:34,543
and he is a special child with the energy of the water deity.

378
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:37,083
The man who sealed the Demon nine years ago?

379
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,583
He is still alive?

380
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:39,743
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:43,414
He seems to have cheated death and moved to Yangzhou.

382
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:48,293
What a relief.

383
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:51,964
However,

384
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:55,894
this time, I must sacrifice his son?

385
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:59,604
You must withstand the pain and make the decision

386
00:31:59,763 --> 00:32:01,573
for your starving people.

387
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,444
Are you saying we must sacrifice a human being?

388
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:09,743
Your Majesty.

389
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:12,013
One century ago, a life was taken at a rainmaking ritual,

390
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,813
and the deities swallowed their fury to give us rain.

391
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:18,184
How dare you say such things?

392
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:20,323
We follow Confucius' and Mencius' teachings,

393
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:22,454
and we cannot do such terrible things.

394
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:26,664
My lords. Have you already forgotten what happened nine years ago?

395
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,993
Droughts and famine have plagued us for years.

396
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:33,233
Sacrificing a life is the only way to lift the Demon's curse.

397
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:37,303
How dare a mere shaman speak her mind in this great hall?

398
00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:39,404
What do you think?

399
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,844
The heavens' will not change whatever we humans do.

400
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:46,583
It is unthinkable that they would even accept a human sacrifice.

401
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,414
I agree with you.

402
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:53,253
The dragon rainmaking ritual will be held with dignity,

403
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:56,454
but without a human sacrifice. Do you understand?

404
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:59,164
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,233
There will be no rain without a human sacrifice, Your Majesty.

406
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:07,204
Even if you all disapprove, I must go through with it.

407
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:09,634
As the royal shaman.

408
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:28,023
Hey.

409
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:31,694
What are you doing? This is what thieves do.

410
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,634
Quiet.

411
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,154
Hey.

412
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:58,083
There's someone here.

413
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,253
Don't you hear her snore?

414
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:03,994
Not bad.

415
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:05,994
Do you see the stick over there?

416
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:07,293
Yes.

417
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,333
Climb the tree.

418
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:14,833
Can't you just tell your father you're hungry?

419
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,304
There's a famine. Do you want to cause them trouble?

420
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:20,714
Okay, fine.

421
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,733
Be quiet.

422
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:48,534
Everyone here knows peach orchard's Ms. Anseong.

423
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:50,703
Why?

424
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:55,143
She has a fiery temper that makes grown men tremble in their shoes.

425
00:34:55,674 --> 00:34:57,143
That means she's dangerous.

426
00:34:57,143 --> 00:35:00,913
If she catches you, you'll never walk again.

427
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:02,183
What?

428
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:05,353
I won't do this, then. I'm coming down.

429
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,154
I want a peach.

430
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:14,594
I can't pick any because I can't see.

431
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:18,733
Okay.

432
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:08,813
Are you okay?

433
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:13,083
Who's there?

434
00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:15,194
Oh?

435
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:18,063
Who's there?

436
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:19,764
Hey, run.

437
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:20,964
Okay.

438
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:34,474
She's coming. Run faster.

439
00:36:41,054 --> 00:36:42,884
Are you okay? Let's go.

440
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:45,753
You fools. Don't you dare come back!

441
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,634
It's all your fault. If not for you,

442
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,703
we wouldn't have had to run from someone that scary.

443
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:05,844
Where are you going?

444
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:08,714
I hate you.

445
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:15,253
I never said wanted to steal someone else's peaches.

446
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:16,683
You're just the same.

447
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:19,384
Because I can't see,

448
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:22,753
because my dad's not right in his head,

449
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:27,764
because my mom died while giving birth to me,

450
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:30,333
I have no friends.

451
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:33,733
Everyone ridicules me for no reason.

452
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,534
They say I'm cursed.

453
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:41,614
I just wanted to share some peaches.

454
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,284
I'm sorry.

455
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:52,154
Whatever.

456
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:57,924
But...

457
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,563
your mom dying after you were born,

458
00:38:02,494 --> 00:38:04,804
you not being able to see,

459
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:10,034
and your dad not being right in his head...

460
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:11,873
isn't your fault.

461
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:13,404
So why...

462
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:15,674
Why? What?

463
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:17,683
You don't know anything.

464
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:20,853
You're right.

465
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:23,083
I don't know anything,

466
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:25,384
but it couldn't be helped.

467
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:31,063
All that happened to you were out of everyone's control.

468
00:38:31,663 --> 00:38:33,424
It wasn't your fault.

469
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:39,864
So don't blame yourself over...

470
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,534
what wasn't your fault.

471
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:55,054
I ran so much that I'm even more hungry now.

472
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,983
This is definitely your fault.

473
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:05,724
Here.

474
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:15,333
Darn it. It's not yet ripe.

475
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:18,304
It's sweet. It tastes just fine.

476
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:21,413
Oh?

477
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,853
What are you doing?

478
00:39:48,773 --> 00:39:50,233
It'll be okay now.

479
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,714
Where is your bundle?

480
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:03,884
Oh, no. The bundle Ms. Gyeonju gave me.

481
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:06,623
I must've lost it while we were running away.

482
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:08,853
Here it is.

483
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:10,293
You really have it?

484
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:13,494
That's great.

485
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:15,433
Why did you tease me?

486
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,703
My heart almost sank.

487
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:20,703
You are merciless.

488
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:22,833
I can't even tease you.

489
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:29,014
There are so many stars tonight.

490
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:32,944
There's the Big Dipper.

491
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:34,853
Really?

492
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:46,563
Oh, right.

493
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:47,733
Oh, right, what?

494
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,694
Do you feel bad I can't see the stars?

495
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,534
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:55,103
I was inconsiderate.

497
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:00,174
How many stars are there?

498
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:04,813
About one hundred million?

499
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:08,154
How many is one hundred million?

500
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:12,623
Lots and lots.

501
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,864
Get down now. We're back.

502
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:28,174
Wait.

503
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:35,174
Here. You need it back.

504
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:37,444
No.

505
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:41,514
I'll come for it after the rainmaking ritual.

506
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:45,784
Isn't this very precious?

507
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:48,494
This? It's nothing much.

508
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:50,453
it's just...

509
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:54,094
an one-and-only handkerchief my mom gave me.

510
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:57,804
Is that lie true?

511
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:02,703
Okay. Come back tomorrow.

512
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:04,404
I'll wait for you.

513
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,043
Okay.

514
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:10,744
Then...

515
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:14,683
I'll get you more peaches while Ms. Anseong's back is turned.

516
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,253
Give me your hand.

517
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:21,453
My hand?

518
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:21,353
Here. Take this.

519
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:25,654
Take it.

520
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:33,563
You'll go to pick peaches with me tomorrow, right?

521
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,364
Of course I will.

522
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:40,563
Good. You promised.

523
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:42,974
Yes.

524
00:43:45,273 --> 00:43:46,304
Let's go.

525
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:28,083
His Majesty the King.

526
00:44:39,964 --> 00:44:41,594
You must be Ha Ram.

527
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:48,273
I lack in virtue and must rely on your help.

528
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:53,003
I owe your family a great debt.

529
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:55,744
Thank you.

530
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:04,523
Drawings are all about the eyes.

531
00:45:04,983 --> 00:45:06,824
Your soul must be clean!

532
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:08,293
Darn you!

533
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,094
My goodness.

534
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,324
What is wrong with you?

535
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:30,574
Save me. Don't kill me.

536
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:40,224
Dad. This time,

537
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:42,293
a really good medicine came in.

538
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:45,893
Hang in there. Give me a little more time.

539
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,074
His Highness the Crown Prince.

540
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:11,284
Lee Hoo. It has been a while.

541
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:12,353
(Lee Kang: King Seongjo's first son)

542
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,253
Why haven't you visited in so long?

543
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:17,764
Your Highness, don't speak to me so politely.

544
00:46:18,393 --> 00:46:19,864
There are people watching.

545
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:21,023
Who cares about that?

546
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:23,793
We are brothers from the same mother.

547
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,264
I am so pleased to see all my younger brothers.

548
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:29,134
Your Highness.

549
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:32,373
Our nation's in great distress caused by...

550
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,003
the long drought and famine.

551
00:46:34,444 --> 00:46:36,074
Rather than focus on pleasure,

552
00:46:36,344 --> 00:46:39,543
please think more of the meaning of the upcoming rainmaking ritual.

553
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:41,583
Hoo.

554
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:45,523
The day I become king, I will remember your advice.

555
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:48,924
Thank you, Your Highness.

556
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:53,224
Do you have to be so stiff?

557
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:56,833
Yul, I did not remind the Crown Prince...

558
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,663
because he doesn't know the meaning.

559
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:00,264
That's enough, Yul.

560
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:02,833
Hoo spoke out of concern for me.

561
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:05,043
(Lee Yul, Prince Yangmyeong: King Seongjo's third son)

562
00:47:05,043 --> 00:47:06,503
I understand, Your Highness.

563
00:47:22,154 --> 00:47:23,224
Hoo.

564
00:47:24,663 --> 00:47:26,464
Why do you walk so fast?

565
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:28,864
Leave me alone.

566
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,094
Did what I say upset you?

567
00:47:31,603 --> 00:47:33,663
Let it go, Hoo.

568
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:36,404
Yul, do you not feel anything?

569
00:47:37,474 --> 00:47:38,703
About what?

570
00:47:38,703 --> 00:47:40,273
We're like a guelder rose.

571
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:43,744
We can flower but we'll never bear fruit.

572
00:47:44,714 --> 00:47:46,313
A flower with no life.

573
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:48,813
Each time I meet the Crown Prince,

574
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:50,413
I get frustrated.

575
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:53,284
Even though it can't be helped.

576
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:57,753
Hoo.

577
00:47:58,123 --> 00:48:00,924
A guelder rose is light green when it first blooms.

578
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:05,804
It's white when in full bloom, then turns yellow before it wilts.

579
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,433
How can you say it has no life...

580
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,244
when it lives one so colorful?

581
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,574
Come with me, Hoo.

582
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:19,483
I will cheer you up.

583
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,154
What are you talking about?

584
00:48:22,154 --> 00:48:24,724
I will show you something fantastic.

585
00:48:32,063 --> 00:48:35,194
(Gyeongwon Pavilion: Late kings' portraits were kept and honored)

586
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:41,233
Your sacred turtle talisman fell off.

587
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,534
(Sacred turtle: Said to live 10,000 years and chase away evil)

588
00:48:45,373 --> 00:48:47,143
Talisman are said to chase evil.

589
00:48:47,143 --> 00:48:50,043
Father told us to keep one close at all times.

590
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:51,683
Put it in a deep pocket.

591
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:54,614
It's a bad omen.

592
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:56,753
Why did it fall off?

593
00:48:58,253 --> 00:48:59,853
Forget about that, Hoo.

594
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:03,893
When will we ever get to see this if not now?

595
00:49:04,594 --> 00:49:08,793
This place has a really strange energy.

596
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:18,304
(Tablet of the First King)

597
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:30,614
(Tablet of King Gwangjo)

598
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:34,284
He who is to be king.

599
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:38,464
He who is to be king of this land.

600
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:46,203
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

601
00:49:51,744 --> 00:49:54,003
Come to me.

602
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:20,964
All rise for His Majesty.

603
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:45,884
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

604
00:51:53,324 --> 00:51:59,203
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

605
00:52:00,603 --> 00:52:03,174
Come to me.

606
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:10,143
My brother, what are you doing? You aren't supposed to touch that.

607
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:24,893
He who is to be king.

608
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,333
Come to me.

609
00:52:32,003 --> 00:52:33,733
Doesn't Grandfather's portrait...

610
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:37,333
look as if he's still alive?

611
00:52:37,873 --> 00:52:40,103
He who is to be king.

612
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:44,273
He who is to be king of this land.

613
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:52,183
"Oration."

614
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:57,154
"Oh, the bright and shining spirit."

615
00:52:57,154 --> 00:53:02,733
"This great drought is harsher on our people than ever."

616
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:06,203
"Our people cry out..."

617
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:10,003
"as they are tormented in this neverending dry spell."

618
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:15,574
"It's all due to my lack of discretion."

619
00:53:15,574 --> 00:53:19,043
"Please take mercy upon this ritual..."

620
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:24,583
"and allow heavy rain to fall."

621
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:28,724
Begin.

622
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:53,444
Salamander, oh salamander

623
00:53:53,444 --> 00:53:56,683
Raise the clouds

624
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:59,924
And spurt out fogs

625
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:03,123
Salamander, oh salamander

626
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:06,224
Raise the clouds

627
00:54:06,224 --> 00:54:09,634
And spurt out fogs

628
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:13,534
Come to me.

629
00:54:13,534 --> 00:54:15,674
He who is to be king.

630
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:17,904
We must go now. Hurry.

631
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,884
He who is to be king.

632
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:34,523
I shall be with you.

633
00:54:49,003 --> 00:54:54,074
He who is to be king. He who is to be king of this land.

634
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:58,614
I shall be with you.

635
00:54:59,614 --> 00:55:02,813
Salamander, oh salamander

636
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:06,054
Raise the clouds

637
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:09,324
And spurt out fogs

638
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:12,563
Salamander, oh salamander

639
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:15,563
Raise the clouds

640
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,833
And spurt out fogs

641
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:24,873
If you let sweet rain fall

642
00:55:24,873 --> 00:55:30,143
I will let you go

643
00:55:50,494 --> 00:55:52,333
Is it you...

644
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,563
who woke me up?

645
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:49,494
Wait, this is...

646
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:56,494
human sacrifice?

647
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:01,904
Om mani padme hum!

648
00:57:50,953 --> 00:57:51,983
Om mani padme hum.

649
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:16,844
Where are you?

650
00:58:28,324 --> 00:58:30,023
Is it that way?

651
00:58:49,744 --> 00:58:50,813
Ha Ram.

652
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:06,364
My goodness, look.

653
00:59:12,904 --> 00:59:14,063
- Goodness! - Goodness!

654
00:59:17,733 --> 00:59:18,773
Ha Ram.

655
00:59:19,273 --> 00:59:21,804
Oh no.

656
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:25,313
Father.

657
00:59:26,183 --> 00:59:28,514
Father.

658
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:34,253
Father!

659
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,293
A kid just fell.

660
00:59:36,293 --> 00:59:38,154
- Go get him. - He just fell in the water.

661
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:41,094
Will you go get that kid out?

662
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:43,634
- What are we going to do? - He just fell in.

663
00:59:43,634 --> 00:59:46,534
- Will someone get him? - Ha Ram...

664
00:59:46,534 --> 00:59:48,364
Someone save him.

665
00:59:50,134 --> 00:59:51,804
Father.

666
00:59:57,413 --> 01:00:00,083
Father.

667
01:00:01,784 --> 01:00:03,753
Your Highness!

668
01:00:05,154 --> 01:00:06,483
Escort His Highness out.

669
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:07,523
Your Highness.

670
01:00:07,523 --> 01:00:08,994
- Your Highness. - You must leave.

671
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:11,523
That was my position.

672
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:13,623
Escort the Prince out now.

673
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:16,563
It was truly...

674
01:00:17,134 --> 01:00:18,634
my seat!

675
01:00:24,404 --> 01:00:25,574
Father.

676
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:30,974
Father.

677
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:36,983
- This way! - Go!

678
01:00:38,824 --> 01:00:40,483
Escort His Highness this way!

679
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,424
- This way! - Hurry up and evacuate!

680
01:00:55,003 --> 01:00:56,233
Father...

681
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:10,384
Father...

682
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:26,233
Rain! It's raining!

683
01:01:27,534 --> 01:01:29,103
It's raining.

684
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,983
Ha Ram!

685
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:46,583
Ha Ram!

686
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:49,654
It's raining!

687
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:52,793
It's really raining!

688
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:58,904
It was mine.

689
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:03,974
The King's throne was mine.

690
01:02:54,654 --> 01:02:58,964
Ha Ram.

691
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,494
You have sacrificed your life...

692
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:06,304
for the lives of thousands, tens of thousands of people.

693
01:03:07,503 --> 01:03:09,233
Did you use the kid as bait...

694
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:11,233
to lure me in?

695
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:12,844
Demon.

696
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:16,074
Reside in this child's body.

697
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:20,514
I'll take away the source of your energy, your eyes.

698
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,893
You won't be able to use your power...

699
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:41,663
until the day you retrieve your eyes.

700
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:49,844
Cheon Gi.

701
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:55,083
The promised child who will save this world.

702
01:03:55,913 --> 01:04:00,784
I will leave these eyes to you for a moment.

703
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:10,264
Make the pottery of fate.

704
01:05:17,194 --> 01:05:20,103
(Gyeonghoeru)

705
01:05:32,214 --> 01:05:34,014
Look at him!

706
01:05:49,494 --> 01:05:50,634
Ram.

707
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:54,364
- My lord. - Move aside!

708
01:05:56,804 --> 01:05:57,974
Ram.

709
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:01,603
Ram.

710
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:03,674
Ram!

711
01:06:06,043 --> 01:06:07,913
Ram!

712
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:20,424
Arrest the shaman now!

713
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,634
Your Majesty.

714
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:25,534
I'm falsely blamed, Your Majesty.

715
01:06:26,364 --> 01:06:29,003
Please give me a chance to explain, Your Majesty!

716
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:49,494
Ram.

717
01:07:00,563 --> 01:07:02,103
- Father. - Ram.

718
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:16,813
I... I can't see anything.

719
01:07:25,764 --> 01:07:27,023
Father.

720
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,634
Nothing.

721
01:07:36,304 --> 01:07:40,373
I can't see anything, Father.

722
01:07:41,043 --> 01:07:43,444
In the distant future,

723
01:07:43,543 --> 01:07:46,844
when the two of you are reunited,

724
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:52,583
everything will fall into its place.

725
01:07:57,653 --> 01:08:02,493
(Special thanks to Jeon Kook Hwan, Han Sang Jin and Kim Pub Lae)

726
01:08:09,474 --> 01:08:12,644
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

727
01:09:01,653 --> 01:09:03,894
(Every necessary precaution was taken when filming the water scene.)

728
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,349
The only painter in this city.

729
01:09:06,349 --> 01:09:07,620
The sole lady of our studio.

730
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,790
There is no use in drawing everything identically.

731
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,719
I mean that you must reflect people's hopes in the painting.

732
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:13,889
You're here, Lord Ha.

733
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:16,559
It'll soon be 3am. We'll begin with Vermilion Bird of the South.

734
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:20,399
How are you going to explain this blind man studying astrology?

735
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,000
She has no pride as a painter.

736
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,570
What's the charm of imitated work?

737
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,570
