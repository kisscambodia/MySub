00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,990
<i>Episode 8</i>

4
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,680
Xiao Jun.

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,800
Do you still like

6
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,110
Xuan Xuan from your school?

7
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,960
What do you like about her?

8
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,509
I like everything about her.

9
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,120
Why?

10
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,000
Is she the prettiest girl

11
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,440
in your school?

12
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,350
I don't think so.

13
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,720
Then why do you like her?

14
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,229
Why did you suddenly ask me this?

15
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,760
Luo Xiao Jun.

16
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,800
How do you feel?

17
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,240
What say you?

18
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,840
I think you're doing really well.

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,000
Xia Chu.

20
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,920
Change his dressing.

21
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,890
Yes.

22
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,550
What are you doing?

23
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,360
We're discussing about the next step.

24
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,120
You're really in the mood.

25
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,790
All right. Let's go to Room 3.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,680
Is it so difficult to see a doctor?

27
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,510
Let's go.

28
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,040
Let's go. It's time
to see the psychiatrist.

29
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,960
Don't mess with me.

30
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,950
I'm not messing with you.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,560
-It's your turn.
-It's my turn.

32
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,490
Liang Mu Ze.

33
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,640
The  white blood cell count
of patient no. 18 is still low.

34
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,590
Pay attention to him.

35
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,570
If your family like it,

36
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,340
just let me know.

37
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,720
I can bring more for you.

38
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,870
Don't be shy.

39
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,480
What are you doing?

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,540
Dr Zhang.

41
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,520
Don't sell it too hard.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,180
You're going to make our nurses

43
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,490
go bankrupt soon.

44
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,920
That's impossible.
These handmade reusable bag

45
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,600
are designed by me.

46
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,790
-It's a present for the nurses.
-Is it?

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,510
It's to thank them
for taking care of my son.

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,030
Thank you so much.

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,240
We're getting back to work.

50
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,750
Thank you for the present.

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,680
You should get back to work. By the way,

52
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,010
-it's for everyone.
-Thank you, Ms Meng Zhen.

53
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,220
The patterns and designs
are my ideas.

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,340
You won't find it anywhere else.

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,620
I hope you like it.

56
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,810
Thank you.

57
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,000
You're welcome.

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,360
I don't get one?

59
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,850
It's rare to see men buying reusable bag.

60
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,530
Hence, I didn't make one for you.

61
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,680
However,

62
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,980
I know that doctors are hygienic.

63
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,890
Therefore,

64
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,870
I made you a soap.

65
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,040
I hope you like it.

66
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,440
You made a soap for me?

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Look,

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,750
my surname is carved on the soap.

69
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:27,290
Thank you so much.

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,380
You're welcome.

71
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,240
It's personally customised
and it's the only and only in the world.

72
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,470
I'll keep it well.

73
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,350
Sure.

74
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,600
By the way, we just checked on Xiao Jun.

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,750
He's recovering well.

76
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,360
We changed his dressing today.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,280
If everything goes well,

78
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,640
he can be discharged on Monday.

79
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,680
Really?

80
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,620
Thank you so much!

81
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,640
Okay, got it.

82
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,159
I'll come now.

83
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,720
There's a patient in the emergency ward.

84
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,230
A metal pierced through his chest.

85
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,200
I'm going down to have a look.

86
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,730
Take care of your respective patients.

87
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,030
-Call me if anything.
-Yes.

88
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,340
Okay, you go ahead.

89
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,170
Ms Meng Zhen, we're getting back to work.

90
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,550
Okay, go now.

91
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,270
Have you fallen in love with someone?

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,240
No.

93
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,460
Say it.

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,510
It's a secret between us.

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,160
I won't tell Ms Zhen.

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,820
I'm not you. I'm not scared of your mum.

97
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,880
Who are you scared of?

98
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm scared of you the most.

99
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,780
Xiao Jun.

100
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,510
It's time to change dressing.

101
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,650
Here.

102
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,060
Pull your shirt up.

103
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,730
Let me help you.

104
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,860
Go away!

105
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,270
Don't touch me. Get out now!

106
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll leave after changing the dressing.

107
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,760
Here, be good.

108
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,900
I don't want you to do it.

109
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,260
I don't want you to do it.

110
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,760
Get out!

111
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,400
Get out!

112
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,210
Xiao Jun.

113
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,380
Xiao Jun, what's wrong?

114
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,640
Dr Xia, what's going on?

115
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,190
Nothing.

116
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,750
Dr Xia, you need to learn

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,610
how to respect your patient.

118
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,520
What if the patient is wrong?

119
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,200
If he stays stubborn,

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,040
he will bear greater pain in the end.

121
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,680
Dr Xia, it's just changing the dressing.

122
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,800
Why would he suffer from greater pain?

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,400
Nothing.

124
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,640
I'll come again later.

125
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,970
Sure.

126
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,710
<i>Why hasn't medical order
for patient no. 17 here yet?</i>

127
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,670
<i>You're the slowest. Speed up.</i>

128
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,960
No...

129
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,620
My desktop went dead just now.

130
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,840
I just got it repaired.

131
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,400
<i>Explain to the patient!</i>

132
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,240
Can you please change dressing
for Luo Xiao Jun on behalf of me?

133
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,960
No, I'm occupied.

134
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,800
I'll prepare the medical order for you.

135
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,250
You can leave all the medical orders
that has to be done within this week

136
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,320
to me.

137
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,920
Two weeks worth of medical orders.

138
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,380
It's a deal.

139
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,120
It's done.

140
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,840
-Thank you, Dr Xiao.
-No problem.

141
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,710
Thank you.

142
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,350
By the way, Xiao Jun,

143
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,520
tell me the truth.

144
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,110
Why won't you let Dr Xia
to change your dressing?

145
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,720
It's none of your business.

146
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,360
It's none of your business too.

147
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,200
Luo Xiao Jun!

148
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
What's wrong with you?

149
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,850
You're being rude.

150
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,040
Liang Mu Ze.

151
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,159
Will you take care of Ms Zhen forever?

152
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,120
It's none of your business.

153
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,330
Xiao Jun.

154
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,040
You haven't told me

155
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,480
what you want for lunch.

156
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,310
Will you, Liang Mu Ze?

157
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,920
Of course. Do you have to ask?

158
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,520
I want braised pork ribs.
Two portions please.

159
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,600
Ms Zhen, go with Liang Mu Ze.

160
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,320
Why are you so happy?

161
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,480
Liang Mu Ze promised
to take care of Ms Zhen forever.

162
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,540
What does that mean?

163
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,560
That means I took note of it.

164
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,360
I know why you hate me.

165
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,240
It's because of Liang Mu Ze, right?

166
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,040
Listen.

167
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,680
Ever since we met each other
for the first time,

168
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,400
I've always been your doctor.

169
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,039
Now, I'm still your doctor.

170
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,830
I'll be responsible of your health

171
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,559
until you're discharged.

172
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,559
Please don't hate me.

173
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,429
It's nothing to do with Liang Mu Ze.

174
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,919
It's for your own good.

175
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,390
If

176
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,560
you hold grudges against me for nothing,

177
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,760
you may hurt yourself in the end.

178
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,850
Please buy me a bouquet of flowers.

179
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,110
What?

180
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,940
In the name of Liang Mu Ze.

181
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,360
Send a bouquet of flowers to my mum.

182
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,960
That way, I'll believe in you.

183
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,240
Will you behave and receive treatment?

184
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,210
Yes.

185
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,070
That's a deal.

186
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,360
That's a deal.

187
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,520
-Are you going back to the camp later?
-Yes.

188
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,640
Xiao Jun becomes more sensitive
after falling sick.

189
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,970
Don't take what he said just now

190
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,240
to heart.

191
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,270
Meng Zhen.

192
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,000
Xiao Jun is a kid but I'm not.

193
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,800
I'll honour my words.

194
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,520
You don't have to do that, Mu Ze.

195
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,000
It's been eight years.
It's more than enough.

196
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,380
I can take care of myself.

197
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,960
Xiao Jun has grown up.

198
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,680
I can take care of him by myself.

199
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,160
As for you,

200
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,880
you should move on.

201
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
You should go on with dating,
getting married

202
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,680
and have your own children.

203
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,990
You should find your own life purpose.

204
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,810
Taking care of you is my life purpose.

205
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,700
Do you plan to live like this
for the rest of your life?

206
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,350
Both of us know that
it shouldn't be like this.

207
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,980
Sometimes,

208
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,550
inappropriate promises
could be a form of disturbance

209
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,600
to a kid.

210
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,030
Mum.

211
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,440
Xiao Jun.

212
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,980
Xiao Jun, why are you here?

213
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,640
Didn't I tell you to wait in the ward?

214
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,110
It's for you.

215
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,190
Where did you get the flowers?

216
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,880
Liang Mu Ze got it in secret.

217
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,400
He wants to give you a surprise. Look.

218
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,750
It's a card with his name on it.

219
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,960
Hurry up, Liang Mu Ze.

220
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,620
Aren't you going to propose?

221
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,150
The flowers are so beautiful.

222
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,320
I like it.

223
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,110
I like it no matter who the sender is.

224
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,640
However...

225
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,600
We can't get married.

226
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,470
Why?

227
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,440
You promised
you will take care of her forever.

228
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,200
I'll take care of both of you forever.

229
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,960
However,
it's different from getting married.

230
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,160
Why?

231
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,360
Is it because you don't like my mum?

232
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,060
Here, come here.

233
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,050
Listen.

234
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,160
Come here.

235
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,230
Sit down.

236
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,990
Let me tell you.

237
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,670
Marriage is something important.

238
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,230
It's not as simple as you imagine.

239
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,790
It's not just about liking someone or not.

240
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,870
There are more elements to it.

241
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,240
Therefore,

242
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,450
I can't marry Liang Mu Ze.

243
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,350
It's not going to happen.

244
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,680
Can you understand?

245
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,630
He promised to take care of you forever.

246
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,470
He said that out of kindness.

247
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,280
However, taking care of us
is not his responsibility.

248
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,190
It's a success!

249
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,720
Stop crying, Xiao Jun.

250
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,480
Stop crying.

251
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,780
Xiao Jun.

252
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,940
What's wrong?

253
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,690
What's wrong?

254
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,160
Was it you?

255
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,920
Yes.

256
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,920
Are you crazy?

257
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,520
Ridiculous.

258
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,780
Yes.

259
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,100
I'm crazy.

260
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,120
Dr Xia.

261
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,120
You should apologise to her.

262
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,520
Dr Xia.

263
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,550
Dr Xia, sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.

264
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,380
It's okay. I'm going to meet a friend
at the emergency department.

265
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,480
Be careful!

266
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,020
Dr Xia, are you okay?

267
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,160
Put up with it.

268
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,280
Your bone is fine

269
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,680
but the ligament is injured.

270
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,760
If it's not fixed,

271
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,280
it won't recover.

272
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,130
You're a doctor.

273
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,520
You should know the consequences.

274
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,060
How long will it take to recover?

275
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,470
It will take about a week.

276
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,510
Don't walk too much and rest well.

277
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,880
Can I go to work tomorrow?

278
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Go to work?

279
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,480
Do you plan to give up
on conducting surgery?

280
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,060
We'll talk about it
when your leg has fully recovered.

281
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,400
You may get back to work.

282
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,980
I can handle it.

283
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,940
I'm going back to the unit at 6 o'clock.

284
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,170
You should come back with me.

285
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,530
Why?

286
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,560
You'll be staying there for a few days.

287
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,630
Why?

288
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,080
Why? He's worried about you.

289
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,580
No.

290
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,840
I promised Zhang Yi Chi

291
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,500
to take good care of you.

292
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,810
It's done.

293
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,070
Go get a wheelchair.

294
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,100
It's not needed.

295
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,480
Liang Mu Ze!

296
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,230
Military officers have great stamina.

297
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,080
Liang Mu Ze, let me down!

298
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,300
Put me down!

299
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,100
Stop moving.

300
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,320
I won't be responsible if you fall.

301
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,530
Put me down!

302
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,260
We're in the hospital.

303
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,880
You're creating a scene.

304
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,080
Stop looking around.

305
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,270
-Look at them.
-You...

306
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,740
Let me down!

307
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,660
Stop moving.

308
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,070
I...

309
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,900
Let go of me! I want to get down!

310
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,750
You're abducting me.

311
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,840
I'm going to scream for help.

312
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,110
If you don't mind embarrassing yourself,
you may do so.

313
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,080
I don't mind.

314
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,170
Should we follow them?

315
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,800
Go back to the office.

316
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,590
Mi Gu?

317
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,560
Mi Gu!

318
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,540
Mi Gu!

319
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,920
Mi Gu!

320
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,700
I'll be there in half an hour.

321
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,440
Roll down the car window.

322
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,470
Mi Gu!

323
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,160
Mi Gu!

324
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,120
He's gone?

325
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,890
Yes.

326
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,780
He requested to be discharged.

327
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,960
Didn't you know?

328
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,640
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

329
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,030
One, two, three, four!

330
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,620
One, two, three, four!

331
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,380
One, two, three, four!

332
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,360
One, two, three, four!

333
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,120
I think I just saw Captain Liang's car.

334
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,790
Stand still!

335
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,200
Tian Yong.

336
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,420
Tian Yong.

337
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,890
Captain.

338
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,310
Dr Xia?

339
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,090
Yes.

340
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,480
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

341
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,750
Good day, Mrs Liang.

342
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,140
Good day, Mrs Liang.

343
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,240
Good day, Mrs Liang.

344
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,530
Good day, Mrs Liang!

345
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,660
Good day, Mrs Liang.

346
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,920
Good day, Mrs Liang.

347
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,569
What are you doing?

348
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,190
Who is Mrs Liang?

349
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,150
Brigade Commander.

350
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,150
Good day, Brigade Commander!

351
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,480
I told you to come back at 6 o'clock.

352
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,359
You're late 20 minutes.

353
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,339
What happened?

354
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,349
Reporting.

355
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,349
Chief.

356
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,250
Chief.

357
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,240
He was late because
he kept me company at the hospital.

358
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,480
Who are you?

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,700
Reporting to Brigade Commander.

360
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,160
She is a cardiac surgeon
from 109 Hospital.

361
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,250
Reporting.

362
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,630
Dr Xia was my saviour.

363
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,650
She saved me

364
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,920
when we were in Isaia.

365
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,680
It's you, Dr Xia.

366
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,450
Hello.

367
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,060
I have been wanting
to thank you face to face.

368
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,960
I didn't expect to see you today.

369
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,580
Chief, don't mention it.

370
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
You may call me Xia Chu.

371
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,200
Sure, Xia Chu.

372
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,120
What happened?

373
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,120
I accidentally fell down.

374
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,770
Captain Liang ran into me
in the hospital and hence,

375
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,240
he took me in.

376
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,940
Took you...

377
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
Look at me.

378
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,710
I got it now.

379
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,590
Xia Chu.

380
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,360
You're going to stay here
for a while, right?

381
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,870
-Yes.
-No.

382
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,500
She'll stay.

383
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
Chief.

384
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,040
The military camp
is full of confidential information.

385
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm an outsider.

386
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,230
You're not an outsider.

387
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,190
Xia Chu.

388
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,560
You're Tian Yong's saviour, right?

389
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,000
That means you're the saviour
of Special Forces Brigade too.

390
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,620
Am I right?

391
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,890
Yes!

392
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,450
-Liang Mu Ze.
-Yes!

393
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,870
-Take care of Xia Chu.
-Yes!

394
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,260
Chief.

395
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,720
I need to get back to the hospital.
I didn't apply for leave.

396
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,560
You don't have to worry about that.

397
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,280
Just stay here, relax

398
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,410
and nurse your wound.

399
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,400
I'll talk to your boss later.

400
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,300
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

401
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,680
Send Xia Chu to the guest house.

402
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,480
Yes!

403
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,360
-I'll send her there now.
-Go.

404
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,110
-Thank you, Chief.
-Goodbye, Xia Chu.

405
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,840
I'm leaving, Brigade Commander.

406
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,640
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

407
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,160
I've a meeting
at the Brigade Headquarters.

408
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,370
So, please send dinner
and daily necessities

409
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,680
to Dr Xia.

410
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,160
Get her a few pair of clothes too.

411
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,200
Will do, sir.

412
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,040
-Tian Yong!
-Yes!

413
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,080
Sing the cadence while marching.

414
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,520
Yes!

415
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,480
Turn to the rear and march!

416
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,680
♫ Unity is strength ♫

417
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,120
Ready, sing!

418
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:03,000
♫ Unity is strength ♫

419
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,560
Liang Mu Ze, I don't want to stay here!

420
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,340
You're not going to stay here.

421
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,670
I want to go home.

422
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,990
You'd better not do that.

423
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,200
Why?

424
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,050
Because I took you in.

425
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,280
I was giving you face.

426
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,200
I said that because he's your boss.

427
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,970
In fact, I'm kidnapped by you.

428
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,080
Don't act innocent.

429
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,080
Fine, no matter what,

430
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,440
you can only leave after you've recovered.

431
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,790
Liang Mu Ze.

432
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,250
Are you worried

433
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,160
it'd be difficult to explain
to Mr Zhang Yi Chi?

434
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,970
It's okay.

435
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,490
You don't have to take it to heart.

436
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,920
I can explain for you.

437
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,050
Just let me go, okay?

438
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,920
Let me survive on my own, okay?

439
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,380
What does that mean?

440
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,240
Just how much do you loathe

441
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,600
military camp and Special Forces soldiers?

442
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,390
No matter how much you loathe us,

443
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,350
you have to put up with us.

444
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,530
It's nothing to do with military camp
and the Special Forces!

445
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,680
I just want to stay alone!

446
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,960
I just want to go home!

447
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,420
I don't want to stand in your way

448
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,020
and being called crazy.
Can't you just let me go?

449
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,220
No.

450
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,170
Why?

451
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,020
That's my house.

452
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,200
I have the final say on
whether you can go back.

453
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,360
Attention! At ease.

454
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,250
Xia Chu.

455
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,920
Stop crying.

456
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,590
Xia Chu.

457
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,490
Stop crying.

458
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,050
Stop crying.

459
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,230
Xia Chu.

460
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,230
Is the medicine not working?

461
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,240
<i>Yes, she's been crying.</i>

462
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,390
Where are you?

463
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,760
I'll check on her.

464
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,960
We're in the military camp.

465
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,520
Are you sure that her bone is fine?

466
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,560
Don't worry.

467
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,880
The diagnosis by Orthopaedic Department

468
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,480
is surely accurate.

469
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,910
<i>Furthermore, even if she injured
her bone,</i>

470
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,340
a minor outpatient treatment
wouldn't make her cry.

471
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,470
Be honest.

472
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,150
Did you bully her?

473
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,320
How is Xiao Jun doing?

474
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,690
<i>I've just done with my work.</i>

475
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,840
I'm going to check on him.

476
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,180
<i>All right, give me a call if anything.</i>

477
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,470
You should take care of yourself.

478
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,010
<i>Since you brought her back,</i>

479
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,310
<i>you should take care of her.</i>

480
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,890
<i>When you're dealing with a lady,</i>

481
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,280
you have to be gentle, okay?

482
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,880
She's injured

483
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,920
but her parents are not around.

484
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,170
<i>She must be fragile at the moment.</i>

485
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,970
<i>She can't take your cold treatment.</i>

486
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,520
All right, I've to go.

487
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,150
He brought her back.

488

490

Have some food.

491
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,390
Is it sweet?

492
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,240
Did I scare Liang Mu Ze away?

493
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,430
He's not made of paper.

494
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,920
He's gone back to the military camp.

495
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,300
No.

496
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,840
I almost died

497
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,810
from the illness.

498
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,140
I had two surgeries.

499
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,350
My heart is problematic.

500
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,120
You're all right.

501
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,080
You've recovered, okay?

502
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,960
Nothing will happen to you.

503
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,720
No one can predict the future.

504
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,260
If one day

505
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,990
I leave this world just like dad,

506
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,840
I hope

507
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,700
someone can keep you company

508
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,930
and take care of you.

509
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,720
Otherwise, you'll be lonely.

510
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,560
You'll be sad for sure.

511
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,570
That's why I lied to you

512
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,240
and claimed that the flower
was from Liang Mu Ze.

513
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,530
I like him.

514
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,960
I thought you liked him too.

515
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,790
I didn't lie on purpose.

516
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,870
I know.

517
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,060
You will be fine.

518
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,120
You will be fine.

519
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,720
You'll always be by my side.

520
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,900
Don't think too much, okay?

521
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,500
I know.

522
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,390
You will be fine.

523
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,680
Are you doing laundry?

524
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,360
Dr Zhang.

525
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,620
Done with work?

526
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,010
What's wrong?

527
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,880
Nothing.

528
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,590
The laundry detergent
accidentally got into my eyes.

529
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,780
That's a little far-fetched.

530
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,000
Did you cry?

531
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,680
Xiao Jun bought me a bouquet of flower

532
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,000
in the afternoon.

533
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,960
He told Liang Mu Ze to propose to me.

534
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,550
Propose to you?

535
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,360
Were you touched?

536
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,600
It's never crossed my mind that

537
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,520
my son would be the match-maker for me.

538
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,690
He said,

539
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,480
he's worried that if he left the world,

540
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,680
I would be lonely.

541
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,300
Actually that's a good idea.

542
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,960
Liang Mu Ze is a nice man.

543
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,840
I think you should consider him.

544
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,670
What? Liang Mu Ze?

545
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,800
Yes.

546
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,280
How is that possible?

547
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,110
Listen.

548
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,160
I embroidered a piece of table cloth
a few years back.

549
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,990
It's a blue bird.

550
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,870
I really liked it.

551
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,910
However, one day,
I accidentally spilled juice on it.

552
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,920
It's tainted.

553
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,750
I couldn't get rid of the stain
no matter how hard I tried.

554
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,030
I thought

555
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,880
I could produce another one

556
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,670
but I couldn't do it.

557
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,140
When the patterns are similar,

558
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,460
I can't help but keep comparing the both.

559
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,840
Even if the new one is more delicate,

560
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,000
I would always miss the old one.

561
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,240
Mu Ze seems so familiar to me.

562
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,440
When he stood before me
in the army uniform

563
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,160
that I'm especially familiar with,

564
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,560
it's as if I could see the shadow

565
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,000
of Xiao Jun's dad.

566
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,580
Therefore,

567
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,000
I trust him.

568
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,820
I even relied heavily on him once.

569
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,470
However, I know that

570
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,360
I can't bring my feelings forward.

571
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,690
He won't do that.

572
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,670
I won't do that either.

573
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,780
There are many patterns I can do.

574
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,510
However, there is only one blue bird.

575
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,600
I get it.

576
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,770
I can totally understand that.

577
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,300
Stop thinking so much.

578
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,030
Xiao Jun will slowly grow up.

579
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,810
He won't let you live a lonely life.

580
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

581
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,530
See you.

582
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,110
Goodbye.

583
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,540
Xia Chu.

584
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,810
Have some water.

585
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,320
Listen.

586
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,840
I shouldn't have had scolded you.

588
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,460
However, bringing you back to the camp

589
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,530
is for your own good.

590
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,720
Am I right?

591
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,780
Someone will take care of your meals.

592
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,030
You'll recover faster.

593
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,710
Just stay here with ease.

594
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,940
I'll always be in the camp.

595
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,990
You can reach me anytime

596
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,470
for anything.

597
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,570
Okay?

598
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,290
Xia Chu.

599
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,380
I'm hungry.

600
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,060
No problem.

601
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,760
Reporting!

602
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,270
Come in.

603
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,980
Captain Liang.

604
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,000
Why do you look troubled?

605
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,670
Look at the operational requirement
suggested by the sixth team.

606
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,850
How can I not be troubled?

607
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,990
I'm not talking about
operational requirement.

608
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,110
I'm talking about Dr Xia.

609
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,230
She's a lady after all.

610
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,620
She's staying at the guest house alone.

611
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,930
Do you think it's appropriate?

612
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,380
Dr Xia is a doctor.

613
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,180
She knows how to take care of herself.

614
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,350
Why are you doing this to her?

615
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,080
You're used to staying with her.

616
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,680
-Lieutenant Tian.
-Yes!

617
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,920
I think our platoon

618
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,000
is lacking vigour lately.

619
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,340
Is it?

620
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,950
I was receiving training elsewhere.

621
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,150
As the vice captain,

622
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,110
aren't you supposed to lead by example

623
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,430
and make sure everyone in the platoon

624
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,350
including yourself
to be disciplined in physical training?

625
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,840
Look at your
physical fitness test results.

626
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,910
What happened to you?

627
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,020
However, the overall performance
of our platoon has improved.

628
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,160
Xiao Teng won the second runner-up

629
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,390
in 800m obstacle race.

630
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,580
-Is that good enough?
-No.

631
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,200
-Is that good enough?
-No!

632
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,720
From tomorrow onward,
train yourself to death.

633
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,810
Make sure you get number one
in the next assessment.

634
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,260
-Do you hear me?
-Yes!

635
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,540
Leave.

636
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,790
Yes.

637
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,990
♫ Standing upright and neatly lined up

638
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,450

♫ We know we have great responsibilities

♫ Can be achieved by you and me ♫

659
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,320
He's showing off.

660
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,660
So?

661
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,740
Have you gotten any the idea
for the coming shoot?

662
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,590
Let me know if you have any ideas.

663
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,650
Boss, why don't we film
about internet entrepreneurship?

664
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,310
How about acting agencies?

665
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,980
Why don't we go for food column?

666
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,670
Mi Gu!

667
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,440
Are you okay?

668
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,850
What do you think?

669
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,139
I didn't mean it.

670
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,690
Something went wrong with your guest.

671
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,530
Not only did you not solve the issue,

672
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,159
you dozed off during the meeting.

673
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,560
Do you still want the job?

674
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,270
Boss.

675
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,280
I've completed the new proposal.

676
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,790
Please take a look.

677
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,639
Filming a doctor's daily life?

678
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,040
Filming a doctor's daily life

679
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,389
to present the doctor-patient relationship
which is a public concern.

680
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,280
We can also make the show stands out

681
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,600
by including all kinds
of eye catching rare diseases.

682
00:34:58,739 --> 00:34:59,739
At the same time, we can instil

683
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,840
the correct values on health and death
in the public.

684
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,680
Not only is it evergreen,
it's also interesting to watch.

685
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,560
More importantly,
I have a good subject to feature.

686
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,040
What do you think?

687
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,760
Do you think it's doable?

688
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,250
Yes.

689
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,820
Lad.

690
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,720
Your mum is exhausted

691
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,120
from taking care of you.

692
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,490
Now that you're discharged,

693
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,440
you must listen to your mum.

694
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,420
Got it?

695
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,330
Yes.

696
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,760
All right, Dr Zhang.

697
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,080
You don't have to send us off.

698
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,960
Send me a message
after you've reached home.

699
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,290
Sure.

700
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,000
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Dr Zhang.

701
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,000
Goodbye.

702
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,970
Goodbye.

703
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,230
Let's go.

704
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,990
Dr Zhang, you're indeed

705
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,550
not picky at all.

706
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,170
My patient is discharged today.

707
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,840
Am I not allowed to send him off?

708
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,640
Why didn't you come that weekend?

709
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,840
You went there?

710
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,810
Of course.

711
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,370
I waited for you for the whole night.

712
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,480
No way.

713
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm serious. Why would I lie?

714
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,830
I know you well.

715
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,230
Li Juan.

716
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,430
You...

717
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,610
You're anything but stubborn.

718
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,170
Even if you waited at the pub
for the whole night,

719
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,330
you're not just waiting for me, right?

720
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,400
We had a date.

721
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,350
Who else would I wait for
if it weren't for you?

722
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,280
Are you crazy?

723
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,750
Are you free tonight? Let's go together.

724
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,260
I'm sorry.

725
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,340
I already have a date.

726
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,680
Sure, can't wait to eat it.

727
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,900
See you tonight.

728
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,280
See?

729
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,530
I have everything in the world.

730
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,720
I took care of the surveillance system.

731
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,670
I'm ready.

732
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,540
Do you really want to do that?

733
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,030
<i>"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders"
by Soji Shimada</i>

734
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,530
<i>Listen.</i>

735
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,750
I have a bad hunch.

736
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,550
You'd better be fast.

737
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,640
Are you done?

738
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,120
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

739
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,390
<i>Will you answer me?</i>

740
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
Can you hear me, Zhuo Ran?

741
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,640
Can you hear me?

742
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,800
Can you hear me?

743
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,340
Are you Xia Chu's pet?

744
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,800
What is your name?

745
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,830
Don't touch me.

746
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,760
I didn't know that you had a cat.

747
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,820
Can you hear me? Yang Mu Ze is back.

748
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,150
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?
Liang Mu Ze...

749
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,460
Liang Mu Ze is back!

750
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,710
Can you hear me? Liang Mu Ze is back!

751
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:29,980
What's wrong?

752
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,080
Help!

753
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,640
A bad guy wanted to hurt me.

754
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,640
A bad guy is after me!

755
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,340
Are you missing your owner?

756
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,030
She'll be back soon.

757
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,870
That's enough. Go watch the door.

758
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,470
I don't care if she's coming back soon.

759
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,990
I want you to take me away from here.

760
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,600
Can we rewind to the earlier time?

761
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:38,800
Usually it works that way.

762
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,960
However, something is wrong

763
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,030
with the surveillance system.

764
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,790
There is no video signal.

765
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,370
No signal?

766
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,300
Yes.

767
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,160
We just got it repaired.

768
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,800
Hence,
the earlier recording is not available.

769
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,820
Sorry about that.

770
00:44:49,814 --> 00:45:19,814
