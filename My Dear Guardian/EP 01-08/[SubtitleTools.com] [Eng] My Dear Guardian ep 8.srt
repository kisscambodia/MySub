00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,190
<i>Episode 8</i>

4
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,880
Xiao Jun.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you still like

6
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,310
Xuan Xuan from your school?

7
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,160
What do you like about her?

8
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,709
I like everything about her.

9
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,320
Why?

10
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,200
Is she the prettiest girl

11
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,640
in your school?

12
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,550
I don't think so.

13
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,920
Then why do you like her?

14
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,429
Why did you suddenly ask me this?

15
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,960
Luo Xiao Jun.

16
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,000
How do you feel?

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,440
What say you?

18
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,040
I think you're doing really well.

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,200
Xia Chu.

20
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,120
Change his dressing.

21
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,090
Yes.

22
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,750
What are you doing?

23
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,560
We're discussing about the next step.

24
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,320
You're really in the mood.

25
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,990
All right. Let's go to Room 3.

26
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,880
Is it so difficult to see a doctor?

27
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:55,710
Let's go.

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,240
Let's go. It's time
to see the psychiatrist.

29
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,160
Don't mess with me.

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,150
I'm not messing with you.

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,760
-It's your turn.
-It's my turn.

32
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,690
Liang Mu Ze.

33
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,840
The  white blood cell count
of patient no. 18 is still low.

34
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,790
Pay attention to him.

35
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,770
If your family like it,

36
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,540
just let me know.

37
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,920
I can bring more for you.

38
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,070
Don't be shy.

39
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,680
What are you doing?

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,740
Dr Zhang.

41
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,720
Don't sell it too hard.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,380
You're going to make our nurses

43
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,690
go bankrupt soon.

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,120
That's impossible.
These handmade reusable bag

45
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,800
are designed by me.

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,990
-It's a present for the nurses.
-Is it?

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,710
It's to thank them
for taking care of my son.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,230
Thank you so much.

49
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,440
We're getting back to work.

50
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,950
Thank you for the present.

51
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,880
You should get back to work. By the way,

52
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,210
-it's for everyone.
-Thank you, Ms Meng Zhen.

53
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,420
The patterns and designs
are my ideas.

54
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,540
You won't find it anywhere else.

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,820
I hope you like it.

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,010
Thank you.

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,200
You're welcome.

58
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,560
I don't get one?

59
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,050
It's rare to see men buying reusable bag.

60
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,730
Hence, I didn't make one for you.

61
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,880
However,

62
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,180
I know that doctors are hygienic.

63
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,090
Therefore,

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,070
I made you a soap.

65
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,240
I hope you like it.

66
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,640
You made a soap for me?

67
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,400
Look,

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,950
my surname is carved on the soap.

69
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:27,490
Thank you so much.

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
You're welcome.

71
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,440
It's personally customised
and it's the only and only in the world.

72
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,670
I'll keep it well.

73
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,550
Sure.

74
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,800
By the way, we just checked on Xiao Jun.

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,950
He's recovering well.

76
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,560
We changed his dressing today.

77
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
If everything goes well,

78
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,840
he can be discharged on Monday.

79
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,880
Really?

80
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,820
Thank you so much!

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,840
Okay, got it.

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,359
I'll come now.

83
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,920
There's a patient in the emergency ward.

84
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,430
A metal pierced through his chest.

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm going down to have a look.

86
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:58,930
Take care of your respective patients.

87
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,230
-Call me if anything.
-Yes.

88
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,540
Okay, you go ahead.

89
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,370
Ms Meng Zhen, we're getting back to work.

90
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,750
Okay, go now.

91
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,470
Have you fallen in love with someone?

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,440
No.

93
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,660
Say it.

94
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,710
It's a secret between us.

95
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,360
I won't tell Ms Zhen.

96
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,020
I'm not you. I'm not scared of your mum.

97
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,080
Who are you scared of?

98
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm scared of you the most.

99
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,980
Xiao Jun.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,710
It's time to change dressing.

101
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,850
Here.

102
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,260
Pull your shirt up.

103
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,930
Let me help you.

104
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,060
Go away!

105
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,470
Don't touch me. Get out now!

106
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,920
I'll leave after changing the dressing.

107
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,960
Here, be good.

108
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,100
I don't want you to do it.

109
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,460
I don't want you to do it.

110
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,960
Get out!

111
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,600
Get out!

112
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,410
Xiao Jun.

113
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,580
Xiao Jun, what's wrong?

114
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,840
Dr Xia, what's going on?

115
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,390
Nothing.

116
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,950
Dr Xia, you need to learn

117
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,810
how to respect your patient.

118
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,720
What if the patient is wrong?

119
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,400
If he stays stubborn,

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,240
he will bear greater pain in the end.

121
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,880
Dr Xia, it's just changing the dressing.

122
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,000
Why would he suffer from greater pain?

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
Nothing.

124
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,840
I'll come again later.

125
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,170
Sure.

126
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,910
<i>Why hasn't medical order
for patient no. 17 here yet?</i>

127
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,870
<i>You're the slowest. Speed up.</i>

128
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,160
No...

129
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,820
My desktop went dead just now.

130
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,040
I just got it repaired.

131
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>Explain to the patient!</i>

132
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,440
Can you please change dressing
for Luo Xiao Jun on behalf of me?

133
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,160
No, I'm occupied.

134
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll prepare the medical order for you.

135
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,450
You can leave all the medical orders
that has to be done within this week

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,520
to me.

137
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,120
Two weeks worth of medical orders.

138
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,580
It's a deal.

139
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,320
It's done.

140
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,040
-Thank you, Dr Xiao.
-No problem.

141
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,910
Thank you.

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,550
By the way, Xiao Jun,

143
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,720
tell me the truth.

144
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,310
Why won't you let Dr Xia
to change your dressing?

145
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,920
It's none of your business.

146
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,560
It's none of your business too.

147
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,400
Luo Xiao Jun!

148
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
What's wrong with you?

149
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,050
You're being rude.

150
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,240
Liang Mu Ze.

151
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,359
Will you take care of Ms Zhen forever?

152
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,320
It's none of your business.

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,530
Xiao Jun.

154
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,240
You haven't told me

155
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,680
what you want for lunch.

156
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,510
Will you, Liang Mu Ze?

157
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,120
Of course. Do you have to ask?

158
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,720
I want braised pork ribs.
Two portions please.

159
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,800
Ms Zhen, go with Liang Mu Ze.

160
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,520
Why are you so happy?

161
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,680
Liang Mu Ze promised
to take care of Ms Zhen forever.

162
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,740
What does that mean?

163
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,760
That means I took note of it.

164
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,560
I know why you hate me.

165
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,440
It's because of Liang Mu Ze, right?

166
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,240
Listen.

167
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,880
Ever since we met each other
for the first time,

168
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,600
I've always been your doctor.

169
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,239
Now, I'm still your doctor.

170
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,030
I'll be responsible of your health

171
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,759
until you're discharged.

172
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,759
Please don't hate me.

173
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,629
It's nothing to do with Liang Mu Ze.

174
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,119
It's for your own good.

175
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,590
If

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,760
you hold grudges against me for nothing,

177
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,960
you may hurt yourself in the end.

178
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,050
Please buy me a bouquet of flowers.

179
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,310
What?

180
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,140
In the name of Liang Mu Ze.

181
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,560
Send a bouquet of flowers to my mum.

182
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,160
That way, I'll believe in you.

183
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,440
Will you behave and receive treatment?

184
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,410
Yes.

185
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,270
That's a deal.

186
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,560
That's a deal.

187
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,720
-Are you going back to the camp later?
-Yes.

188
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,840
Xiao Jun becomes more sensitive
after falling sick.

189
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,170
Don't take what he said just now

190
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,440
to heart.

191
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,470
Meng Zhen.

192
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,200
Xiao Jun is a kid but I'm not.

193
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll honour my words.

194
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,720
You don't have to do that, Mu Ze.

195
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,200
It's been eight years.
It's more than enough.

196
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,580
I can take care of myself.

197
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,160
Xiao Jun has grown up.

198
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,880
I can take care of him by myself.

199
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,360
As for you,

200
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,080
you should move on.

201
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,880
You should go on with dating,
getting married

202
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,880
and have your own children.

203
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,190
You should find your own life purpose.

204
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,010
Taking care of you is my life purpose.

205
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,900
Do you plan to live like this
for the rest of your life?

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,550
Both of us know that
it shouldn't be like this.

207
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,180
Sometimes,

208
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,750
inappropriate promises
could be a form of disturbance

209
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,800
to a kid.

210
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,230
Mum.

211
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,640
Xiao Jun.

212
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,180
Xiao Jun, why are you here?

213
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,840
Didn't I tell you to wait in the ward?

214
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,310
It's for you.

215
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,390
Where did you get the flowers?

216
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,080
Liang Mu Ze got it in secret.

217
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,600
He wants to give you a surprise. Look.

218
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,950
It's a card with his name on it.

219
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,160
Hurry up, Liang Mu Ze.

220
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,820
Aren't you going to propose?

221
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,350
The flowers are so beautiful.

222
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,520
I like it.

223
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,310
I like it no matter who the sender is.

224
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,840
However...

225
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,800
We can't get married.

226
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,670
Why?

227
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,640
You promised
you will take care of her forever.

228
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,400
I'll take care of both of you forever.

229
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,160
However,
it's different from getting married.

230
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,360
Why?

231
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,560
Is it because you don't like my mum?

232
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,260
Here, come here.

233
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,250
Listen.

234
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,360
Come here.

235
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,430
Sit down.

236
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,190
Let me tell you.

237
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,870
Marriage is something important.

238
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,430
It's not as simple as you imagine.

239
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,990
It's not just about liking someone or not.

240
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,070
There are more elements to it.

241
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,440
Therefore,

242
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,650
I can't marry Liang Mu Ze.

243
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,550
It's not going to happen.

244
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,880
Can you understand?

245
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,830
He promised to take care of you forever.

246
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,670
He said that out of kindness.

247
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,480
However, taking care of us
is not his responsibility.

248
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,390
It's a success!

249
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,920
Stop crying, Xiao Jun.

250
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,680
Stop crying.

251
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,980
Xiao Jun.

252
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,140
What's wrong?

253
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,890
What's wrong?

254
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,360
Was it you?

255
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,120
Yes.

256
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,120
Are you crazy?

257
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,720
Ridiculous.

258
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,980
Yes.

259
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm crazy.

260
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,320
Dr Xia.

261
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,320
You should apologise to her.

262
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,720
Dr Xia.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,750
Dr Xia, sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.

264
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,580
It's okay. I'm going to meet a friend
at the emergency department.

265
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,680
Be careful!

266
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,220
Dr Xia, are you okay?

267
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,360
Put up with it.

268
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,480
Your bone is fine

269
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,880
but the ligament is injured.

270
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,960
If it's not fixed,

271
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,480
it won't recover.

272
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,330
You're a doctor.

273
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,720
You should know the consequences.

274
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,260
How long will it take to recover?

275
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,670
It will take about a week.

276
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,710
Don't walk too much and rest well.

277
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,080
Can I go to work tomorrow?

278
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
Go to work?

279
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,680
Do you plan to give up
on conducting surgery?

280
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,260
We'll talk about it
when your leg has fully recovered.

281
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,600
You may get back to work.

282
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,180
I can handle it.

283
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,140
I'm going back to the unit at 6 o'clock.

284
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,370
You should come back with me.

285
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,730
Why?

286
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,760
You'll be staying there for a few days.

287
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,830
Why?

288
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,280
Why? He's worried about you.

289
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,780
No.

290
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,040
I promised Zhang Yi Chi

291
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,700
to take good care of you.

292
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,010
It's done.

293
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,270
Go get a wheelchair.

294
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,300
It's not needed.

295
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,680
Liang Mu Ze!

296
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,430
Military officers have great stamina.

297
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,280
Liang Mu Ze, let me down!

298
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,500
Put me down!

299
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,300
Stop moving.

300
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,520
I won't be responsible if you fall.

301
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,730
Put me down!

302
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,460
We're in the hospital.

303
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,080
You're creating a scene.

304
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,280
Stop looking around.

305
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,470
-Look at them.
-You...

306
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,940
Let me down!

307
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,860
Stop moving.

308
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,270
I...

309
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,100
Let go of me! I want to get down!

310
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,950
You're abducting me.

311
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,040
I'm going to scream for help.

312
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,310
If you don't mind embarrassing yourself,
you may do so.

313
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,280
I don't mind.

314
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,370
Should we follow them?

315
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,000
Go back to the office.

316
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,790
Mi Gu?

317
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,760
Mi Gu!

318
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,740
Mi Gu!

319
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,120
Mi Gu!

320
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,900
I'll be there in half an hour.

321
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,640
Roll down the car window.

322
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,670
Mi Gu!

323
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,360
Mi Gu!

324
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,320
He's gone?

325
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,090
Yes.

326
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,980
He requested to be discharged.

327
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,160
Didn't you know?

328
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,840
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

329
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,230
One, two, three, four!

330
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,820
One, two, three, four!

331
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,580
One, two, three, four!

332
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,560
One, two, three, four!

333
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,320
I think I just saw Captain Liang's car.

334
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,990
Stand still!

335
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,400
Tian Yong.

336
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,620
Tian Yong.

337
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,090
Captain.

338
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,510
Dr Xia?

339
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,290
Yes.

340
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,680
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

341
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,950
Good day, Mrs Liang.

342
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,340
Good day, Mrs Liang.

343
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,440
Good day, Mrs Liang.

344
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,730
Good day, Mrs Liang!

345
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,860
Good day, Mrs Liang.

346
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,120
Good day, Mrs Liang.

347
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,769
What are you doing?

348
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,390
Who is Mrs Liang?

349
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,350
Brigade Commander.

350
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,350
Good day, Brigade Commander!

351
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,680
I told you to come back at 6 o'clock.

352
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,559
You're late 20 minutes.

353
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,539
What happened?

354
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,549
Reporting.

355
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,549
Chief.

356
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,450
Chief.

357
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,440
He was late because
he kept me company at the hospital.

358
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,680
Who are you?

359
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
Reporting to Brigade Commander.

360
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,360
She is a cardiac surgeon
from 109 Hospital.

361
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,450
Reporting.

362
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,830
Dr Xia was my saviour.

363
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,850
She saved me

364
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,120
when we were in Isaia.

365
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,880
It's you, Dr Xia.

366
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,650
Hello.

367
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,260
I have been wanting
to thank you face to face.

368
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,160
I didn't expect to see you today.

369
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,780
Chief, don't mention it.

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You may call me Xia Chu.

371
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,400
Sure, Xia Chu.

372
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,320
What happened?

373
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,320
I accidentally fell down.

374
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,970
Captain Liang ran into me
in the hospital and hence,

375
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,440
he took me in.

376
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,140
Took you...

377
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Look at me.

378
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,910
I got it now.

379
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,790
Xia Chu.

380
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,560
You're going to stay here
for a while, right?

381
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,070
-Yes.
-No.

382
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,700
She'll stay.

383
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,480
Chief.

384
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,240
The military camp
is full of confidential information.

385
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,480
I'm an outsider.

386
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,430
You're not an outsider.

387
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,390
Xia Chu.

388
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,760
You're Tian Yong's saviour, right?

389
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,200
That means you're the saviour
of Special Forces Brigade too.

390
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,820
Am I right?

391
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,090
Yes!

392
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,650
-Liang Mu Ze.
-Yes!

393
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,070
-Take care of Xia Chu.
-Yes!

394
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,460
Chief.

395
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,920
I need to get back to the hospital.
I didn't apply for leave.

396
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,760
You don't have to worry about that.

397
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,480
Just stay here, relax

398
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,610
and nurse your wound.

399
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,600
I'll talk to your boss later.

400
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

401
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,880
Send Xia Chu to the guest house.

402
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,680
Yes!

403
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,560
-I'll send her there now.
-Go.

404
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,310
-Thank you, Chief.
-Goodbye, Xia Chu.

405
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,040
I'm leaving, Brigade Commander.

406
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,840
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

407
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,360
I've a meeting
at the Brigade Headquarters.

408
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,570
So, please send dinner
and daily necessities

409
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,880
to Dr Xia.

410
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,360
Get her a few pair of clothes too.

411
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,400
Will do, sir.

412
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,240
-Tian Yong!
-Yes!

413
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,280
Sing the cadence while marching.

414
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,720
Yes!

415
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,680
Turn to the rear and march!

416
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,880
♫ Unity is strength ♫

417
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,320
Ready, sing!

418
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,200
♫ Unity is strength ♫

419
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,760
Liang Mu Ze, I don't want to stay here!

420
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,540
You're not going to stay here.

421
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,870
I want to go home.

422
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,190
You'd better not do that.

423
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,400
Why?

424
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,250
Because I took you in.

425
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,480
I was giving you face.

426
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,400
I said that because he's your boss.

427
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,170
In fact, I'm kidnapped by you.

428
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,280
Don't act innocent.

429
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,280
Fine, no matter what,

430
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,640
you can only leave after you've recovered.

431
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,990
Liang Mu Ze.

432
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,450
Are you worried

433
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,360
it'd be difficult to explain
to Mr Zhang Yi Chi?

434
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,170
It's okay.

435
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,690
You don't have to take it to heart.

436
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,120
I can explain for you.

437
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,250
Just let me go, okay?

438
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,120
Let me survive on my own, okay?

439
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,580
What does that mean?

440
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,440
Just how much do you loathe

441
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,800
military camp and Special Forces soldiers?

442
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,590
No matter how much you loathe us,

443
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,550
you have to put up with us.

444
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,730
It's nothing to do with military camp
and the Special Forces!

445
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,880
I just want to stay alone!

446
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,160
I just want to go home!

447
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,620
I don't want to stand in your way

448
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,220
and being called crazy.
Can't you just let me go?

449
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,420
No.

450
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,370
Why?

451
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,220
That's my house.

452
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,400
I have the final say on
whether you can go back.

453
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,560
Attention! At ease.

454
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,450
Xia Chu.

455
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,120
Stop crying.

456
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,790
Xia Chu.

457
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,690
Stop crying.

458
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,250
Stop crying.

459
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,430
Xia Chu.

460
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,430
Is the medicine not working?

461
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,440
<i>Yes, she's been crying.</i>

462
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,590
Where are you?

463
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,960
I'll check on her.

464
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,160
We're in the military camp.

465
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,720
Are you sure that her bone is fine?

466
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,760
Don't worry.

467
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,080
The diagnosis by Orthopaedic Department

468
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,680
is surely accurate.

469
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,110
<i>Furthermore, even if she injured
her bone,</i>

470
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,540
a minor outpatient treatment
wouldn't make her cry.

471
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,670
Be honest.

472
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,350
Did you bully her?

473
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,520
How is Xiao Jun doing?

474
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,890
<i>I've just done with my work.</i>

475
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm going to check on him.

476
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,380
<i>All right, give me a call if anything.</i>

477
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,670
You should take care of yourself.

478
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,210
<i>Since you brought her back,</i>

479
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,510
<i>you should take care of her.</i>

480
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,090
<i>When you're dealing with a lady,</i>

481
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,480
you have to be gentle, okay?

482
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,080
She's injured

483
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,120
but her parents are not around.

484
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,370
<i>She must be fragile at the moment.</i>

485
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,170
<i>She can't take your cold treatment.</i>

486
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,720
All right, I've to go.

487
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,350
He brought her back.

488

490

Have some food.

491
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,590
Is it sweet?

492
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,440
Did I scare Liang Mu Ze away?

493
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,630
He's not made of paper.

494
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,120
He's gone back to the military camp.

495
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,500
No.

496
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,040
I almost died

497
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,010
from the illness.

498
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,340
I had two surgeries.

499
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,550
My heart is problematic.

500
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,320
You're all right.

501
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,280
You've recovered, okay?

502
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,160
Nothing will happen to you.

503
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,920
No one can predict the future.

504
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,460
If one day

505
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,190
I leave this world just like dad,

506
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,040
I hope

507
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,900
someone can keep you company

508
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,130
and take care of you.

509
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,920
Otherwise, you'll be lonely.

510
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,760
You'll be sad for sure.

511
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,770
That's why I lied to you

512
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,440
and claimed that the flower
was from Liang Mu Ze.

513
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,730
I like him.

514
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,160
I thought you liked him too.

515
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,990
I didn't lie on purpose.

516
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,070
I know.

517
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,260
You will be fine.

518
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,320
You will be fine.

519
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,920
You'll always be by my side.

520
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,100
Don't think too much, okay?

521
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,700
I know.

522
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,590
You will be fine.

523
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,880
Are you doing laundry?

524
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,560
Dr Zhang.

525
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,820
Done with work?

526
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,210
What's wrong?

527
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,080
Nothing.

528
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,790
The laundry detergent
accidentally got into my eyes.

529
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,980
That's a little far-fetched.

530
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,200
Did you cry?

531
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,880
Xiao Jun bought me a bouquet of flower

532
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,200
in the afternoon.

533
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,160
He told Liang Mu Ze to propose to me.

534
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,750
Propose to you?

535
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,560
Were you touched?

536
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,800
It's never crossed my mind that

537
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,720
my son would be the match-maker for me.

538
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,890
He said,

539
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,680
he's worried that if he left the world,

540
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,880
I would be lonely.

541
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,500
Actually that's a good idea.

542
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,160
Liang Mu Ze is a nice man.

543
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,040
I think you should consider him.

544
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,870
What? Liang Mu Ze?

545
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes.

546
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,480
How is that possible?

547
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,310
Listen.

548
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,360
I embroidered a piece of table cloth
a few years back.

549
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,190
It's a blue bird.

550
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,070
I really liked it.

551
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,110
However, one day,
I accidentally spilled juice on it.

552
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,120
It's tainted.

553
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,950
I couldn't get rid of the stain
no matter how hard I tried.

554
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,230
I thought

555
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,080
I could produce another one

556
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,870
but I couldn't do it.

557
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,340
When the patterns are similar,

558
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,660
I can't help but keep comparing the both.

559
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,040
Even if the new one is more delicate,

560
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,200
I would always miss the old one.

561
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,440
Mu Ze seems so familiar to me.

562
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
When he stood before me
in the army uniform

563
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,360
that I'm especially familiar with,

564
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,760
it's as if I could see the shadow

565
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,200
of Xiao Jun's dad.

566
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,780
Therefore,

567
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,200
I trust him.

568
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,020
I even relied heavily on him once.

569
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,670
However, I know that

570
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,560
I can't bring my feelings forward.

571
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,890
He won't do that.

572
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,870
I won't do that either.

573
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,980
There are many patterns I can do.

574
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,710
However, there is only one blue bird.

575
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,800
I get it.

576
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,970
I can totally understand that.

577
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,500
Stop thinking so much.

578
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,230
Xiao Jun will slowly grow up.

579
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,010
He won't let you live a lonely life.

580
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,800
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

581
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,730
See you.

582
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,310
Goodbye.

583
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,740
Xia Chu.

584
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,010
Have some water.

585
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,520
Listen.

586
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,670
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,040
I shouldn't have had scolded you.

588
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,660
However, bringing you back to the camp

589
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,730
is for your own good.

590
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,920
Am I right?

591
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,980
Someone will take care of your meals.

592
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,230
You'll recover faster.

593
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,910
Just stay here with ease.

594
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,140
I'll always be in the camp.

595
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,190
You can reach me anytime

596
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,670
for anything.

597
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,770
Okay?

598
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,490
Xia Chu.

599
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,580
I'm hungry.

600
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,260
No problem.

601
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,960
Reporting!

602
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,470
Come in.

603
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,180
Captain Liang.

604
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,200
Why do you look troubled?

605
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,870
Look at the operational requirement
suggested by the sixth team.

606
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,050
How can I not be troubled?

607
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,190
I'm not talking about
operational requirement.

608
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,310
I'm talking about Dr Xia.

609
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,430
She's a lady after all.

610
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,820
She's staying at the guest house alone.

611
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,130
Do you think it's appropriate?

612
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,580
Dr Xia is a doctor.

613
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,380
She knows how to take care of herself.

614
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,550
Why are you doing this to her?

615
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,280
You're used to staying with her.

616
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,880
-Lieutenant Tian.
-Yes!

617
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,120
I think our platoon

618
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,200
is lacking vigour lately.

619
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,540
Is it?

620
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,150
I was receiving training elsewhere.

621
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,350
As the vice captain,

622
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,310
aren't you supposed to lead by example

623
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,630
and make sure everyone in the platoon

624
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,550
including yourself
to be disciplined in physical training?

625
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
Look at your
physical fitness test results.

626
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,110
What happened to you?

627
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,220
However, the overall performance
of our platoon has improved.

628
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,360
Xiao Teng won the second runner-up

629
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,590
in 800m obstacle race.

630
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,780
-Is that good enough?
-No.

631
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,400
-Is that good enough?
-No!

632
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,920
From tomorrow onward,
train yourself to death.

633
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,010
Make sure you get number one
in the next assessment.

634
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,460
-Do you hear me?
-Yes!

635
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,740
Leave.

636
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,990
Yes.

637
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,190
♫ Standing upright and neatly lined up

638
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,650

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,730
♫ Trekking through forests
and over mountains ♫

♫ Our passion burns the thorns down ♫

645
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,530
♫ We've always been naughty brats ♫

646

♫ We know we have great responsibilities

647
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,520
♫ Endless, dull repetitions ♫

648
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,590
♫ It's to make sure we don't hesitate

♫ Can be achieved by you and me ♫

659
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,520
He's showing off.

660
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,860
So?

661
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,940
Have you gotten any the idea
for the coming shoot?

662
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,790
Let me know if you have any ideas.

663
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,850
Boss, why don't we film
about internet entrepreneurship?

664
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,510
How about acting agencies?

665
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,180
Why don't we go for food column?

666
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,870
Mi Gu!

667
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,640
Are you okay?

668
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,050
What do you think?

669
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,339
I didn't mean it.

670
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,890
Something went wrong with your guest.

671
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,730
Not only did you not solve the issue,

672
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,359
you dozed off during the meeting.

673
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,760
Do you still want the job?

674
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,470
Boss.

675
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,480
I've completed the new proposal.

676
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,990
Please take a look.

677
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,839
Filming a doctor's daily life?

678
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,240
Filming a doctor's daily life

679
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,589
to present the doctor-patient relationship
which is a public concern.

680
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,480
We can also make the show stands out

681
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,800
by including all kinds
of eye catching rare diseases.

682
00:34:58,939 --> 00:34:59,939
At the same time, we can instil

683
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,040
the correct values on health and death
in the public.

684
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,880
Not only is it evergreen,
it's also interesting to watch.

685
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,760
More importantly,
I have a good subject to feature.

686
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,240
What do you think?

687
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,960
Do you think it's doable?

688
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,450
Yes.

689
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,020
Lad.

690
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,920
Your mum is exhausted

691
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,320
from taking care of you.

692
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,690
Now that you're discharged,

693
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,640
you must listen to your mum.

694
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,620
Got it?

695
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,530
Yes.

696
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,960
All right, Dr Zhang.

697
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,280
You don't have to send us off.

698
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,160
Send me a message
after you've reached home.

699
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,490
Sure.

700
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,200
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Dr Zhang.

701
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,200
Goodbye.

702
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,170
Goodbye.

703
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,430
Let's go.

704
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,190
Dr Zhang, you're indeed

705
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,750
not picky at all.

706
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,370
My patient is discharged today.

707
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,040
Am I not allowed to send him off?

708
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,840
Why didn't you come that weekend?

709
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,040
You went there?

710
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,010
Of course.

711
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,570
I waited for you for the whole night.

712
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,680
No way.

713
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,440
I'm serious. Why would I lie?

714
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,030
I know you well.

715
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,430
Li Juan.

716
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,630
You...

717
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,810
You're anything but stubborn.

718
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,370
Even if you waited at the pub
for the whole night,

719
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,530
you're not just waiting for me, right?

720
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,600
We had a date.

721
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,550
Who else would I wait for
if it weren't for you?

722
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,480
Are you crazy?

723
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,950
Are you free tonight? Let's go together.

724
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,460
I'm sorry.

725
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,540
I already have a date.

726
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,880
Sure, can't wait to eat it.

727
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,100
See you tonight.

728
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,480
See?

729
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,730
I have everything in the world.

730
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,920
I took care of the surveillance system.

731
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,870
I'm ready.

732
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,740
Do you really want to do that?

733
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,230
<i>"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders"
by Soji Shimada</i>

734
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,730
<i>Listen.</i>

735
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,950
I have a bad hunch.

736
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,750
You'd better be fast.

737
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,840
Are you done?

738
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,320
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

739
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,590
<i>Will you answer me?</i>

740
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,920
Can you hear me, Zhuo Ran?

741
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,840
Can you hear me?

742
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,000
Can you hear me?

743
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,540
Are you Xia Chu's pet?

744
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,000
What is your name?

745
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,030
Don't touch me.

746
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,960
I didn't know that you had a cat.

747
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,020
Can you hear me? Yang Mu Ze is back.

748
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,350
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?
Liang Mu Ze...

749
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,660
Liang Mu Ze is back!

750
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,910
Can you hear me? Liang Mu Ze is back!

751
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,180
What's wrong?

752
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,280
Help!

753
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,840
A bad guy wanted to hurt me.

754
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,840
A bad guy is after me!

755
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,540
Are you missing your owner?

756
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,230
She'll be back soon.

757
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,070
That's enough. Go watch the door.

758
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,670
I don't care if she's coming back soon.

759
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,190
I want you to take me away from here.

760
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,800
Can we rewind to the earlier time?

761
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,000
Usually it works that way.

762
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,160
However, something is wrong

763
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,230
with the surveillance system.

764
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,990
There is no video signal.

765
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,570
No signal?

766
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,500
Yes.

767
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,360
We just got it repaired.

768
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,000
Hence,
the earlier recording is not available.

769
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,020
Sorry about that.

00:44:50,014 --> 00:45:20,014
