<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>Episode 2</i>

4
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,270
Do you think I'm short on cash?

5
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:47,860
If you can't afford a moving company,

6
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,900
I can sponsor you.

7
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,020
Don't be afraid to ask.

8
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,870
Look at him being all obnoxious.

9
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,709
That one, two, three, four, too.

10
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,500
He can't wait to see me

11
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,670
fall into despair.

12
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,390
Who gave him that confidence?

13
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,020
How hard is it to get a new place?

14
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,900
I can't believe

15
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,150
that in the entire Ningjiang District,

16
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,910
there's not a place for me.

17
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,480
Where do you usually crash at night?

18
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,380
The whole world belongs to me.

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,950
But I really hate moving.

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,220
I've got to go to work, look for a place,

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,420
then pack up and clean up again.

22
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,750
I'll really go mad.

23
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,190
Calm down.

24
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,270
It's okay. I must remain calm.

25
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,510
As a modern lady,

26
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,580
I won't be defeated

27
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,870
by such a trivial matter.

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,029
Just focus on doing the laundry first.

29
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,190
He says a little pain in life
doesn't matter...

30
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,670
It's just moving to a new place, isn't it?

31
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,670
Anything on tonight?

32
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,040
Where did you come from?
You gave me a scare.

33
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,110
Do you have anything to do tonight?

34
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,590
I'll be looking for new places online

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
so I can move out soon.

36
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,710
I need you to come with me.

37
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,550
I'm not done hanging up my laundry yet.

38
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,710
It's for something more important
than this.

39
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,600
A kid was hurt,

40
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,779
but he refuses to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,750
I need a doctor.

42
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,510
So I'm needed only when something happens?

43
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,630
Isn't it a doctor's duty
to heal the wounded and save the dying?

44
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,390
Let's go.

45
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,230
Is that kid

46
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,790
-very important to you?
-Yes.

47
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,870
What if...

48
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,029
I'll do my best.

49
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,030
Xiao Jun.

50
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,310
Liang Mu Ze.

51
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,310
Alright, let me see it.

52
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,220
Now you're embarrassed?

53
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,750
I just asked you to wash up
but you didn't.

54
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,590
He insisted on waiting for you.

55
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,230
You got hit?

56
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,070
I brought this madam doctor

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,190
to look at your injury.

58
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,870
Madam doctor?

59
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,470
Just call me sister.

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,630
Pretty please, handsome boy?

61
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,950
Let me have a look.

62
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,390
It's too dark in here.
Do you have a torchlight?

63
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,670
Yes. Mu Ze.

64
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,670
On the table over there.

65
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,680
<i>Just give up, Mu Ze.</i>

66
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,070
<i>I know you're almost out.</i>

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
<i>How would you know that?</i>

68
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,790
<i>If you can, so can I.</i>

69
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,710
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

70
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,990
<i>I can't.</i>

71
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,870
-<i>You lost.</i>
-<i>I lost.</i>

72
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,880
<i>I lost.</i>

73
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,110
<i>There's always a bigger fish.</i>

74
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,200
-<i>Let's continue this tomorrow.</i>
-<i>Sure.</i>

75
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,310
<i>I'm always up for that.</i>

76
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,160
<i>Anytime.</i>

77
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,990
<i>Don't move.</i>

78
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,430
<i>Let me try out my new camera.</i>

79
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,790
<i>Go away.</i>

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,350
<i>Three, two, one. Look up.</i>

81
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,910
Mu Ze.

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,590
Now close your eyes.

83
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,750
Don't move. It's going to sting a little.

84
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,470
Hold on. It's almost done.

85
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,400
Hold on just a little bit more.

86
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,510
Xiao Jun is so brave.

87
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,230
Done.

88
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,520
Will there be a scar?

89
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,910
It probably won't.

90
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,990
A scar is nothing.

91
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,860
Am I right?

92
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,990
We're tough men.

93
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,630
Mu Ze, you two have a seat.

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,600
I need to head out for a while.

95
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,030
Where are you going?

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
Look after the kid.

97
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,750
Liang Mu Ze.

98
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,980
Liang Mu Ze, don't leave.

99
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,430
I'm not. I'll just go
to see where she's going.

100
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,510
You promise?

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,830
I promise. Don't worry.

102
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,000
Have some fun with madam doctor.

103
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,110
It's sister.

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,990
How dare he.

105
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,990
What's your relationship
with Liang Mu Ze?

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,340
To be precise, we actually

107
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,670
have just really known each other today.

108
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,100
What about you and him?

109
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,800
We've known each other for many years.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,510
He's my father.

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,000
Where are you going?

112
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm fine.

113
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,150
Please head back first.
Your friend's still there.

114
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,790
I... I'll be back soon.

115
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,990
It doesn't seem like you're fine.

116
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,240
What's the matter?

117
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
I...

118
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,520
Xiao Jun got bullied in class today.

119
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,710
He panicked and banged his head
against the door.

120
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
After that, he fainted.

121
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,790
Although his father is dead,

122
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,150
Xiao Jun has always been very obedient.

123
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,760
I've never hit him.

124
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,270
I went through a lot to raise him.

125
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,750
Who are they to bully him?

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,070
They won't give me an explanation
so I'm getting it myself.

127
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,759
Please don't stop me, Mu Ze.

128
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,080
I don't mean to stop you.

129
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,140
Xiao Jun...

130
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,840
How much longer can you
defend him like that?

131
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:50,070
And you're going with a torchlight?

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,880
What can it do?

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,270
Stop touching it.
There are germs on your hand.

134
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,960
Let it heal on its own.

135
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,120
Why are your lips purplish?

136
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,990
They've always been that way.

137
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,080
Do you usually feel dizzy

138
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,960
or experience chest tightness?

139
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,110
No.

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
No?

141
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,350
Well I... I've done my best.

142
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,360
The dressing isn't really that ugly,
is it?

143
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,910
Does it hurt?

144
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,720
Xiao Jun.

145
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,360
Listen to me.

146
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,710
In future,

147
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,200
if someone tries to bully you...

148
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,390
I was wrong.

149
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,990
Next time, I'll avoid it immediately.

150
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,200
No, it's not your fault.

151
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,670
You can't avoid it.

152
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,750
If someone bullies you,

153
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,310
you retaliate immediately.

154
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,390
You hear that?

155
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,560
You can't bully others,

156
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,110
but you can't let others bully you either.

157
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,230
Got it?

158
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,110
But I'm afraid.

159
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
What are you afraid of?

160
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,920
Your bully feels afraid too.

161
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,150
He only has two fists and two legs
just like you.

162
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,440
As long as you fight back,
he'll be afraid too.

163
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,520
And he won't come at you again.

164
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,710
Got it?

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
Really?

166
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,990
Let me show you a few tricks.

167
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,800
-Okay.
-Come here.

168
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Thanks for talking
to Miss Meng Zhen all night.

169
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
It's fine.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Is Xiao Jun

171
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,520
really your son?

172
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
Yes.

173
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,310
Your personalities are different.

174
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,030
What do you mean?

175
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,710
He really cares for you.

176
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,400
I know.

177
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,600
He'll believe and do

178
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,110
whatever you tell him to.

179
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,480
Is that a problem?

180
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,520
Do you really think the fighting skills
you taught him

181
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,600
will make him untouchable?

182
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,920
I never meant it that way.

183
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,400
Why did you teach him to fight then?

184
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,270
It's called resistance.

185
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,470
When you're bullied,

186
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,320
you won't necessarily win with your fist.

187
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,990
But at least,

188
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,110
it'll make sure

189
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,190
you won't become

190
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
a target of bullies anymore.

191
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,150
Is there really no other tactful way
to resolve this?

192
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,590
Must it be an eye for an eye?

193
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
He will have

194
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,600
to face this world by himself.

195
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,350
Thanks for sending me to the hospital.

196
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,760
Go home and get some sleep.

197
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,150
I don't really need any sleep.

198
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,160
Sleep probably doesn't need you.

199
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Is there a medical explanation for that?

200
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,790
Not that I know of.

201
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,910
But my woman's hunch says,

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,750
the body of a sleepless person

203
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,470
harbours

204
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,400
a battered and weary soul.

205
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,000
Did I get it right, Captain Liang?

206
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,590
Stop being conceited, Dr Xia.

207
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,760
Goodbye.

208
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,920
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

209
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,870
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

210
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,150
You have dark circles under your eyes.

211
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,510
Where did you party last night?

212
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,480
I had a vocational study.

213
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,110
Get changed quickly.

214
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
Dr Zhang will be here soon.

215
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,060
<i>Miss Lan</i>

216
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,270
Miss Lan.

217
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,980
<i>Hey, girl.</i>

218
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,560
How's the place?

219
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,440
<i>I'm getting ready to move.</i>

220
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,910
Why?

221
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,230
I was thinking of...

222
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,830
Hold your thought.

223
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,280
He has a son. Do you know that?

224
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
What?

225
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,380
A son?

226
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,720
What son? I didn't know that.

227
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,400
And yet you were so eager to push

228
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,750
your daughter into relationship hell?

229
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
Are you even my biological mother?

230
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,320
I...

231
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,030
<i>Enough. I won't blame you for it.</i>

232
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,230
I need to work now. Talk again later.

233
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,430
Love you. Mwah!

234
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Goodbye, Miss Lan.

235
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,350
Wait, girl.

236
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,510
A son?

237
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,280
Xiao Xiao, do you have
an extra pair of shoes?

238
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,070
Didn't you keep a pair here?

239
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,150
I forgot.

240
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,200
In that case, I can't help you.

241
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,200
To hell with it then.

242
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,230
A week ago, the patient did

243
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,390
a coronary artery bypass graft.

244
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,990
Since yesterday,

245
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,470
his fluid intake has been 2000 ml,

246
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,030
urine output has been 2100 ml.

247
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,070
Intake and output volumes are balanced.

248
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,430
The drainage tube was removed yesterday.

249
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
She is doing well so far.

250
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,150
You caught a cold?

251
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,910
No.

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,950
I'm just a little sensitive

253
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,160
to the perfume of this doctor.

254
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,160
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,720
My apologies.

256
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,760
You're doing good.

257
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,190
Rest well now.

258
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,040
Why are you back here?

259
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,560
Liang Mu Ze.

260
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,060
This will count as a reward

261
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,410
for treating Xiao Jun yesterday.

262
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,720
Must you draw a line in everything?

263
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,210
Yes.

264
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,570
Fine, whatever you say.

265
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,810
Things like bangles, rings,

266
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,680
brooches and earrings

267
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,090
that interfere with your work

268
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,690
and affect the recovery of patients
must all be discarded.

269
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,930
Keep in mind.

270
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,010
You're either a good or bad doctor,
regardless of gender.

271
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,360
Xia Chu is working
without her military outfit.

272
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,680
Why am I the only one being scolded?

273
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
Xia Chu.

274
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm here.

275
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,370
Why are you so smug?

276
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,210
Why aren't you wearing the military outfit
during working hours?

277
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,570
No.

278
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,090
I'm properly attired. Look.

279
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,040
I'm a professional military doctor.

280
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:50,840
How can I make

281
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,090
a rookie mistake?

282
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
Very good.

283
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,330
Correct mistakes if you've made any,

284
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,490
guard against them if you haven't.

285
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,920
Especially you.

286
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,320
By the way,

287
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
that young officer

288
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,760
who returned from Isaia with us,

289
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,410
how is he doing?

290
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,269
He was already discharged
from ICU yesterday.

291
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,519
According to the order of higher-ups,

292
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,370
he is now placed in the private wad.

293
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,690
Alright.

294
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,799
Let's check on him first.

295
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,760
Yes.

296
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,080
Captain Liang,
are you here to visit the patient?

297
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,120
I was initially here to deliver something.

298
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,970
I came to see Tian Yong since I'm here.

299
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,530
How are you feeling?

300
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,890
Is everything good?

301
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,010
Xia Chu.

302
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:40,800
Yes.

303
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,960
Describe the patient's condition.

304
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,290
Patient's name, Tian Yong.
Age, 32 years old.

305
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,770
Because he was shot
in the left thoracic cavity,

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,240
he was given a thoracotomy

307
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,450
by the Isaia Joint Medical Team.

308
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,960
The bullet was removed.

309
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,160
Two days after the surgery,

310
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,730
he was transferred from Isaia
to our ICU.

311
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,800
After receiving medical treatment,

312
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,090
his condition is good.

313
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,680
Currently,

314
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,930
his blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg,

315
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,010
heartbeat is stable.

316
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,840
Thoracic cavity and pericardium drainage
tube flow is steady.

317
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,840
The rate of drainage in 24 hours

318
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,890
is 100 ml.

319
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,010
What should be done next?

320
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,040
Conduct an echocardiography
and chest CT scan,

321
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,370
a blood routine and a full-set
blood coagulation examination.

322
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,120
Check if the thoracic cavity and
the pericardial drainage

323
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,610
flow rates have reduced

324
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,960
and whether the colour
has gradually turned clearer,

325
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,010
which will decide
if we can remove the tube soon.

326
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,040
In other words,

327
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,890
your recovery is going well.

328
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,970
Dr Zhang.

329
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,770
Will there be any medical repercussions?

330
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,490
Are you experiencing any yourself?

331
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,130
Xia Chu.

332
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,170
Let me introduce.

333
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,320
He

334
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,200
is the officer

335
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,410
I told you about in Isaia

336
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,960
who was injured even worse than Tian Yong.

337
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,160
You must be a major now, aren't you?

338
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,170
Chief, I've heard so much of you.

339
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,290
We know each other.

340
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,650
Really?

341
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,290
Why didn't you mention it?

342
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,250
We don't know each other too well.

343
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,640
We only crossed paths

344
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,890
back in Isaia

345
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,130
when I was held hostage.

346
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,810
Now I remember.

347
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,720
You were the one who saved the hostage,
weren't you?

348
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,520
Since you know each other,

349
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,770
why are you so discreet?

350
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,370
I don't know.

351
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,850
We even met a few times
upon returning.

352
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,050
Is there a cause for it?

353
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,160
No.

354
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,090
If she says so.

355
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,890
Alright then.

356
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,210
In that case,

357
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,490
if there's any problem
with Lieutenant Tian's condition,

358
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,800
you can look for Dr Xia in future.

359
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,770
No problem.

360
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,610
We're done here. Next wad.

361
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,640
What were you doing back there,
Liang Mu Ze?

362
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,610
What do you mean?

363
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,680
Do you know

364
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,930
that what you said just now

365
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,290
will bring me

366
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,360
a lot of troubles?

367
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,930
I only spoke the truth.

368
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,170
Are you a pretty little fool?

369
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,930
If you can't handle gossips,

370
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,970
that is your problem.

371
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,370
Liang Mu Ze.

372
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,890
Liang Mu Ze.

373
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,130
You don't call me chief now, do you?

374
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,810
Listen, Dr Xia.

375
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,890
If you think it is right

376
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,050
to cast people away

377
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,010
after using them,

378
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,810
then continue with it.

379
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,220
I don't care.

380
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,490
But I've told you before.

381
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,050
I like simplicity

382
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,490
and straightforwardness.

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,610
It's not something honourable to know you.

384
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,170
So there's no point in lying about it.

385
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,370
If you like to act,

386
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,610
then suit yourself.

387
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,770
I have no obligation to play along.

388
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,330
Something is not right.

389
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,170
What is it?

390
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,090
Aren't you from the Special Forces?

391
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,970
So?

392
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,610
A person from the Special Forces
shouldn't be

393
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,490
arrogant, cool, inarticulate and tough?

394
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,970
Why is it different when it comes to you?

395
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,980
You're so talkative.

396
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,880
I bet if you were

397
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,480
on a prolonged ambush mission

398
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,770
where you can't speak nor move,

399
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,530
the silence could just kill you.

400
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,600
When you move out,

401
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,570
make sure you take all your stuff.

402
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,330
Captain Liang, join us.

403
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,420
I'm done.

404
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,730
I'm a pretty little fool?

405
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,720
I can't take this.

406
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,810
Has she lost her mind?

407
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,250
What a joke.
How am I a pretty little fool?

408
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,410
She called an officer
a pretty little fool.

409
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,770
Tell me, Tian Yong.

410
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,130
As the top-notch graduate
of military school,

411
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,930
your captain,

412
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,170
in my every aspect,

413
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,210
whether it's my physique,

414
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,530
or my military skills,

415
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,530
or my cognitive aptitudes,

416
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,320
aren't they all equally excellent?

417
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,690
How can she call me a blockhead?

418
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,450
This isn't the worst part.

419
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,930
What really pissed me off is that

420
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,090
she pretended not knowing me

421
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,650
in front of her colleagues.

422
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,380
What's wrong with knowing me?

423
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,730
Tell me what's wrong with that?

424
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,050
Does it embarrass her?

425
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,640
You're just sneering.

426
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,970
Why don't you say something?

427
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,330
Did I feed you too fast?

428
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,020
I'm asking you.

429
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,780
I've answered you.

430
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,010
What did you say?

431
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,610
Via Morse code?

432
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,010
I've been thinking

433
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,250
if we should have

434
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,410
some kind of secret way

435
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,500
of communication between us.

436
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,010
We should, shouldn't we?

437
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,160
If someday you are captured
by the enemy...

438
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,130
Nonsense.

439
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,730
Why isn't it you being captured?

440
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,970
I'm just saying.

441
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,200
You can't do that either.

442
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,940
Let's be clear that there's no way

443
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,850
for it to happen in my troop.

444
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,490
You're being too idealistic.

445
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,010
Major.

446
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,010
Without ideals, why are you
even a soldier?

447
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,730
Without ideals, how can you be a soldier?

448
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,210
Didn't you start off as a soldier
because of your ideals?

449
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,250
I did it for survival.

450
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,610
I grew up in an orphanage

451
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,930
with no parents.

452
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,010
I couldn't find a decent job
after graduating from high school.

453
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,450
What ideals did I have?

454
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,730
I was looking to survive.

455
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,330
Tian Yong.

456
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,860
Listen.

457
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,060
You're wrong.

458
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,140
Even if in the beginning,

459
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,170
you joined the forces
merely because of survival,

460
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,650
you've still managed to stay in it
for so long.

461
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,690
After so many years,

462
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,760
your ideals

463
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,250
have already transcended
the mere reason of surviving.

464
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,960
Am I right?

465
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,140
Don't you deny that.

466
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,660
It's pointless to deny it either.

467
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,210
Look at this.

468
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,740
This here

469
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,730
is the best proof.

470
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,450
What's that?

471
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,400
It was this?

472
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,370
Yes.

473
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,130
Hold on to it.

474
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,690
Keep it, so you'll always remember.

475
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,370
Thanks, captain.

476
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,410
Take it.

477
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,610
That's so kind of you.

478
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,890
Ouch.

479
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,770
It hurts.

480
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,170
That's good.

481
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,580
That way you'll remember.

482
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Brace yourself.

483
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,570
My wound hurts.

484
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,210
Alright. I'll remove it.

485
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,670
<i>Somewhere in Southeast Asia,
Willick, T4 Headquarters</i>

486
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,740
Why did the mission fail?

487
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,730
The local police

488
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,210
hired help from Hunter Military School.

489
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,050
They were all top-notch special forces
from various countries.

490
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,290
What about the thing I wanted?

491
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,250
It's gone.

492
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,260
But we can find another one.

493
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,930
Listen.

494
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm running out of time.

495
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,370
-I must have it as soon...
-Of course.

496
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,300
Just like the steak before us.

497
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,260
As long as one can afford it,

498
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,090
anyone can have a taste of it.

499
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,020
Money is not a problem.

500
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,290
Once I've received it

501
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,090
and confirmed that it's compatible,

502
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,000
you'll have the rest of the payment.

503
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,820
Again, just like this steak,

504
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,570
time determines its doneness.

505
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,170
Likewise,

506
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,620
its taste will vary accordingly too.

507
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,140
What are you trying to say?

508
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,820
The organ provider is from Country A.

509
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,610
This matter has now alerted
not only the Isaia police,

510
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,900
but the Interpol is watching closely too.

511
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,370
Trying to retrieve your goods

512
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,690
under such dire conditions

513
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,170
requires a higher price now,
don't you agree?

514
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,090
You're fooling with me.

515
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,170
Business is business.

516
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,420
Great.

517
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,890
So it is.

518
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,250
Fine.

519
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,450
You may be in power in China,

520
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,100
but over here,

521
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,850
I'm in charge.

522
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,420
Boss, don't move.

523
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,370
You must understand
that everything in this world

524
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,770
revolves around money,

525
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,890
except money itself.

526
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,100
Money is related to one's dreams.

527
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,130
And you seem to have belittled mine.

528
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,740
Therefore,

529
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,700
your opportunity is gone now.

530
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,930
What do you mean?

531
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,600
Have you forgotten whose fundings

532
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,180
T4 owes for its glory today?

533
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,090
There's an old Chinese saying.

534
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,530
Great kindness repaid with ingratitude.

535
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,100
No kindness needs a lifetime of repayment.

536
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,890
Furthermore,

537
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,170
while we were negotiating our ties,

538
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,330
your little brother, Gui,

539
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,410
struck a money deal with me.

540
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,930
He wants you dead.

541
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,540
Plus he has offered me

542
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,940
something I simply can't refuse.

543
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,820
You liar.

544
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,820
Tell Old Gui

545
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,410
that the job is done.

546
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,250
Have him come over

547
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,050
to negotiate the remaining terms
of the goods supply and market sharing

548
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,060
as soon as possible.

549
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,650
Yes.

550
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,180
Master.

551
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,290
People think my resources come from

552
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,260
T4 alone.

553
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,210
But they never know

554
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,140
my greatest asset is you,

555
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,580
Zhuo Ran.

556
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,220
I owe it to your cultivation, Master.

557
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,980
Here, have a sit.

558
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,210
Yes.

559
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,780
Try out my cooking.

560
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,010
Master.

561
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,540
How does it taste?

562
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,410
Zhuo Ran.

563
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,780
Hasn't it been eight years since you
last set foot on China?

564
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,860
It's been 8 years and 27 days.

565
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,330
Pack up.

566
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,730
You'll be heading there.

567
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,570
Can I bring my mother along?

568
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,660
Have you forgotten that

569
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,340
she needs to recuperate?

570
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,460
Don't worry.

571
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,090
Once you return,

572
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,090
I'll arrange a short reunion.

573
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,490
Sounds good?

574
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,370
Yes.

575
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,130
What's the mission?

576
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,850
Dong'an University of China recently

577
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,900
invented a new form of medical sedatives.

578
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,250
I need the formula
and its person-in-charge,

579
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,060
Xia Guang Yuan.

580
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,610
Perhaps his daughter rings a bell.

581
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,940
Xia Chu.

582
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,300
I got it.

583
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,290
We've already locked

584
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,780
onto this dark web platform called

585
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,220
City of Desires.

586
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,180
Many recent cases of drug trafficking
in the city

587
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,570
are connected to this platform.

588
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,970
After our technical team

589
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,260
hacked into the server,

590
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,020
they collected metadata

591
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,490
for further analysis and interpretation.

592
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,010
We gradually found

593
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,650
some basic information
about the mastermind behind the platform.

594
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,700
This person uses an online account named

595
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,290
Dreadful Pirate.

596
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,490
Just moments ago,

597
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,980
he published several images

598
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,060
mourning the death

599
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,090
of several T4 mercenaries.

600
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,650
Besides that,

601
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,410
he even initiated

602
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,900
a suicide mission game

603
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,620
using high monetary rewards as bait.

604
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,620
Various mission cards

605
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,450
are randomly published

606
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,170
to incite netizens

607
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,170
to commit suicide missions.

608
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,250
<i>Although the motive is unclear,</i>

609
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,260
<i>it has already caused
terrible ramifications.</i>

610
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,730
<i>Higher-ups have called for
a special task force</i>

611
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,460
<i>led by the chief
of Criminal Investigation Detachment Unit</i>

612
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,370
<i>Rao Feng,</i>

613
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,890
<i>along with Narcotics Divison,
Financial Investigation Division</i>

614
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,380
<i>Cyber Crime Division
and various other divisions</i>

615
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,850
<i>to identify the whereabouts</i>

616
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,340
<i>of Dreadful Pirate.</i>

617
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,890
<i>According to the latest intel,</i>

618
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,940
Dreadful Pirate is hiding somewhere
amidst our country's borders.

619
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,140
It's likely related

620
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,730
to the mercenaries hired by T4.

621
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,490
If we were to arrest them,

622
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,250
the police would need your help.

623
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,220
No problem.

624
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,330
I'll inform the Thunder Commando
to get ready immediately.

625
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,180
Once the mission is approved,

626
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,740
we'll assist in the operation.

627
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,780
Thank you.

628
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,450
She asked me to lend her
my pair of shoes.

629
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,210
But I didn't have an extra pair.

630
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,130
I think Army Officer Liang was the one

631
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,460
who brought her those.

632
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,500
How can I help you?

633
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,640
I bet

634
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,260
the shoes and military uniform
you're wearing now

635
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,460
were delivered by Army Officer Liang.

636
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,010
Of course not.

637
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,530
He's pursuing you?

638
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,930
Impossible.

639
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,900
Are you guys together?

640
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,540
Nope.

641
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,100
He seems to be close to Dr Zhang.

642
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,060
How should I know about that?

643
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,700
So the reason you were selected to attend

644
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,900
that international medical
training program in Isaia

645
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,340
was because he talked
to Dr Zhang about it?

646
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,930
Dr Zhang.

647
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,010
Why aren't you doing this in the office?

648
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,330
It's too noisy there.

649
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,900
You heard gossips?

650
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,100
You heard them too?

651
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,540
It's easy to guess.

652
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,220
You should know that

653
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,420
you're our first ever resident doctor

654
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:49,810
to have participated

655
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,620
in a foreign aid medical program.

656
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,220
You're also the first ever resident doctor

657
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,180
to stand in front of the operating table.

658
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,330
Others of the same age as you

659
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,700
are still busy practising how to stitch.

660
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,060
Hence comes the gossip.

661
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,690
You have to learn to handle them.

662
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,380
Why should I?

663
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,590
To wear the crown

664
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,089
is to bear its weight.

665
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,450
What you have to do now

666
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,129
is to work as hard as you can.

667
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,129
Let those who talk

668
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,890
feel hopeless.

669
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:25,530
Then, they'll stop talking.

670
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,129
Will they really stop?

671
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,500
Of course they will.

672
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,500
I'm certain of it.

673
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,419
It's because I

674
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,140
experienced it too.

675
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,060
Do you train like this all the time?

676
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,970
Of course. It's a must.

677
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,980
Ever since the day I first did stitching

678
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,370
and was kicked out of the operating room
by my teacher.

679
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,060
Every day.

680
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,740
But this time during the day,

681
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,339
isn't it bright enough already?

682
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,339
Why do you also need a candle?

683
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,050
They aren't for the training.

684
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,500
It's for those

685
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,770
who went on the operating table

686
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,500
but never made it back alive.

687
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,180
Because of them,

688
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,660
I remind myself

689
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,660
that I can't slack even for a moment.

690
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,860
Remember this, Xia Chu.

691
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,460
Nothing is more important
than a person's life and death.

692
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,980
I understand now.

693
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,420
Mi Gu.

694
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,100
Hey girl.

695
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,100
Do you miss me?

696
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,260
<i>I do.</i>

697
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,820
<i>I miss you a lot.</i>

698
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,980
How are you doing there?

699
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,540
Is your residency life

700
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,580
full of blood, sweat and tears?

701
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,380
<i>Not only that.</i>

702
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,780
It's an imperial court drama
here every day.

703
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,780
When I started medical school,

704
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,340
<i>I thought
I just needed skills to survive.</i>

705
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,650
Only now do I realise that

706
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,780
emotional intelligence is super important.

707
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,260
No matter how terrible it is,

708
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,650
at least you've got
a free mansion to live in.

709
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,570
Am I right?

710
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,540
Forget it.

711
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,300
The landlord is forcing me to move out.

712
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,780
<i>Mi Gu.</i>

713
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,540
<i>How I wish you were my landlady.</i>

714
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,940
Well, I'm always ready to share

715
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,780
half of my tatami bed with you.

716
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Mi Gu.

717
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,850
You're the best.

718
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,780
I'll leave you with that thought.

719
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,140
I've got a cab to catch. Goodbye.

720
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,780
Bye.

721
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,050
What doesn't kill me

722
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,300
only makes me stronger.

723
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,500
Thunder Commando unit,
check your communication devices.

724
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Once we're at the borders,

725
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,660
our orders
are to capture the target alive.

726
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,700
But if the target fires,

727
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,940
we won't hold back.

728
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,530
Yes, sir.

729
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,500
Alright, let's have a look.

730
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,420
Who knows?

731
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,580
We might find a better place
than this one.

732
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,500
<i>I don't want to go. I like it here.</i>

733
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,860
What a pity. This house is so exquisite.

734
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,700
I was almost getting used to it.

735
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,540
Stop thinking, stop thinking.

736
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,540
Delete that thought.

737
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,530
Look for a new place.

738
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,620
Look for a new place.

739
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
You can do it.

740
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,300
<i>Hi, Dr Xia.</i>

741
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,620
<i>I'm Chen Meng Zhen,
Luo Xiao Jun's mother.</i>

742
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,700
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

743
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,020
Yes. How can I help you?

744
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,260
Well...

745
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,620
Two days back,

746
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,780
Xiao Jun kept complaining
about tightness in his chest.

747
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,250
He even fainted in school earlier today.

748
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,730
I was wondering

749
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,660
<i>if it could be some kind of repercussion
from his previous head injury?</i>

750
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,260
Has he done a check-up?

751
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,740
I brought him to the community hospital
during the day.

752
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,950
But their equipment was broken.

753
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,460
So they couldn't do an X-ray.

754
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,380
How is he doing now?

755
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,650
<i>Right now</i>

756
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,900
<i>he's sleeping.</i>

757
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,870
Mum.

758
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,630
I feel terrible.

759
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,900
Mum.

760
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,860
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

761
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,500
Don't worry. Just observe him for now.

762
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,220
If it gets worse,

763
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,620
come straight to the hospital
tomorrow morning.

764
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,860
I'll be there.

765
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,420
That'd be great. Thank you so much.

766
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,380
You're welcome. Goodbye.

767
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,060
Could it be that I didn't dress
the wound properly?

768
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,420
What's the point of raising
a lazy cat like you?

769
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,940
A holograph?

770
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,580
Looks like someone's messing with us.

771
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,590
Whale.

772
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,860
What's the situation?

773
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,510
The other party definitely
has ill intentions.

774
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,820
You have to be careful.

775
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,580
Yes, sir.

776
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,110
No matter what case this is,

777
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,730
or who the mastermind is,

778
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,520
I'll get to the bottom of it.
