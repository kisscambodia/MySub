<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,120
<i>Episode 2</i>

4
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,070
Do you think I'm short on cash?

5
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,660
If you can't afford a moving company,

6
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,700
I can sponsor you.

7
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,820
Don't be afraid to ask.

8
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,670
Look at him being all obnoxious.

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,509
That one, two, three, four, too.

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,300
He can't wait to see me

11
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,470
fall into despair.

12
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,190
Who gave him that confidence?

13
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,820
How hard is it to get a new place?

14
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,700
I can't believe

15
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,950
that in the entire Ningjiang District,

16
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,710
there's not a place for me.

17
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,280
Where do you usually crash at night?

18
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,180
The whole world belongs to me.

19
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,750
But I really hate moving.

20
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,020
I've got to go to work, look for a place,

21
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,220
then pack up and clean up again.

22
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,550
I'll really go mad.

23
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,990
Calm down.

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,070
It's okay. I must remain calm.

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,310
As a modern lady,

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,380
I won't be defeated

27
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,670
by such a trivial matter.

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,829
Just focus on doing the laundry first.

29
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,990
He says a little pain in life
doesn't matter...

30
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,470
It's just moving to a new place, isn't it?

31
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,470
Anything on tonight?

32
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,840
Where did you come from?
You gave me a scare.

33
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,910
Do you have anything to do tonight?

34
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,390
I'll be looking for new places online

35
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,920
so I can move out soon.

36
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,510
I need you to come with me.

37
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,350
I'm not done hanging up my laundry yet.

38
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,510
It's for something more important
than this.

39
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,400
A kid was hurt,

40
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,579
but he refuses to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,550
I need a doctor.

42
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,310
So I'm needed only when something happens?

43
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,430
Isn't it a doctor's duty
to heal the wounded and save the dying?

44
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,190
Let's go.

45
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,030
Is that kid

46
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,590
-very important to you?
-Yes.

47
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,670
What if...

48
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,829
I'll do my best.

49
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,830
Xiao Jun.

50
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,110
Liang Mu Ze.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,110
Alright, let me see it.

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,020
Now you're embarrassed?

53
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,550
I just asked you to wash up
but you didn't.

54
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,390
He insisted on waiting for you.

55
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,030
You got hit?

56
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,870
I brought this madam doctor

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,990
to look at your injury.

58
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,670
Madam doctor?

59
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,270
Just call me sister.

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,430
Pretty please, handsome boy?

61
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,750
Let me have a look.

62
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,190
It's too dark in here.
Do you have a torchlight?

63
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,470
Yes. Mu Ze.

64
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,470
On the table over there.

65
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,480
<i>Just give up, Mu Ze.</i>

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,870
<i>I know you're almost out.</i>

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
<i>How would you know that?</i>

68
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,590
<i>If you can, so can I.</i>

69
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,510
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

70
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,790
<i>I can't.</i>

71
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,670
-<i>You lost.</i>
-<i>I lost.</i>

72
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,680
<i>I lost.</i>

73
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,910
<i>There's always a bigger fish.</i>

74
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,000
-<i>Let's continue this tomorrow.</i>
-<i>Sure.</i>

75
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,110
<i>I'm always up for that.</i>

76
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,960
<i>Anytime.</i>

77
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,790
<i>Don't move.</i>

78
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,230
<i>Let me try out my new camera.</i>

79
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,590
<i>Go away.</i>

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,150
<i>Three, two, one. Look up.</i>

81
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,710
Mu Ze.

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,390
Now close your eyes.

83
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,550
Don't move. It's going to sting a little.

84
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,270
Hold on. It's almost done.

85
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,200
Hold on just a little bit more.

86
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,310
Xiao Jun is so brave.

87
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,030
Done.

88
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,320
Will there be a scar?

89
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,710
It probably won't.

90
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,790
A scar is nothing.

91
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,660
Am I right?

92
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,790
We're tough men.

93
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,430
Mu Ze, you two have a seat.

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,400
I need to head out for a while.

95
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,830
Where are you going?

96
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
Look after the kid.

97
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,550
Liang Mu Ze.

98
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,780
Liang Mu Ze, don't leave.

99
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,230
I'm not. I'll just go
to see where she's going.

100
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,310
You promise?

101
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,630
I promise. Don't worry.

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Have some fun with madam doctor.

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,910
It's sister.

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,790
How dare he.

105
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,790
What's your relationship
with Liang Mu Ze?

106
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,140
To be precise, we actually

107
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,470
have just really known each other today.

108
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,900
What about you and him?

109
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,600
We've known each other for many years.

110
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,310
He's my father.

111
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Where are you going?

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm fine.

113
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,950
Please head back first.
Your friend's still there.

114
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,590
I... I'll be back soon.

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,790
It doesn't seem like you're fine.

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,040
What's the matter?

117
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,360
I...

118
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,320
Xiao Jun got bullied in class today.

119
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,510
He panicked and banged his head
against the door.

120
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,480
After that, he fainted.

121
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,590
Although his father is dead,

122
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,950
Xiao Jun has always been very obedient.

123
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,560
I've never hit him.

124
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,070
I went through a lot to raise him.

125
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,550
Who are they to bully him?

126
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,870
They won't give me an explanation
so I'm getting it myself.

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,559
Please don't stop me, Mu Ze.

128
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,880
I don't mean to stop you.

129
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,940
Xiao Jun...

130
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,640
How much longer can you
defend him like that?

131
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,870
And you're going with a torchlight?

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,680
What can it do?

133
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,070
Stop touching it.
There are germs on your hand.

134
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,760
Let it heal on its own.

135
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
Why are your lips purplish?

136
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,790
They've always been that way.

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
Do you usually feel dizzy

138
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,760
or experience chest tightness?

139
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,910
No.

140
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,160
No?

141
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,150
Well I... I've done my best.

142
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,160
The dressing isn't really that ugly,
is it?

143
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,710
Does it hurt?

144
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Xiao Jun.

145
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,160
Listen to me.

146
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,510
In future,

147
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,000
if someone tries to bully you...

148
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,190
I was wrong.

149
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,790
Next time, I'll avoid it immediately.

150
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
No, it's not your fault.

151
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,470
You can't avoid it.

152
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,550
If someone bullies you,

153
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,110
you retaliate immediately.

154
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,190
You hear that?

155
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,360
You can't bully others,

156
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,910
but you can't let others bully you either.

157
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,030
Got it?

158
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,910
But I'm afraid.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,880
What are you afraid of?

160
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,720
Your bully feels afraid too.

161
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,950
He only has two fists and two legs
just like you.

162
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,240
As long as you fight back,
he'll be afraid too.

163
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
And he won't come at you again.

164
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,510
Got it?

165
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,400
Really?

166
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,790
Let me show you a few tricks.

167
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,600
-Okay.
-Come here.

168
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
Thanks for talking
to Miss Meng Zhen all night.

169
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,120
It's fine.

170
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
Is Xiao Jun

171
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,320
really your son?

172
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,640
Yes.

173
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,110
Your personalities are different.

174
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,830
What do you mean?

175
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,510
He really cares for you.

176
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,200
I know.

177
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,400
He'll believe and do

178
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,910
whatever you tell him to.

179
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,280
Is that a problem?

180
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,320
Do you really think the fighting skills
you taught him

181
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,400
will make him untouchable?

182
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
I never meant it that way.

183
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
Why did you teach him to fight then?

184
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,070
It's called resistance.

185
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,270
When you're bullied,

186
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
you won't necessarily win with your fist.

187
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,790
But at least,

188
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,910
it'll make sure

189
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,990
you won't become

190
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,200
a target of bullies anymore.

191
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,950
Is there really no other tactful way
to resolve this?

192
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,390
Must it be an eye for an eye?

193
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,000
He will have

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,400
to face this world by himself.

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,150
Thanks for sending me to the hospital.

196
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,560
Go home and get some sleep.

197
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,950
I don't really need any sleep.

198
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Sleep probably doesn't need you.

199
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Is there a medical explanation for that?

200
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,590
Not that I know of.

201
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,710
But my woman's hunch says,

202
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,550
the body of a sleepless person

203
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,270
harbours

204
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,200
a battered and weary soul.

205
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,800
Did I get it right, Captain Liang?

206
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,390
Stop being conceited, Dr Xia.

207
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,560
Goodbye.

208
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,720
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

209
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,670
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

210
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,950
You have dark circles under your eyes.

211
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,310
Where did you party last night?

212
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
I had a vocational study.

213
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,910
Get changed quickly.

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
Dr Zhang will be here soon.

215
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,860
<i>Miss Lan</i>

216
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,070
Miss Lan.

217
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,780
<i>Hey, girl.</i>

218
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,360
How's the place?

219
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,240
<i>I'm getting ready to move.</i>

220
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,710
Why?

221
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,030
I was thinking of...

222
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,630
Hold your thought.

223
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,080
He has a son. Do you know that?

224
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,480
What?

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,180
A son?

226
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,520
What son? I didn't know that.

227
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,200
And yet you were so eager to push

228
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,550
your daughter into relationship hell?

229
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,760
Are you even my biological mother?

230
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,120
I...

231
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,830
<i>Enough. I won't blame you for it.</i>

232
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,030
I need to work now. Talk again later.

233
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,230
Love you. Mwah!

234
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
Goodbye, Miss Lan.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,150
Wait, girl.

236
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,310
A son?

237
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,080
Xiao Xiao, do you have
an extra pair of shoes?

238
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,870
Didn't you keep a pair here?

239
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,950
I forgot.

240
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
In that case, I can't help you.

241
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,000
To hell with it then.

242
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,030
A week ago, the patient did

243
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,190
a coronary artery bypass graft.

244
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,790
Since yesterday,

245
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,270
his fluid intake has been 2000 ml,

246
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,830
urine output has been 2100 ml.

247
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,870
Intake and output volumes are balanced.

248
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,230
The drainage tube was removed yesterday.

249
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
She is doing well so far.

250
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,950
You caught a cold?

251
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,710
No.

252
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,750
I'm just a little sensitive

253
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,960
to the perfume of this doctor.

254
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,960
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
My apologies.

256
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
You're doing good.

257
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,990
Rest well now.

258
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,840
Why are you back here?

259
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,360
Liang Mu Ze.

260
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,860
This will count as a reward

261
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,210
for treating Xiao Jun yesterday.

262
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,520
Must you draw a line in everything?

263
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,010
Yes.

264
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,370
Fine, whatever you say.

265
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,610
Things like bangles, rings,

266
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,480
brooches and earrings

267
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,890
that interfere with your work

268
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,490
and affect the recovery of patients
must all be discarded.

269
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,730
Keep in mind.

270
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,810
You're either a good or bad doctor,
regardless of gender.

271
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,160
Xia Chu is working
without her military outfit.

272
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,480
Why am I the only one being scolded?

273
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,760
Xia Chu.

274
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,730
I'm here.

275
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,170
Why are you so smug?

276
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,010
Why aren't you wearing the military outfit
during working hours?

277
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,370
No.

278
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,890
I'm properly attired. Look.

279
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm a professional military doctor.

280
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,640
How can I make

281
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,890
a rookie mistake?

282
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,760
Very good.

283
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,130
Correct mistakes if you've made any,

284
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,290
guard against them if you haven't.

285
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,720
Especially you.

286
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,120
By the way,

287
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,400
that young officer

288
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,560
who returned from Isaia with us,

289
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,210
how is he doing?

290
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,069
He was already discharged
from ICU yesterday.

291
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,319
According to the order of higher-ups,

292
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,170
he is now placed in the private wad.

293
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,490
Alright.

294
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,599
Let's check on him first.

295
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,560
Yes.

296
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,880
Captain Liang,
are you here to visit the patient?

297
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
I was initially here to deliver something.

298
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,770
I came to see Tian Yong since I'm here.

299
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,330
How are you feeling?

300
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,690
Is everything good?

301
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,810
Xia Chu.

302
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes.

303
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,760
Describe the patient's condition.

304
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,090
Patient's name, Tian Yong.
Age, 32 years old.

305
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,570
Because he was shot
in the left thoracic cavity,

306
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,040
he was given a thoracotomy

307
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,250
by the Isaia Joint Medical Team.

308
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,760
The bullet was removed.

309
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,960
Two days after the surgery,

310
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,530
he was transferred from Isaia
to our ICU.

311
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,600
After receiving medical treatment,

312
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,890
his condition is good.

313
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,480
Currently,

314
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,730
his blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg,

315
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,810
heartbeat is stable.

316
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,640
Thoracic cavity and pericardium drainage
tube flow is steady.

317
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,640
The rate of drainage in 24 hours

318
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,690
is 100 ml.

319
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,810
What should be done next?

320
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,840
Conduct an echocardiography
and chest CT scan,

321
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,170
a blood routine and a full-set
blood coagulation examination.

322
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,920
Check if the thoracic cavity and
the pericardial drainage

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,410
flow rates have reduced

324
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,760
and whether the colour
has gradually turned clearer,

325
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,810
which will decide
if we can remove the tube soon.

326
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,840
In other words,

327
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,690
your recovery is going well.

328
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,770
Dr Zhang.

329
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,570
Will there be any medical repercussions?

330
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,290
Are you experiencing any yourself?

331
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,930
Xia Chu.

332
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,970
Let me introduce.

333
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,120
He

334
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,000
is the officer

335
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,210
I told you about in Isaia

336
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,760
who was injured even worse than Tian Yong.

337
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,960
You must be a major now, aren't you?

338
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,970
Chief, I've heard so much of you.

339
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,090
We know each other.

340
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,450
Really?

341
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,090
Why didn't you mention it?

342
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,050
We don't know each other too well.

343
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,440
We only crossed paths

344
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,690
back in Isaia

345
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,930
when I was held hostage.

346
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,610
Now I remember.

347
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,520
You were the one who saved the hostage,
weren't you?

348
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,320
Since you know each other,

349
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,570
why are you so discreet?

350
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,170
I don't know.

351
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,650
We even met a few times
upon returning.

352
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,850
Is there a cause for it?

353
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,960
No.

354
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,890
If she says so.

355
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,690
Alright then.

356
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,010
In that case,

357
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,290
if there's any problem
with Lieutenant Tian's condition,

358
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,600
you can look for Dr Xia in future.

359
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,570
No problem.

360
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,410
We're done here. Next wad.

361
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,440
What were you doing back there,
Liang Mu Ze?

362
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,410
What do you mean?

363
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,480
Do you know

364
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,730
that what you said just now

365
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,090
will bring me

366
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,160
a lot of troubles?

367
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,730
I only spoke the truth.

368
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,970
Are you a pretty little fool?

369
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,730
If you can't handle gossips,

370
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,770
that is your problem.

371
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,170
Liang Mu Ze.

372
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,690
Liang Mu Ze.

373
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,930
You don't call me chief now, do you?

374
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,610
Listen, Dr Xia.

375
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,690
If you think it is right

376
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,850
to cast people away

377
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,810
after using them,

378
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,610
then continue with it.

379
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,020
I don't care.

380
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,290
But I've told you before.

381
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,850
I like simplicity

382
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,290
and straightforwardness.

383
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,410
It's not something honourable to know you.

384
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,970
So there's no point in lying about it.

385
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,170
If you like to act,

386
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,410
then suit yourself.

387
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,570
I have no obligation to play along.

388
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,130
Something is not right.

389
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,970
What is it?

390
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,890
Aren't you from the Special Forces?

391
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,770
So?

392
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,410
A person from the Special Forces
shouldn't be

393
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,290
arrogant, cool, inarticulate and tough?

394
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,770
Why is it different when it comes to you?

395
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,780
You're so talkative.

396
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,680
I bet if you were

397
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,280
on a prolonged ambush mission

398
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,570
where you can't speak nor move,

399
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,330
the silence could just kill you.

400
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,400
When you move out,

401
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,370
make sure you take all your stuff.

402
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,130
Captain Liang, join us.

403
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm done.

404
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,530
I'm a pretty little fool?

405
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,520
I can't take this.

406
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,610
Has she lost her mind?

407
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,050
What a joke.
How am I a pretty little fool?

408
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,210
She called an officer
a pretty little fool.

409
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,570
Tell me, Tian Yong.

410
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,930
As the top-notch graduate
of military school,

411
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,730
your captain,

412
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,970
in my every aspect,

413
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,010
whether it's my physique,

414
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,330
or my military skills,

415
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,330
or my cognitive aptitudes,

416
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,120
aren't they all equally excellent?

417
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,490
How can she call me a blockhead?

418
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,250
This isn't the worst part.

419
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,730
What really pissed me off is that

420
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,890
she pretended not knowing me

421
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,450
in front of her colleagues.

422
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,180
What's wrong with knowing me?

423
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,530
Tell me what's wrong with that?

424
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,850
Does it embarrass her?

425
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,440
You're just sneering.

426
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,770
Why don't you say something?

427
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,130
Did I feed you too fast?

428
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,820
I'm asking you.

429
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,580
I've answered you.

430
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,810
What did you say?

431
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,410
Via Morse code?

432
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,810
I've been thinking

433
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,050
if we should have

434
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,210
some kind of secret way

435
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,300
of communication between us.

436
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,810
We should, shouldn't we?

437
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,960
If someday you are captured
by the enemy...

438
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,930
Nonsense.

439
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,530
Why isn't it you being captured?

440
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,770
I'm just saying.

441
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,000
You can't do that either.

442
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,740
Let's be clear that there's no way

443
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,650
for it to happen in my troop.

444
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,290
You're being too idealistic.

445
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,810
Major.

446
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,810
Without ideals, why are you
even a soldier?

447
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,530
Without ideals, how can you be a soldier?

448
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,010
Didn't you start off as a soldier
because of your ideals?

449
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,050
I did it for survival.

450
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,410
I grew up in an orphanage

451
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,730
with no parents.

452
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,810
I couldn't find a decent job
after graduating from high school.

453
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,250
What ideals did I have?

454
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,530
I was looking to survive.

455
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,130
Tian Yong.

456
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,660
Listen.

457
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,860
You're wrong.

458
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,940
Even if in the beginning,

459
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,970
you joined the forces
merely because of survival,

460
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,450
you've still managed to stay in it
for so long.

461
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,490
After so many years,

462
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,560
your ideals

463
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,050
have already transcended
the mere reason of surviving.

464
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,760
Am I right?

465
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,940
Don't you deny that.

466
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,460
It's pointless to deny it either.

467
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,010
Look at this.

468
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,540
This here

469
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,530
is the best proof.

470
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,250
What's that?

471
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,200
It was this?

472
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,170
Yes.

473
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,930
Hold on to it.

474
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,490
Keep it, so you'll always remember.

475
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,170
Thanks, captain.

476
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,210
Take it.

477
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,410
That's so kind of you.

478
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,690
Ouch.

479
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,570
It hurts.

480
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,970
That's good.

481
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,380
That way you'll remember.

482
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,400
Brace yourself.

483
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,370
My wound hurts.

484
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,010
Alright. I'll remove it.

485
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,470
<i>Somewhere in Southeast Asia,
Willick, T4 Headquarters</i>

486
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,540
Why did the mission fail?

487
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,530
The local police

488
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,010
hired help from Hunter Military School.

489
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,850
They were all top-notch special forces
from various countries.

490
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,090
What about the thing I wanted?

491
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,050
It's gone.

492
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,060
But we can find another one.

493
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,730
Listen.

494
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,020
I'm running out of time.

495
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,170
-I must have it as soon...
-Of course.

496
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,100
Just like the steak before us.

497
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,060
As long as one can afford it,

498
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,890
anyone can have a taste of it.

499
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,820
Money is not a problem.

500
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,090
Once I've received it

501
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,890
and confirmed that it's compatible,

502
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,800
you'll have the rest of the payment.

503
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,620
Again, just like this steak,

504
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,370
time determines its doneness.

505
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,970
Likewise,

506
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,420
its taste will vary accordingly too.

507
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,940
What are you trying to say?

508
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,620
The organ provider is from Country A.

509
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,410
This matter has now alerted
not only the Isaia police,

510
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,700
but the Interpol is watching closely too.

511
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,170
Trying to retrieve your goods

512
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,490
under such dire conditions

513
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,970
requires a higher price now,
don't you agree?

514
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,890
You're fooling with me.

515
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,970
Business is business.

516
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,220
Great.

517
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,690
So it is.

518
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,050
Fine.

519
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,250
You may be in power in China,

520
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,900
but over here,

521
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,650
I'm in charge.

522
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,220
Boss, don't move.

523
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,170
You must understand
that everything in this world

524
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,570
revolves around money,

525
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,690
except money itself.

526
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,900
Money is related to one's dreams.

527
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,930
And you seem to have belittled mine.

528
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,540
Therefore,

529
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,500
your opportunity is gone now.

530
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,730
What do you mean?

531
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,400
Have you forgotten whose fundings

532
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,980
T4 owes for its glory today?

533
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,890
There's an old Chinese saying.

534
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,330
Great kindness repaid with ingratitude.

535
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,900
No kindness needs a lifetime of repayment.

536
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,690
Furthermore,

537
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,970
while we were negotiating our ties,

538
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,130
your little brother, Gui,

539
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,210
struck a money deal with me.

540
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,730
He wants you dead.

541
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,340
Plus he has offered me

542
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,740
something I simply can't refuse.

543
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,620
You liar.

544
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,620
Tell Old Gui

545
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,210
that the job is done.

546
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,050
Have him come over

547
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,850
to negotiate the remaining terms
of the goods supply and market sharing

548
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,860
as soon as possible.

549
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,450
Yes.

550
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,980
Master.

551
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,090
People think my resources come from

552
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,060
T4 alone.

553
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,010
But they never know

554
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,940
my greatest asset is you,

555
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,380
Zhuo Ran.

556
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,020
I owe it to your cultivation, Master.

557
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,780
Here, have a sit.

558
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,010
Yes.

559
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,580
Try out my cooking.

560
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,810
Master.

561
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,340
How does it taste?

562
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,210
Zhuo Ran.

563
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,580
Hasn't it been eight years since you
last set foot on China?

564
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,660
It's been 8 years and 27 days.

565
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,130
Pack up.

566
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,530
You'll be heading there.

567
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,370
Can I bring my mother along?

568
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,460
Have you forgotten that

569
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,140
she needs to recuperate?

570
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,260
Don't worry.

571
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,890
Once you return,

572
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,890
I'll arrange a short reunion.

573
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,290
Sounds good?

574
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,170
Yes.

575
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,930
What's the mission?

576
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,650
Dong'an University of China recently

577
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,700
invented a new form of medical sedatives.

578
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,050
I need the formula
and its person-in-charge,

579
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,860
Xia Guang Yuan.

580
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,410
Perhaps his daughter rings a bell.

581
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,740
Xia Chu.

582
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,100
I got it.

583
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,090
We've already locked

584
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,580
onto this dark web platform called

585
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,020
City of Desires.

586
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,980
Many recent cases of drug trafficking
in the city

587
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,370
are connected to this platform.

588
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,770
After our technical team

589
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,060
hacked into the server,

590
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,820
they collected metadata

591
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,290
for further analysis and interpretation.

592
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,810
We gradually found

593
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,450
some basic information
about the mastermind behind the platform.

594
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,500
This person uses an online account named

595
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,090
Dreadful Pirate.

596
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,290
Just moments ago,

597
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,780
he published several images

598
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,860
mourning the death

599
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,890
of several T4 mercenaries.

600
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,450
Besides that,

601
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,210
he even initiated

602
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,700
a suicide mission game

603
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,420
using high monetary rewards as bait.

604
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,420
Various mission cards

605
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,250
are randomly published

606
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,970
to incite netizens

607
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,970
to commit suicide missions.

608
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,050
<i>Although the motive is unclear,</i>

609
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,060
<i>it has already caused
terrible ramifications.</i>

610
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,530
<i>Higher-ups have called for
a special task force</i>

611
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,260
<i>led by the chief
of Criminal Investigation Detachment Unit</i>

612
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,170
<i>Rao Feng,</i>

613
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,690
<i>along with Narcotics Divison,
Financial Investigation Division</i>

614
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,180
<i>Cyber Crime Division
and various other divisions</i>

615
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,650
<i>to identify the whereabouts</i>

616
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,140
<i>of Dreadful Pirate.</i>

617
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,690
<i>According to the latest intel,</i>

618
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,740
Dreadful Pirate is hiding somewhere
amidst our country's borders.

619
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,940
It's likely related

620
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,530
to the mercenaries hired by T4.

621
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,290
If we were to arrest them,

622
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,050
the police would need your help.

623
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,020
No problem.

624
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,130
I'll inform the Thunder Commando
to get ready immediately.

625
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,980
Once the mission is approved,

626
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,540
we'll assist in the operation.

627
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,580
Thank you.

628
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,250
She asked me to lend her
my pair of shoes.

629
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,010
But I didn't have an extra pair.

630
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,930
I think Army Officer Liang was the one

631
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,260
who brought her those.

632
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,300
How can I help you?

633
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,440
I bet

634
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,060
the shoes and military uniform
you're wearing now

635
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,260
were delivered by Army Officer Liang.

636
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,810
Of course not.

637
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,330
He's pursuing you?

638
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:42,730
Impossible.

639
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,700
Are you guys together?

640
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,340
Nope.

641
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,900
He seems to be close to Dr Zhang.

642
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,860
How should I know about that?

643
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,500
So the reason you were selected to attend

644
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,700
that international medical
training program in Isaia

645
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,140
was because he talked
to Dr Zhang about it?

646
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,730
Dr Zhang.

647
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,810
Why aren't you doing this in the office?

648
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,130
It's too noisy there.

649
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,700
You heard gossips?

650
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,900
You heard them too?

651
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,340
It's easy to guess.

652
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,020
You should know that

653
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,220
you're our first ever resident doctor

654
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,610
to have participated

655
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,420
in a foreign aid medical program.

656
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,020
You're also the first ever resident doctor

657
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,980
to stand in front of the operating table.

658
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,130
Others of the same age as you

659
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,500
are still busy practising how to stitch.

660
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,860
Hence comes the gossip.

661
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,490
You have to learn to handle them.

662
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,180
Why should I?

663
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,390
To wear the crown

664
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,889
is to bear its weight.

665
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,250
What you have to do now

666
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,929
is to work as hard as you can.

667
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,929
Let those who talk

668
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,690
feel hopeless.

669
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,330
Then, they'll stop talking.

670
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:28,929
Will they really stop?

671
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,300
Of course they will.

672
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,300
I'm certain of it.

673
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,219
It's because I

674
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,940
experienced it too.

675
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,860
Do you train like this all the time?

676
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,770
Of course. It's a must.

677
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,780
Ever since the day I first did stitching

678
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,170
and was kicked out of the operating room
by my teacher.

679
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,860
Every day.

680
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,540
But this time during the day,

681
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,139
isn't it bright enough already?

682
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,139
Why do you also need a candle?

683
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,850
They aren't for the training.

684
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,300
It's for those

685
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,570
who went on the operating table

686
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,300
but never made it back alive.

687
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,980
Because of them,

688
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,460
I remind myself

689
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,460
that I can't slack even for a moment.

690
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,660
Remember this, Xia Chu.

691
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,260
Nothing is more important
than a person's life and death.

692
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,780
I understand now.

693
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,220
Mi Gu.

694
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,900
Hey girl.

695
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,900
Do you miss me?

696
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,060
<i>I do.</i>

697
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,620
<i>I miss you a lot.</i>

698
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,780
How are you doing there?

699
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,340
Is your residency life

700
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,380
full of blood, sweat and tears?

701
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
<i>Not only that.</i>

702
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,580
It's an imperial court drama
here every day.

703
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,580
When I started medical school,

704
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,140
<i>I thought
I just needed skills to survive.</i>

705
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,450
Only now do I realise that

706
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,580
emotional intelligence is super important.

707
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,060
No matter how terrible it is,

708
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,450
at least you've got
a free mansion to live in.

709
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,370
Am I right?

710
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,340
Forget it.

711
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,100
The landlord is forcing me to move out.

712
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,580
<i>Mi Gu.</i>

713
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,340
<i>How I wish you were my landlady.</i>

714
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,740
Well, I'm always ready to share

715
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,580
half of my tatami bed with you.

716
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Mi Gu.

717
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,650
You're the best.

718
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,580
I'll leave you with that thought.

719
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,940
I've got a cab to catch. Goodbye.

720
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,580
Bye.

721
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,850
What doesn't kill me

722
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,100
only makes me stronger.

723
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,300
Thunder Commando unit,
check your communication devices.

724
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
Once we're at the borders,

725
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,460
our orders
are to capture the target alive.

726
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,500
But if the target fires,

727
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,740
we won't hold back.

728
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,330
Yes, sir.

729
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,300
Alright, let's have a look.

730
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,220
Who knows?

731
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,380
We might find a better place
than this one.

732
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,300
<i>I don't want to go. I like it here.</i>

733
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,660
What a pity. This house is so exquisite.

734
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,500
I was almost getting used to it.

735
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,340
Stop thinking, stop thinking.

736
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,340
Delete that thought.

737
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,330
Look for a new place.

738
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,420
Look for a new place.

739
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
You can do it.

740
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,100
<i>Hi, Dr Xia.</i>

741
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,420
<i>I'm Chen Meng Zhen,
Luo Xiao Jun's mother.</i>

742
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,500
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

743
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,820
Yes. How can I help you?

744
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,060
Well...

745
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,420
Two days back,

746
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,580
Xiao Jun kept complaining
about tightness in his chest.

747
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,050
He even fainted in school earlier today.

748
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,530
I was wondering

749
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,460
<i>if it could be some kind of repercussion
from his previous head injury?</i>

750
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,060
Has he done a check-up?

751
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,540
I brought him to the community hospital
during the day.

752
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,750
But their equipment was broken.

753
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,260
So they couldn't do an X-ray.

754
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,180
How is he doing now?

755
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,450
<i>Right now</i>

756
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,700
<i>he's sleeping.</i>

757
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,670
Mum.

758
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,430
I feel terrible.

759
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,700
Mum.

760
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,660
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

761
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,300
Don't worry. Just observe him for now.

762
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,020
If it gets worse,

763
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,420
come straight to the hospital
tomorrow morning.

764
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,660
I'll be there.

765
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,220
That'd be great. Thank you so much.

766
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,180
You're welcome. Goodbye.

767
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,860
Could it be that I didn't dress
the wound properly?

768
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,220
What's the point of raising
a lazy cat like you?

769
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,740
A holograph?

770
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,380
Looks like someone's messing with us.

771
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,390
Whale.

772
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,660
What's the situation?

773
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,310
The other party definitely
has ill intentions.

774
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,620
You have to be careful.

775
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,380
Yes, sir.

776
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,910
No matter what case this is,

777
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,530
or who the mastermind is,

778
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,320
I'll get to the bottom of it.
