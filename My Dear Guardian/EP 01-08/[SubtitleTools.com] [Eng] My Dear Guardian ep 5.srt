<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>Episode 5</i>

4
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,220
Have you seen Dr Zhang?

5
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,190
He's in the dressing room.

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,830
Thank you.

7
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,870
You're welcome.

8
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,670
Dr Zhang!

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,030
I'm changing,
what are you doing?

10
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,190
Sorry! Sorry!

11
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,830
She's killing me.
How reckless!

12
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,350
Xia Chu, how inappropriate!

13
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,110
Just carry on and listen to me.

14
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,460
We might be able to use

15
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,940
interventional surgery
for Xiao Jun's ASD

16
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,390
but only if we can find a method

17
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,830
that is more intuitive than a CT scan

18
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,070
for understanding the condition
of his ASD.

19
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,990
I tell you what.

20
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,820
The most intuitive way is

21
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,230
to cut the heart open,

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,550
and it's the most accurate way.

23
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,940
And a 3D printed heart model.

24
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,700
3D printed heart model?

25
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,990
Do not take photos!

26
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,070
I just want to show
you the previous case.

27
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,470
Someone has succeeded before.

28
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,870
You get out first.

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,950
Get out!

30
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,460
<i>Dressing room</i>

31
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,110
Keep that in mind.

32
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,220
It's the men's dressing room.

33
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,350
I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,110
I was in a hurry.

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,470
Then...

36
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,710
Where's the case?

37
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,270
Look.

38
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,860
This is his echocardiography

39
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,790
and this.

40
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,270
Okay.

41
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,029
It's possible.

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,380
But I haven't done it before.

43
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,270
I might need to
consult with a company.

44
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,230
I have a classmate
who's in this line of work.

45
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,910
Then hurry up and contact him.

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,630
Okay.

47
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,590
Xia Chu?

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,070
It's me.

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,630
I have something to talk to you.

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,860
<i>Go ahead.</i>

51
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,940
There's a kid with
congenital heart disease.

52
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,950
His first operation failed.

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,029
We need your 3D printing technology

54
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,670
to print his heart model out

55
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,510
before we perform the second surgery.

56
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,500
To get a full overview

57
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,150
of the location and type of his ASD

58
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,870
and to practice the surgery in advance.

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,700
You may wait in there.

60
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,910
Boss will be right here soon.

61
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,590
Thank you.

62
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,030
Do you know the
origin of this sketch?

63
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:54,150
September 7, 2011.

64
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,190
It was my first day
transferring to a new school.

65
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,109
During recess,

66
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,190
someone invited me to play shuttlecock.

67
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,820
I was hesitant.

68
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,310
It wasn't that I don't want to.

69
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:05,070
Just that I was drawing

70
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,260
a girl with a

71
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,830
beautiful smile at that moment.

72
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,110
Hello, Xia Chu.

73
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,860
The CT scans and the data of

74
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,030
echocardiography of
the patient are all in here.

75
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,430
How long does it take
to complete the production?

76
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,270
About one week if everything goes well.

77
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,230
How about the fee?

78
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,310
It depends on the material you choose.

79
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,430
Will the quality of the

80
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,830
materials affect the
accuracy of the final model?

81
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,790
It won't affect much.

82
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,270
For preoperative purposes,

83
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,910
normal materials costing a few
hundred will do.

84
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,350
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

85
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,220
If you have any medical issues that

86
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,190
need to be communicated,

87
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,510
please feel free to contact me.

88
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,110
Xia Chu,

89
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,870
is it only medical
issues that I can ask?

90
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,740
I don't know about other questions.

91
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,230
And I have no time to answer that.

92
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,190
Are you still mad at me?

93
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,620
No.

94
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,060
That's it.

95
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,030
Zhuo Ran,

96
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,710
I am a resident.

97
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,180
My patients are

98
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,390
my first priority.

99
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,870
If it weren't for helping
my patients,

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,590
I wouldn't be standing here today

101
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,630
and have this conversation with you.

102
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,740
I want to spend my time
on the people and things

103
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,710
that are more meaningful to me.

104
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,230
Do you understand me?

105
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,750
With her attitude,

106
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,140
are you sure the plan
to approach Xia Guang Yuan

107
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,350
through her will work?

108
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,390
Xia Chu's attitude towards Zhuo Ran

109
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,830
would never change.

110
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,070
We just need time to rouse her.

111
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,550
I believe we can get what we need

112
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,790
through Xia Chu.

113
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,190
I hope so.

114
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,710
So far,

115
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,180
we can't identify

116
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,270
the male body in the villa.

117
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,790
We found an account

118
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,580
named Scary Pirate

119
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,390
in a confiscated laptop

120
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,020
but

121
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,590
it takes time to break the passcode.

122
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,630
So we can't confirm

123
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,190
whether this is related to

124
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,580
the founder who lurks in the drugs

125
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,550
trading platform.

126
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,750
Even if we break the passcode,

127
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,740
this can only mean that the person

128
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,980
logged into the account

129
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,830
named Scary Pirate in the villa.

130
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,660
It can't show who Scary Pirate is

131
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,150
or if he's related to that body.

132
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,070
This might be a
characteristic of a cybercrime.

133
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,980
Any progress on the

134
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,980
Jiao Tong University district case?

135
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,340
The name of the deceased is Zhou Lan,

136
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,580
22 years old,

137
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,910
born in Yibin, Sichuan.

138
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,070
She came here from
Chengdu three years ago.

139
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,100
She'd worked as a beverage promoter

140
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,510
in a club before.

141
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,550
She was later kept by

142
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,100
a man named Mr Bear.

143
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,430
After they broke up in March this year,

144
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,940
Mr Bear gave one of his properties

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,390
to the deceased,

146
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,750
which is the house where

147
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,950
the body was found
by the cleaning lady.

148
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,620
Has the autopsy report come out yet?

149
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,590
Yes.

150
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,870
According to the autopsy report,

151
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,110
basically, we can rule out
the possibility of homicide.

152
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,430
Zhou Lan's drowning

153
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,020
might be due to the
hallucination which was

154
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,510
caused by the consumption
of methamphetamine.

155
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,710
Where is the drugs' source?

156
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,259
We logged into an account

157
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,989
which she saved on the laptop.

158
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,660
We found that she had sent

159
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:43,749
a few posts requesting drugs in a

160
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,150
drug trading platform
called City of Desire.

161
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,550
How did a 20-year-old young lady

162
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,820
enter this

163
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,070
bottomless world?

164
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,270
Who is Mr Bear

165
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,390
exactly?

166
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,020
Hurry up! Keep going!

167
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,590
Hurry up!

168
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,870
Keep going! Keep going!

169
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,830
Hurry up! Keep going!

170
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,110
Hurry up! Keep going!

171
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,990
Hurry up! Run!

172
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,470
Hurry up! Run!

173
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,510
Hurry up! Keep going!

174
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,750
Hurry up! Run!

175
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,870
I'm a second faster
than your vice-captain.

176
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,270
Finish the remaining five kilometres.

177
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,550
Vice-captain,

178
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,670
are you an undercover
whom the captain sent here?

179
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,070
Are you a fun guy
whom the monkey sent here?

180
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,910
Wipe your drool.

181
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,030
Okay, stop hesitating!
Let's get started!

182
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,260
All tanks!

183
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,340
Five kilometres of trail running!

184
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,030
Double march!

185
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,710
Get your equipment.

186
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,830
I got it!

187
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,110
Brigade Commander.

188
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,310
In the last comprehensive assessment,

189
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,070
you set a new record
for Team Lightning.

190
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,190
Here's your citation.

191
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,550
Let's take a photo.

192
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,950
This isn't a first-class merit.

193
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,620
You're getting

194
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,860
greedy.

195
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,750
Even a field citation

196
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,110
can't satisfy you?

197
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,300
It was within our expectation.

198
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,510
We can get a better result

199
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,070
if Tian Yong hadn't cramped up.

200
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,420
Don't be proud!

201
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,740
Later on,

202
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,430
there will be a special combat training
for reserve officers.

203
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,510
By then,

204
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,110
all the experts will be here.

205
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,270
The more experts, the better.

206
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,340
It would be boring
if they were incompetent.

207
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm quite cool.

208
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,790
What's the point that
I think you're cool?

209
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,590
You have to make the
ladies think you're cool.

210
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,470
Silly boy.

211
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,630
When it comes to girls,

212
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,990
I've had only one problem

213
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,110
since childhood.

214
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,790
Too many ladies are coming for me.

215
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,470
Are you sure about that?

216
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,180
Then why did your mother

217
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,950
send me the photos?

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,630
What photos?

219
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,070
No, Mother, you're a

220
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,060
knowledgeable lady

221
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,900
who has been working for years, right?

222
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,220
Why did you become ignorant
and old-fashioned

223
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,710
when it comes to your child's marriage?

224
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,820
Not that I don't like it.

225
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,070
Just that it's too many.

226
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,870
I need to work too.

227
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,630
Mother?

228
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,630
Now she is mad.

229
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,820
Report!

230
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,790
Come in.

231
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,550
Captain,

232
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,990
Brigade Commander said...

233
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,510
Here it comes again.

234
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,270
What did he say?

235
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,310
Brigade Commander asked you to

236
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,510
drive me to the hospital
for a re-inspection

237
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,110
and to visit Xiao Jun.

238
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,030
Noted.

239
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,900
You can take some.

240
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,870
No, Captain.

241
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,260
-Why did you ask me to take it?
-Don't be shy.

242
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,140
-No!
-Take it!

243
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,420
I didn't see it, really!

244
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,750
-Take a pick!
-I really didn't see it!

245
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,550
Captain!

246
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,590
Keep it...

247
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,670
Captain, I'll go change my clothes!

248
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,310
He was staring at it.

249
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,150
Captain,

250
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,910
You're really ungrateful.

251
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,300
How I wish my parents

252
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,590
could arrange my marriage.

253
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,670
And you?

254
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,870
You don't appreciate it

255
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,220
and you even keep

256
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,830
yourself away from girls like a monk.

257
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,910
What's wrong with you?

258
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,110
I just don't like it.

259
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,240
What do you dislike?

260
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,230
There's always a stack of photos.

261
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,950
Looking at the photos,
having blind dates.

262
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,500
It's so old-fashioned.

263
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,340
Why don't you just say

264
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,780
you don't like any of the girls
in the photos?

265
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,310
What's all this for?

266
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,590
What isn't old-fashioned?

267
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,180
Among tens of thousands of people,

268
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,590
in the boundless river
spanning tens of thousands of years,

269
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,430
there's such thing as being too
early or too late.

270
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,820
What a coincidence! You met

271
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,750
the one you wish to meet.

272
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,230
You can only ask her discreetly,

273
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,820
"So you're here?"

274
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,070
Shut up!

275
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,630
Do you think this will work, Captain?

276
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,470
Stop talking.

277
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,020
According to the 3D printed heart model

278
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,230
of the patient,

279
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,870
ASD runs obliquely between the lower
part of the right superior and inferior

280
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,750
pulmonary vein and the superior
part of the inferior vena cava.

281
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,230
If we use APMLATZ
septal occluder on the

282
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,230
model to simulate the occlusion,

283
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:53,900
the right superior

284
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,430
and inferior pulmonary vein
will be obstructed,

285
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,670
which is the same problem
on the first surgery.

286
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,180
If we use a PDA occluder

287
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,500
to occlude it,

288
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,510
there'll be no obstruction on the right
superior and inferior pulmonary vein

289
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,990
making for a tight and secure seal.

290
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,030
Above is the result
of the surgical trial

291
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,750
according to the 3D printed heart model.

292
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,790
I've finished the debrief.

293
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,070
Thank you.

294
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,470
Xia Chu,

295
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,510
prepare for the surgery.

296
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,070
Yes.

297
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,270
We don't need to cut the heart open?

298
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes.

299
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,470
But I heard Dr Zhang said

300
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,670
it's hard to process
with interventional surgery.

301
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,830
Yes, it is.

302
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,260
That's why we need to duplicate

303
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,790
Xiao Jun's heart and simulate

304
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,510
the occlusion on the heart model

305
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,910
before the surgery.

306
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,630
Duplicating the heart,

307
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,750
does it really work?

308
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,940
Of course.

309
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,670
Conventional ultrasonic imaging
with CT imaging

310
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,300
and 3D data test mode,

311
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,030
these are the latest technologies.

312
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,430
Have there been any
successful cases before?

313
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,510
Why are you here?

314
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm with Tian Yong.
He's here for a re-inspection.

315
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,780
If this is the first attempt...

316
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,990
This is the first time
for our hospital.

317
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,740
But there's been successful cases

318
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,830
in other hospitals.

319
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,150
3D printing technology

320
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,990
can make a more
accurate surgical plan.

321
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,830
There are certain
risks in thoracotomy too.

322
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,180
As for the interventional surgery,

323
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,070
the damage it causes
is relatively minor.

324
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,550
Why don't you give it a try?

325
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,540
Trust her.

326
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,110
I'm in charge of tomorrow's operation.

327
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,950
You failed in the first operation.

328
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,300
Interventional surgery is

329
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,390
the field of cardiology.

330
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,830
Rest assured.

331
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,270
For a surgeon, an interventional surgery

332
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,870
is nothing new.

333
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,270
What about this?

334
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,830
It's more intuitive

335
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,070
with this.

336
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,630
What are you doing?

337
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,430
It's not our first time to kiss.

338
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,380
What are you doing?

339
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,540
Enough.

340
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,790
We've broken up for years.

341
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,470
Why did you do that?

342
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,380
Did you do that to

343
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,430
your resident too?

344
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,190
Which resident?

345
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,980
Xia Chu.

346
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,220
How is that possible?

347
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,460
You're ridiculous!

348
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,220
Let me tell you,

349
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,980
I've stayed away

350
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,910
from all my colleagues

351
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,030
since we broke up.

352
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,180
I knew

353
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,150
you'd regret

354
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,110
breaking up with me.

355
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,260
Why don't

356
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,310
we get back together?

357
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,110
Stop! Stop! What are you doing?

358
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,750
I don't...

359
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,190
Don't tell me

360
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,910
it's all because of an operation.

361
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,180
It's a huge operation
that might

362
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,110
break new grounds for clinical medicine.

363
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,140
Li Juan,

364
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,309
you haven't changed a bit

365
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,590
after all these years.

366
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,299
Have you changed?

367
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,510
I am responsible for my patient.

368
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,910
I thought you would
oppose this operation.

369
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,550
A doctor told me.

370
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,150
When a patient is
on the operating table,

371
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,630
the person who wishes for
his safety the most

372
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,390
is the doctor.

373
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,030
True.

374
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,630
Is the 3D printed heart model reliable?

375
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,150
It should be performed

376
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,470
by a cardiologist if it has to be done.

377
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,310
One more time.

378
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,190
This operation won't work.

379
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
Why not?

380
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,820
We've studied the patient's

381
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,350
3D printed heart model thoroughly

382
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,270
and the surgical plan
is well-established.

383
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,380
What remains is

384
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,950
seriousness and patience.

385
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,670
There will be no problems.

Zhang Yi Chi is going
to perform the repair of ASD.

388
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,470
Notify the anesthesiologist
and extracorporeal circulation

389
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,990
to prepare for the repair of ASD.

390
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,910
Yes, Dr Zhang.

391
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,710
Dr Zhang,

392
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,460
use model 26 PDA occluder.

393
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,350
We've tried it many times.

394
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,670
Its umbrella is more stable.

395
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,750
You can't go wrong.

396
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,030
Sir,

397
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,390
please don't give up.

398
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,470
Try it again.

399
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,110
Open model 26 PDA occluder.

400
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,350
Yes.

401
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,630
Dr Zhang.

402
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,070
Dr Zhang.

403
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,430
It's successful.

404
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,310
We had a little trouble while occluding

405
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,870
the ASD at first,

406
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,420
but then at her insistence,

407
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,740
we promptly

408
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,380
replaced it with a PDA occluder,

409
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,390
and it worked.

410
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,070
Thank you!

411
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,990
Thank you!

412
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,910
Thank you!

413
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,150
And Dr Xia.

414
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,150
Thank you very much!

415
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,390
You guys really

416
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,790
are angels, thank you.

417
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,510
Okay, you can rest assured now.

418
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,790
I have to drop by the emergency room.

419
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,100
Go on, you go on.

420
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,190
I'll get going.

421
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,310
Dr Xia

422
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,110
told you that, didn't she?

423
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,270
Yes.

424
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,630
You work this hard

425
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,190
just for an operation?

426
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,070
It's not about the operation,

427
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,830
it's for saving the patient.

428
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,270
Then how do you feel
about reclaiming the patient?

429
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,830
A patient is not a prize.

430
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,550
Don't use the word "claim."

431
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,950
I tell you what, Xia Chu.

432
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,180
Every resident in this hospital

433
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,750
wishes to take part in the surgery.

434
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,630
We work hard to show our strengths.

435
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,430
I finally got a chance

436
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,350
but you easily took it from me.

437
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,110
You took advantage of me.

438
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,790
I'm enough with your sweet-talk.

439
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,660
Do you know

440
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,980
how annoying you are?

441
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,380
Easily?

442
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,420
I only slept for

443
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,950
ten hours in seven days for this model.

444
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,540
I kept researching, practising
and recording data

445
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,380
during this period.

446
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,030
From the operation in the morning
to the handover,

447
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,990
I didn't even have time to eat.

448
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm so sleepy and hungry
I could vomit,

449
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,910
but I keep going, why?

450
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,190
Because someone told me

451
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,180
not to give up on

452
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,630
my patient until the last minute.

453
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,420
I made it.

454
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,750
Now, I'm really happy.

455
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,990
Your likes and dislikes

456
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,220
are meaningless to me.

457
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
I didn't come to this hospital

458
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,500
to please you.

459
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,260
Why are you here?

460
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,910
You haven't eaten, right?

461
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,180
Laoyou noodles, without spices.

462
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,310
Your favourite taste.

463
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,630
You don't have to be like this.

464
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,180
Did the surgery go well?

465
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,630
Yes.

466
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,910
The model is useful.

467
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,590
Thank you.

468
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,110
That's great.

469
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,060
Eat the noodles.

470
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,270
I'll leave first.

471
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,070
How are things going?

472
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,510
Xiao Jun hasn't come out yet.

473
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,670
I'm in the middle of something.

474
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,630
Dr Xia, you're awake.

475
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,030
Dr Xia, you've worked hard.

476
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,790
Can I help you?

477
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,670
Nothing.

478
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,990
Have you

479
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,630
found a place to stay?

480
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,270
I'm still searching.

481
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,750
I've been working overtime recently.

482
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,190
I have no time for it.

483
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,070
Then stop looking.
Just live in my house.

484
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,750
What?

485
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,710
Really?

486
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,830
Yes.

487
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,910
You're not that generous, Liang Mu Ze.

488
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,590
Yes.

489
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,140
There's a condition.

490
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,110
Okay.

491
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,150
You didn't even ask
what the condition is.

492
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,550
I'm fine with everything.

493
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,030
Nothing is more important
than one's life and death.

494
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,790
Okay then.

495
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,710
Date me.

496
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,710
What did you say?

497
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,110
Date me.

498
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,540
To handle my mother.

499
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,910
Just faking it.

500
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,110
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

501
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,830
How could we pretend to fall in love?

502
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,020
Definitely not.

503
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,380
Did you spread

504
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,710
the information about me having a son?

505
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,950
I...

506
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,790
I didn't mean to.

507
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,100
My mother forced me.

508
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,470
I had no choice.

509
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,190
She always tries to set us up.

510
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,500
If I don't get firm with her

511
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,630
and put a stop to it,

512
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,310
she'd never stop nagging me.

513
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,470
You did wipe it out of
your mother's mind.

514
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,740
But my mother is

515
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,020
dying to take girls to my unit.

516
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,550
What should I do?

517
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,190
Isn't that great?

518
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,150
No.

519
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,310
I really can't pretend to fall in love.

520
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,500
Moreover,

521
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,620
what if you really fall in love

522
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,430
with me?

523
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,670
Just worry about yourself.

524
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,470
Me? Why should I be worried?

525
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,350
I'll fall in love with you?

526
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,430
Are you kidding?

527
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,100
By your silence,

528
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,430
I assume you accept it.

529
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,910
I ate.

530
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,630
A dose of public display of affection.

531
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,310
Liang Mu Ze, don't be like this.

532
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,110
What if someone sees us?

533
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,870
You made me nervous.

534
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,430
Why are you so nervous, Dr Xia?

535
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,550
I...

536
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,230
I'm just shocked.

537
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,060
By the way,

538
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,150
why must you ask me

539
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,550
to trick your mother?

540
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,230
You live in my house.

541
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,910
And you refuse to help me?

542
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,670
It must be you.

543
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,510
Senior.

544
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,510
<i>Where are you?</i>

545
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,190
I'm in the hospital on
afternoon break.

546
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,390
<i>How about tomorrow?</i>

547
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,550
I have a night shift tomorrow.

548
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,110
What's wrong?
What's up?

549
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,830
<i>Professor Zhao of the
Military Medical University</i>

550
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,990
<i>had three consecutive
operations yesterday.</i>

551
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,740
<i>He died of acute myocardial
infarction on his way home.</i>

552
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,430
<i>Can you stop by?</i>

553
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,660
Okay.

554
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,110
Wait for me,
I'll be right over.

555
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,190
Deal?

556
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,590
What's wrong?

557
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,510
One of my professors
at the Military Medical University

558
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,390
died of acute myocardial infarction.

559
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,990
Where are you going?

560
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,710
To the airport.

561
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,140
I'll give you a ride.

562
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,310
I booked the 2 p.m. flight.

563
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,950
You don't have to pick me up.

564
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,110
Just send me the address.

565
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,230
I'll go there by myself.

566
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,260
Okay.

567
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,110
<i>Mr Zhang, I'm off.</i>

568
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,910
<i>Something's up, I'm
going back to my hometown.</i>

569
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,950
<i>I'll be back before
tomorrow's night shift.</i>

570
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,310
<i>Just a few days
before his retirement.</i>

571
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,020
His greatest wish

572
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,630
is to retire

573
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,590
to travel the world with his wife

574
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,900
to make up for the time

575
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,550
he's owed his family due to work.

576
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,510
Mrs Zhang is a high-school
geography teacher.

577
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,470
The farthest place they'd ever been to

578
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,430
was Yellow Mountain,
which they visited on their honeymoon.

579
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,550
Every time I go to Mr Zhang's house,

580
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,660
Mrs Zhang will take out

581
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,430
the photo and tell me

582
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,350
they would go to

583
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,540
Yellow Mountain again
after Mr Zhang retires

584
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,150
to see the clouds.

585
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,030
He's gone just like that.

586
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,350
Let's go.

587
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,670
I think it's stuck.

588
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,310
Let me take a look.

589
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,430
Done.

590
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,710
-Go.
-Thank you.

591
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,670
Do you have money?

592
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,630
I do.

593
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,910
Then

594
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,140
I'll get going.

595
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,150
Go.

596
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,820
About pretending to be your girlfriend,

597
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,310
I'll promise you

598
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,870
if it's a genuine need.

599
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,590
We'll talk about it when you're back.

600
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,740
Selling point!
It must have a selling point!

601
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,620
The reason why

602
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,030
the last issue became a hot topic...

603
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,350
3D printing company?

604
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,790
Mi Gu, what did you say?

605
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,710
Are you listening to me?

606
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm listening.

607
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,740
So

608
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,740
you think

609
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,150
it's in a 3D printing company?

610
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,580
This is my way of thinking

611
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,550
about this problem.

612
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,230
This is the power of modern technology.

613
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,700
Good.

614
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,830
We'll do this.

615
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,950
Leave it to me.

616
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,180
<i>Mi Gu, please cover</i>

617
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,860
<i>the topic of 3D printing for this issue</i>

618
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,590
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

619
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,470
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

620
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,670
<i>Hello, I am Mi Gu.</i>

621
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,990
<i>I'd like to meet up and</i>

622
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,500
<i>talk with you about 3D printing.</i>

623
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,550
<i>Are you free?</i>

624
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,790
<i>I'm sorry. The user you're calling</i>

625
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,350
<i>is not available.</i>

626
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,710
<i>Can you contact Zhuo Ran for me?</i>

627
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,030
<i>I'm looking for him.</i>

628
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,350
<i>I've met Mrs Zhang.</i>

629
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,750
<i>Everything is fine.</i>

630
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,350
<i>Thank you for giving me a ride.</i>

631
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,250
<i>Friend request</i>

632
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:20,300
<i>Special Forces: Accept</i>

633
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:44,890
<i>Set note and tag</i>

634
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,230
It's rare.

635
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,950
You proactively add a friend.

636
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,910
And it's a girl.

637
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,300
Can't I do that?

638
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,390
You can.

639
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,870
Is she extraordinary?

640
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,590
No.

641
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,230
But she is a doctor,
she saved Xiao Jun.

642
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,470
How long have you been living together?

643
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,510
Not even a ten-thousandth
of the time we've been together.

644
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,830
Well played.

645
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,430
Why do I feel that

646
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,670
you treat her differently?

647
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,260
What's the difference?

648
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,390
Look.

649
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,590
To send her to the airport,

650
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,310
you left me in the hospital

651
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,390
for so long.

652
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,710
You put off rejoining the unit

653
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,070
and

654
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,430
you have to take the risk of
being lectured by Brigade Commander.

655
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,150
Isn't the reason sufficient?

656
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,510
Isn't that obvious?

657
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,190
You're giving a reason

658
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,110
to scold you if you

659
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,270
don't drive faster.

660
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,550
Yes, sir!

661
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,750
It is hard to meet,
but hard to part too.

662
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,030
As the east wind wanes,
all the flowers fade.

663
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,470
Silkworms wonâ€™t stop spinning
silk till they die.

664
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,870
Sericulture is the new way to get rich.

665
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,470
Drive fast.

666
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,270
Xia, are you back?

667
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,060
I left the snow mushroom soup
on the table.

668
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,190
Drink it.

669
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,110
Miss Lan.

670
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,990
Girl, you're back. You scare me.

671
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,510
I thought it was your father.

672
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,150
Have you eaten?

673
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,380
I'll cook for you.

674
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,470
Never mind.

675
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,230
I've eaten.

676
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,310
You've eaten?

677
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,070
You didn't have your first meal
at home when you're back.

678
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,270
Where did you eat?

679
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,670
What did you eat?

680
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,070
Miss Lan,

681
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,310
I want to sleep with you tonight.

682
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,750
Silly girl,

683
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,030
you're past the age

684
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,790
to act like a baby.

685
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,390
Look at it.

686
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,070
How long since you've
cleaned your ear wax?

687
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,350
Don't move.

688
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,260
Home is the best, right?

689
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,870
Don't leave then.

690
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,150
No.

691
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,470
I still need to work.

692
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,630
You're

693
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,630
like your father.

694
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,990
You're a workaholic.

695
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,190
Has Father been busy recently?

696
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,230
Sure.

697
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,350
He's so busy that he's been gone
for three weeks.

698
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,230
Where did you two go

699
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,990
for your honeymoon?

700
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,310
No honeymoon.

701
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,270
Your father was summoned

702
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,430
by the research group the day
after our wedding.

703
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,670
Don't move!

704
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,990
Then you two must go on

705
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,110
a trip when father retires.

706
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,350
I'll pay for you.

707
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,750
You'll pay for us?

708
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,350
What can you do for us with your

709
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,350
starvation wage?

710
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,390
Just

711
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,910
take good care of yourself,

712
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,030
that would be enough for me.

713
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,550
I'm doing fine.

714
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,780
Right.

715
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,510
Why did you come back

716
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,670
all of a sudden?

717
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,190
Did someone bully you in the hospital?

718
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,830
No.

719
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,310
Were you not satisfied
with your new house?

720
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,590
No.

721
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,150
You've got a boyfriend?

722
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,670
Stop being ridiculous.

723
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,460
I'm sleepy, let's sleep.

724
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,420
You...

725
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,420
You stupid girl.

726
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,150
You always avoid me
when I talk about something important.

727
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,910
Avoid me, will you?

728
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,870
Why did you want to go that far?

729
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,430
I worry when you're away from home.

730
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,270
I worry when you're back home.

731
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,150
You think that I'm naggy

732
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,910
and you refuse to listen to me, don't you?

733
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,390
I can only worry by myself.

734
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,910
You'll know it one day.

735
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,540
You'll know it when
you become a mother.

736
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,470
That whether every mother
in the world is the same.

737
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,830
I'm fine.

738
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,100
I just missed you guys

739
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,230
and wanted to come home.

740
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,870
I shouldn't have

741
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,430
allowed you to study medicine.

742
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,230
You're right.

743
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,740
What's good to study medicine?

744
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,910
But I like it.

745
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,110
What should I do?

746
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,690
<i>Military University Professor died of
sudden heart attack due to overwork.</i>

747
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,390
I'm back!

748
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,870
Er Miao.

749
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,510
