<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,120
<i>Episode 5</i>

4
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,020
Have you seen Dr Zhang?

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,990
He's in the dressing room.

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,630
Thank you.

7
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,670
You're welcome.

8
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,470
Dr Zhang!

9
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,830
I'm changing,
what are you doing?

10
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,990
Sorry! Sorry!

11
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,630
She's killing me.
How reckless!

12
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,150
Xia Chu, how inappropriate!

13
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,910
Just carry on and listen to me.

14
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,260
We might be able to use

15
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,740
interventional surgery
for Xiao Jun's ASD

16
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,190
but only if we can find a method

17
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,630
that is more intuitive than a CT scan

18
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,870
for understanding the condition
of his ASD.

19
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,790
I tell you what.

20
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,620
The most intuitive way is

21
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,030
to cut the heart open,

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,350
and it's the most accurate way.

23
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,740
And a 3D printed heart model.

24
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,500
3D printed heart model?

25
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,790
Do not take photos!

26
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,870
I just want to show
you the previous case.

27
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,270
Someone has succeeded before.

28
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,670
You get out first.

29
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,750
Get out!

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,260
<i>Dressing room</i>

31
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,910
Keep that in mind.

32
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,020
It's the men's dressing room.

33
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,150
I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,910
I was in a hurry.

35
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,270
Then...

36
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,510
Where's the case?

37
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,070
Look.

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,660
This is his echocardiography

39
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,590
and this.

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,070
Okay.

41
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,829
It's possible.

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,180
But I haven't done it before.

43
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,070
I might need to
consult with a company.

44
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,030
I have a classmate
who's in this line of work.

45
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,710
Then hurry up and contact him.

46
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,430
Okay.

47
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,390
Xia Chu?

48
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,870
It's me.

49
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,430
I have something to talk to you.

50
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,660
<i>Go ahead.</i>

51
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,740
There's a kid with
congenital heart disease.

52
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,750
His first operation failed.

53
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,829
We need your 3D printing technology

54
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,470
to print his heart model out

55
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,310
before we perform the second surgery.

56
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,300
To get a full overview

57
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,950
of the location and type of his ASD

58
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,670
and to practice the surgery in advance.

59
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,500
You may wait in there.

60
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,710
Boss will be right here soon.

61
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,390
Thank you.

62
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,830
Do you know the
origin of this sketch?

63
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,950
September 7, 2011.

64
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,990
It was my first day
transferring to a new school.

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,909
During recess,

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,990
someone invited me to play shuttlecock.

67
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,620
I was hesitant.

68
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,110
It wasn't that I don't want to.

69
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:04,870
Just that I was drawing

70
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,060
a girl with a

71
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,630
beautiful smile at that moment.

72
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,910
Hello, Xia Chu.

73
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,660
The CT scans and the data of

74
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,830
echocardiography of
the patient are all in here.

75
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,230
How long does it take
to complete the production?

76
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,070
About one week if everything goes well.

77
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,030
How about the fee?

78
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,110
It depends on the material you choose.

79
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,230
Will the quality of the

80
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,630
materials affect the
accuracy of the final model?

81
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,590
It won't affect much.

82
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,070
For preoperative purposes,

83
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,710
normal materials costing a few
hundred will do.

84
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,150
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

85
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,020
If you have any medical issues that

86
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,990
need to be communicated,

87
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,310
please feel free to contact me.

88
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,910
Xia Chu,

89
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,670
is it only medical
issues that I can ask?

90
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,540
I don't know about other questions.

91
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,030
And I have no time to answer that.

92
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,990
Are you still mad at me?

93
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,420
No.

94
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,860
That's it.

95
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,830
Zhuo Ran,

96
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,510
I am a resident.

97
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,980
My patients are

98
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,190
my first priority.

99
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,670
If it weren't for helping
my patients,

100
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,390
I wouldn't be standing here today

101
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,430
and have this conversation with you.

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,540
I want to spend my time
on the people and things

103
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,510
that are more meaningful to me.

104
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,030
Do you understand me?

105
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,550
With her attitude,

106
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,940
are you sure the plan
to approach Xia Guang Yuan

107
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,150
through her will work?

108
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,190
Xia Chu's attitude towards Zhuo Ran

109
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,630
would never change.

110
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,870
We just need time to rouse her.

111
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,350
I believe we can get what we need

112
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,590
through Xia Chu.

113
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,990
I hope so.

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,510
So far,

115
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,980
we can't identify

116
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,070
the male body in the villa.

117
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,590
We found an account

118
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,380
named Scary Pirate

119
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,190
in a confiscated laptop

120
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,820
but

121
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,390
it takes time to break the passcode.

122
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,430
So we can't confirm

123
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,990
whether this is related to

124
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,380
the founder who lurks in the drugs

125
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,350
trading platform.

126
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,550
Even if we break the passcode,

127
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,540
this can only mean that the person

128
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,780
logged into the account

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,630
named Scary Pirate in the villa.

130
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,460
It can't show who Scary Pirate is

131
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,950
or if he's related to that body.

132
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,870
This might be a
characteristic of a cybercrime.

133
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,780
Any progress on the

134
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,780
Jiao Tong University district case?

135
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,140
The name of the deceased is Zhou Lan,

136
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,380
22 years old,

137
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,710
born in Yibin, Sichuan.

138
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,870
She came here from
Chengdu three years ago.

139
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,900
She'd worked as a beverage promoter

140
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,310
in a club before.

141
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,350
She was later kept by

142
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,900
a man named Mr Bear.

143
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,230
After they broke up in March this year,

144
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,740
Mr Bear gave one of his properties

145
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,190
to the deceased,

146
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,550
which is the house where

147
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,750
the body was found
by the cleaning lady.

148
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,420
Has the autopsy report come out yet?

149
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,390
Yes.

150
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,670
According to the autopsy report,

151
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,910
basically, we can rule out
the possibility of homicide.

152
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,230
Zhou Lan's drowning

153
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,820
might be due to the
hallucination which was

154
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,310
caused by the consumption
of methamphetamine.

155
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,510
Where is the drugs' source?

156
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,059
We logged into an account

157
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,789
which she saved on the laptop.

158
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,460
We found that she had sent

159
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,549
a few posts requesting drugs in a

160
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,950
drug trading platform
called City of Desire.

161
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,350
How did a 20-year-old young lady

162
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,620
enter this

163
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,870
bottomless world?

164
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,070
Who is Mr Bear

165
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,190
exactly?

166
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,820
Hurry up! Keep going!

167
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,390
Hurry up!

168
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,670
Keep going! Keep going!

169
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,630
Hurry up! Keep going!

170
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,910
Hurry up! Keep going!

171
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,790
Hurry up! Run!

172
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,270
Hurry up! Run!

173
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,310
Hurry up! Keep going!

174
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,550
Hurry up! Run!

175
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,670
I'm a second faster
than your vice-captain.

176
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,070
Finish the remaining five kilometres.

177
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,350
Vice-captain,

178
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,470
are you an undercover
whom the captain sent here?

179
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,870
Are you a fun guy
whom the monkey sent here?

180
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,710
Wipe your drool.

181
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,830
Okay, stop hesitating!
Let's get started!

182
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,060
All tanks!

183
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,140
Five kilometres of trail running!

184
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,830
Double march!

185
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,510
Get your equipment.

186
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,630
I got it!

187
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,910
Brigade Commander.

188
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,110
In the last comprehensive assessment,

189
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,870
you set a new record
for Team Lightning.

190
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,990
Here's your citation.

191
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,350
Let's take a photo.

192
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,750
This isn't a first-class merit.

193
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,420
You're getting

194
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,660
greedy.

195
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,550
Even a field citation

196
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,910
can't satisfy you?

197
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,100
It was within our expectation.

198
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,310
We can get a better result

199
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,870
if Tian Yong hadn't cramped up.

200
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,220
Don't be proud!

201
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,540
Later on,

202
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,230
there will be a special combat training
for reserve officers.

203
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,310
By then,

204
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,910
all the experts will be here.

205
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,070
The more experts, the better.

206
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,140
It would be boring
if they were incompetent.

207
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,710
I'm quite cool.

208
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,590
What's the point that
I think you're cool?

209
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,390
You have to make the
ladies think you're cool.

210
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,270
Silly boy.

211
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,430
When it comes to girls,

212
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,790
I've had only one problem

213
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
since childhood.

214
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,590
Too many ladies are coming for me.

215
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,270
Are you sure about that?

216
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,980
Then why did your mother

217
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,750
send me the photos?

218
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,430
What photos?

219
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,870
No, Mother, you're a

220
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,860
knowledgeable lady

221
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,700
who has been working for years, right?

222
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,020
Why did you become ignorant
and old-fashioned

223
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,510
when it comes to your child's marriage?

224
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,620
Not that I don't like it.

225
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,870
Just that it's too many.

226
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,670
I need to work too.

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,430
Mother?

228
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,430
Now she is mad.

229
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,620
Report!

230
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,590
Come in.

231
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,350
Captain,

232
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,790
Brigade Commander said...

233
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,310
Here it comes again.

234
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,070
What did he say?

235
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,110
Brigade Commander asked you to

236
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,310
drive me to the hospital
for a re-inspection

237
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,910
and to visit Xiao Jun.

238
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,830
Noted.

239
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,700
You can take some.

240
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,670
No, Captain.

241
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,060
-Why did you ask me to take it?
-Don't be shy.

242
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,940
-No!
-Take it!

243
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,220
I didn't see it, really!

244
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,550
-Take a pick!
-I really didn't see it!

245
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,350
Captain!

246
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,390
Keep it...

247
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,470
Captain, I'll go change my clothes!

248
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,110
He was staring at it.

249
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,950
Captain,

250
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,710
You're really ungrateful.

251
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,100
How I wish my parents

252
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,390
could arrange my marriage.

253
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,470
And you?

254
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,670
You don't appreciate it

255
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,020
and you even keep

256
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,630
yourself away from girls like a monk.

257
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,710
What's wrong with you?

258
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,910
I just don't like it.

259
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,040
What do you dislike?

260
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,030
There's always a stack of photos.

261
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,750
Looking at the photos,
having blind dates.

262
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,300
It's so old-fashioned.

263
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,140
Why don't you just say

264
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,580
you don't like any of the girls
in the photos?

265
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,110
What's all this for?

266
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,390
What isn't old-fashioned?

267
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,980
Among tens of thousands of people,

268
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,390
in the boundless river
spanning tens of thousands of years,

269
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,230
there's such thing as being too
early or too late.

270
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,620
What a coincidence! You met

271
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,550
the one you wish to meet.

272
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,030
You can only ask her discreetly,

273
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,620
"So you're here?"

274
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,870
Shut up!

275
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,430
Do you think this will work, Captain?

276
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,270
Stop talking.

277
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,820
According to the 3D printed heart model

278
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,030
of the patient,

279
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,670
ASD runs obliquely between the lower
part of the right superior and inferior

280
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,550
pulmonary vein and the superior
part of the inferior vena cava.

281
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,030
If we use APMLATZ
septal occluder on the

282
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,030
model to simulate the occlusion,

283
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,700
the right superior

284
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,230
and inferior pulmonary vein
will be obstructed,

285
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,470
which is the same problem
on the first surgery.

286
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,980
If we use a PDA occluder

287
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,300
to occlude it,

288
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,310
there'll be no obstruction on the right
superior and inferior pulmonary vein

289
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,790
making for a tight and secure seal.

290
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,830
Above is the result
of the surgical trial

291
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,550
according to the 3D printed heart model.

292
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,590
I've finished the debrief.

293
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,870
Thank you.

294
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,270
Xia Chu,

295
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,310
prepare for the surgery.

296
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,870
Yes.

297
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,070
We don't need to cut the heart open?

298
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,470
Yes.

299
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,270
But I heard Dr Zhang said

300
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,470
it's hard to process
with interventional surgery.

301
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,630
Yes, it is.

302
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,060
That's why we need to duplicate

303
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,590
Xiao Jun's heart and simulate

304
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,310
the occlusion on the heart model

305
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,710
before the surgery.

306
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,430
Duplicating the heart,

307
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,550
does it really work?

308
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,740
Of course.

309
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,470
Conventional ultrasonic imaging
with CT imaging

310
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,100
and 3D data test mode,

311
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,830
these are the latest technologies.

312
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,230
Have there been any
successful cases before?

313
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,310
Why are you here?

314
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,020
I'm with Tian Yong.
He's here for a re-inspection.

315
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,580
If this is the first attempt...

316
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,790
This is the first time
for our hospital.

317
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,540
But there's been successful cases

318
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,630
in other hospitals.

319
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,950
3D printing technology

320
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,790
can make a more
accurate surgical plan.

321
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,630
There are certain
risks in thoracotomy too.

322
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,980
As for the interventional surgery,

323
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,870
the damage it causes
is relatively minor.

324
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,350
Why don't you give it a try?

325
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,340
Trust her.

326
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,910
I'm in charge of tomorrow's operation.

327
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,750
You failed in the first operation.

328
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,100
Interventional surgery is

329
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,190
the field of cardiology.

330
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,630
Rest assured.

331
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,070
For a surgeon, an interventional surgery

332
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,670
is nothing new.

333
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,070
What about this?

334
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,630
It's more intuitive

335
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,870
with this.

336
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,430
What are you doing?

337
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,230
It's not our first time to kiss.

338
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,180
What are you doing?

339
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,340
Enough.

340
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,590
We've broken up for years.

341
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,270
Why did you do that?

342
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,180
Did you do that to

343
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,230
your resident too?

344
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,990
Which resident?

345
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,780
Xia Chu.

346
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,020
How is that possible?

347
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,260
You're ridiculous!

348
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,020
Let me tell you,

349
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,780
I've stayed away

350
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,710
from all my colleagues

351
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,830
since we broke up.

352
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,980
I knew

353
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,950
you'd regret

354
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,910
breaking up with me.

355
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,060
Why don't

356
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,110
we get back together?

357
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,910
Stop! Stop! What are you doing?

358
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,550
I don't...

359
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,990
Don't tell me

360
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,710
it's all because of an operation.

361
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,980
It's a huge operation
that might

362
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,910
break new grounds for clinical medicine.

363
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,940
Li Juan,

364
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,109
you haven't changed a bit

365
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,390
after all these years.

366
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,099
Have you changed?

367
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,310
I am responsible for my patient.

368
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,710
I thought you would
oppose this operation.

369
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,350
A doctor told me.

370
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,950
When a patient is
on the operating table,

371
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,430
the person who wishes for
his safety the most

372
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,190
is the doctor.

373
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,830
True.

374
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,430
Is the 3D printed heart model reliable?

375
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,950
It should be performed

376
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,270
by a cardiologist if it has to be done.

377
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,110
One more time.

378
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,990
This operation won't work.

379
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,580
Why not?

380
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,620
We've studied the patient's

381
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,150
3D printed heart model thoroughly

382
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,070
and the surgical plan
is well-established.

383
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,180
What remains is

384
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,750
seriousness and patience.

385
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,470
There will be no problems.

Zhang Yi Chi is going
to perform the repair of ASD.

388
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,270
Notify the anesthesiologist
and extracorporeal circulation

389
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,790
to prepare for the repair of ASD.

390
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,710
Yes, Dr Zhang.

391
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,510
Dr Zhang,

392
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,260
use model 26 PDA occluder.

393
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,150
We've tried it many times.

394
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,470
Its umbrella is more stable.

395
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,550
You can't go wrong.

396
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,830
Sir,

397
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,190
please don't give up.

398
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,270
Try it again.

399
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,910
Open model 26 PDA occluder.

400
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,150
Yes.

401
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,430
Dr Zhang.

402
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,870
Dr Zhang.

403
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,230
It's successful.

404
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,110
We had a little trouble while occluding

405
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,670
the ASD at first,

406
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,220
but then at her insistence,

407
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,540
we promptly

408
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,180
replaced it with a PDA occluder,

409
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,190
and it worked.

410
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,870
Thank you!

411
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,790
Thank you!

412
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,710
Thank you!

413
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,950
And Dr Xia.

414
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,950
Thank you very much!

415
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,190
You guys really

416
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,590
are angels, thank you.

417
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,310
Okay, you can rest assured now.

418
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,590
I have to drop by the emergency room.

419
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,900
Go on, you go on.

420
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,990
I'll get going.

421
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,110
Dr Xia

422
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,910
told you that, didn't she?

423
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,070
Yes.

424
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,430
You work this hard

425
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,990
just for an operation?

426
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,870
It's not about the operation,

427
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,630
it's for saving the patient.

428
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,070
Then how do you feel
about reclaiming the patient?

429
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,630
A patient is not a prize.

430
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,350
Don't use the word "claim."

431
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,750
I tell you what, Xia Chu.

432
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,980
Every resident in this hospital

433
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,550
wishes to take part in the surgery.

434
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,430
We work hard to show our strengths.

435
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,230
I finally got a chance

436
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,150
but you easily took it from me.

437
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,910
You took advantage of me.

438
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,590
I'm enough with your sweet-talk.

439
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,460
Do you know

440
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,780
how annoying you are?

441
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,180
Easily?

442
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,220
I only slept for

443
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,750
ten hours in seven days for this model.

444
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,340
I kept researching, practising
and recording data

445
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,180
during this period.

446
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,830
From the operation in the morning
to the handover,

447
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,790
I didn't even have time to eat.

448
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm so sleepy and hungry
I could vomit,

449
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,710
but I keep going, why?

450
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,990
Because someone told me

451
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,980
not to give up on

452
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,430
my patient until the last minute.

453
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,220
I made it.

454
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,550
Now, I'm really happy.

455
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,790
Your likes and dislikes

456
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,020
are meaningless to me.

457
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,940
I didn't come to this hospital

458
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,300
to please you.

459
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,060
Why are you here?

460
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,710
You haven't eaten, right?

461
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,980
Laoyou noodles, without spices.

462
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,110
Your favourite taste.

463
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,430
You don't have to be like this.

464
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,980
Did the surgery go well?

465
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,430
Yes.

466
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,710
The model is useful.

467
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,390
Thank you.

468
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,910
That's great.

469
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,860
Eat the noodles.

470
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,070
I'll leave first.

471
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,870
How are things going?

472
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,310
Xiao Jun hasn't come out yet.

473
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,470
I'm in the middle of something.

474
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,430
Dr Xia, you're awake.

475
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,830
Dr Xia, you've worked hard.

476
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,590
Can I help you?

477
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,470
Nothing.

478
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,790
Have you

479
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,430
found a place to stay?

480
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,070
I'm still searching.

481
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,550
I've been working overtime recently.

482
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,990
I have no time for it.

483
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,870
Then stop looking.
Just live in my house.

484
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,550
What?

485
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,510
Really?

486
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,630
Yes.

487
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,710
You're not that generous, Liang Mu Ze.

488
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,390
Yes.

489
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,940
There's a condition.

490
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,910
Okay.

491
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,950
You didn't even ask
what the condition is.

492
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,350
I'm fine with everything.

493
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,830
Nothing is more important
than one's life and death.

494
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,590
Okay then.

495
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,510
Date me.

496
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,510
What did you say?

497
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,910
Date me.

498
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,340
To handle my mother.

499
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,710
Just faking it.

500
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,910
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

501
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,630
How could we pretend to fall in love?

502
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,820
Definitely not.

503
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,180
Did you spread

504
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,510
the information about me having a son?

505
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,750
I...

506
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,590
I didn't mean to.

507
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,900
My mother forced me.

508
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,270
I had no choice.

509
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,990
She always tries to set us up.

510
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,300
If I don't get firm with her

511
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,430
and put a stop to it,

512
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,110
she'd never stop nagging me.

513
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,270
You did wipe it out of
your mother's mind.

514
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,540
But my mother is

515
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,820
dying to take girls to my unit.

516
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,350
What should I do?

517
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,990
Isn't that great?

518
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,950
No.

519
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,110
I really can't pretend to fall in love.

520
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,300
Moreover,

521
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,420
what if you really fall in love

522
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,230
with me?

523
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,470
Just worry about yourself.

524
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,270
Me? Why should I be worried?

525
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,150
I'll fall in love with you?

526
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,230
Are you kidding?

527
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,900
By your silence,

528
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,230
I assume you accept it.

529
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,710
I ate.

530
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,430
A dose of public display of affection.

531
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,110
Liang Mu Ze, don't be like this.

532
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,910
What if someone sees us?

533
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,670
You made me nervous.

534
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,230
Why are you so nervous, Dr Xia?

535
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,350
I...

536
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,030
I'm just shocked.

537
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,860
By the way,

538
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,950
why must you ask me

539
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,350
to trick your mother?

540
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,030
You live in my house.

541
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,710
And you refuse to help me?

542
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,470
It must be you.

543
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,310
Senior.

544
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,310
<i>Where are you?</i>

545
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,990
I'm in the hospital on
afternoon break.

546
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,190
<i>How about tomorrow?</i>

547
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,350
I have a night shift tomorrow.

548
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,910
What's wrong?
What's up?

549
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,630
<i>Professor Zhao of the
Military Medical University</i>

550
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,790
<i>had three consecutive
operations yesterday.</i>

551
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,540
<i>He died of acute myocardial
infarction on his way home.</i>

552
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,230
<i>Can you stop by?</i>

553
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,460
Okay.

554
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,910
Wait for me,
I'll be right over.

555
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,990
Deal?

556
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,390
What's wrong?

557
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,310
One of my professors
at the Military Medical University

558
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,190
died of acute myocardial infarction.

559
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,790
Where are you going?

560
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,510
To the airport.

561
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,940
I'll give you a ride.

562
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,110
I booked the 2 p.m. flight.

563
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,750
You don't have to pick me up.

564
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,910
Just send me the address.

565
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,030
I'll go there by myself.

566
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,060
Okay.

567
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,910
<i>Mr Zhang, I'm off.</i>

568
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,710
<i>Something's up, I'm
going back to my hometown.</i>

569
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,750
<i>I'll be back before
tomorrow's night shift.</i>

570
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,110
<i>Just a few days
before his retirement.</i>

571
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,820
His greatest wish

572
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,430
is to retire

573
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,390
to travel the world with his wife

574
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,700
to make up for the time

575
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,350
he's owed his family due to work.

576
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,310
Mrs Zhang is a high-school
geography teacher.

577
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,270
The farthest place they'd ever been to

578
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,230
was Yellow Mountain,
which they visited on their honeymoon.

579
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,350
Every time I go to Mr Zhang's house,

580
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,460
Mrs Zhang will take out

581
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,230
the photo and tell me

582
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,150
they would go to

583
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,340
Yellow Mountain again
after Mr Zhang retires

584
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,950
to see the clouds.

585
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,830
He's gone just like that.

586
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,150
Let's go.

587
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,470
I think it's stuck.

588
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,110
Let me take a look.

589
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,230
Done.

590
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,510
-Go.
-Thank you.

591
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,470
Do you have money?

592
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,430
I do.

593
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,710
Then

594
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,940
I'll get going.

595
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,950
Go.

596
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,620
About pretending to be your girlfriend,

597
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,110
I'll promise you

598
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,670
if it's a genuine need.

599
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,390
We'll talk about it when you're back.

600
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,540
Selling point!
It must have a selling point!

601
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,420
The reason why

602
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,830
the last issue became a hot topic...

603
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,150
3D printing company?

604
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,590
Mi Gu, what did you say?

605
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,510
Are you listening to me?

606
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm listening.

607
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,540
So

608
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,540
you think

609
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,950
it's in a 3D printing company?

610
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,380
This is my way of thinking

611
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,350
about this problem.

612
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,030
This is the power of modern technology.

613
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,500
Good.

614
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,630
We'll do this.

615
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,750
Leave it to me.

616
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,980
<i>Mi Gu, please cover</i>

617
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,660
<i>the topic of 3D printing for this issue</i>

618
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,390
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

619
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,270
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

620
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,470
<i>Hello, I am Mi Gu.</i>

621
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,790
<i>I'd like to meet up and</i>

622
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,300
<i>talk with you about 3D printing.</i>

623
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,350
<i>Are you free?</i>

624
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,590
<i>I'm sorry. The user you're calling</i>

625
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,150
<i>is not available.</i>

626
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,510
<i>Can you contact Zhuo Ran for me?</i>

627
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,830
<i>I'm looking for him.</i>

628
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,150
<i>I've met Mrs Zhang.</i>

629
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
<i>Everything is fine.</i>

630
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,150
<i>Thank you for giving me a ride.</i>

631
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,050
<i>Friend request</i>

632
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:20,100
<i>Special Forces: Accept</i>

633
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,690
<i>Set note and tag</i>

634
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,030
It's rare.

635
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,750
You proactively add a friend.

636
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,710
And it's a girl.

637
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,100
Can't I do that?

638
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,190
You can.

639
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,670
Is she extraordinary?

640
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,390
No.

641
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,030
But she is a doctor,
she saved Xiao Jun.

642
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,270
How long have you been living together?

643
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,310
Not even a ten-thousandth
of the time we've been together.

644
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,630
Well played.

645
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,230
Why do I feel that

646
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,470
you treat her differently?

647
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,060
What's the difference?

648
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,190
Look.

649
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,390
To send her to the airport,

650
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,110
you left me in the hospital

651
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,190
for so long.

652
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,510
You put off rejoining the unit

653
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:27,870
and

654
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,230
you have to take the risk of
being lectured by Brigade Commander.

655
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,950
Isn't the reason sufficient?

656
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,310
Isn't that obvious?

657
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,990
You're giving a reason

658
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,910
to scold you if you

659
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,070
don't drive faster.

660
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,350
Yes, sir!

661
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,550
It is hard to meet,
but hard to part too.

662
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,830
As the east wind wanes,
all the flowers fade.

663
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,270
Silkworms wonâ€™t stop spinning
silk till they die.

664
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,670
Sericulture is the new way to get rich.

665
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,270
Drive fast.

666
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,070
Xia, are you back?

667
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,860
I left the snow mushroom soup
on the table.

668
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,990
Drink it.

669
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,910
Miss Lan.

670
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,790
Girl, you're back. You scare me.

671
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,310
I thought it was your father.

672
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,950
Have you eaten?

673
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,180
I'll cook for you.

674
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,270
Never mind.

675
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,030
I've eaten.

676
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,110
You've eaten?

677
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,870
You didn't have your first meal
at home when you're back.

678
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,070
Where did you eat?

679
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,470
What did you eat?

680
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,870
Miss Lan,

681
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,110
I want to sleep with you tonight.

682
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,550
Silly girl,

683
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,830
you're past the age

684
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,590
to act like a baby.

685
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,190
Look at it.

686
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,870
How long since you've
cleaned your ear wax?

687
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,150
Don't move.

688
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,060
Home is the best, right?

689
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,670
Don't leave then.

690
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,950
No.

691
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,270
I still need to work.

692
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,430
You're

693
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,430
like your father.

694
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,790
You're a workaholic.

695
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,990
Has Father been busy recently?

696
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,030
Sure.

697
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,150
He's so busy that he's been gone
for three weeks.

698
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,030
Where did you two go

699
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,790
for your honeymoon?

700
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,110
No honeymoon.

701
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,070
Your father was summoned

702
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,230
by the research group the day
after our wedding.

703
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,470
Don't move!

704
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,790
Then you two must go on

705
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,910
a trip when father retires.

706
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,150
I'll pay for you.

707
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,550
You'll pay for us?

708
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,150
What can you do for us with your

709
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,150
starvation wage?

710
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,190
Just

711
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,710
take good care of yourself,

712
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,830
that would be enough for me.

713
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,350
I'm doing fine.

714
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,580
Right.

715
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,310
Why did you come back

716
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,470
all of a sudden?

717
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,990
Did someone bully you in the hospital?

718
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,630
No.

719
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,110
Were you not satisfied
with your new house?

720
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,390
No.

721
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,950
You've got a boyfriend?

722
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,470
Stop being ridiculous.

723
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,260
I'm sleepy, let's sleep.

724
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,220
You...

725
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,220
You stupid girl.

726
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,950
You always avoid me
when I talk about something important.

727
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,710
Avoid me, will you?

728
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,670
Why did you want to go that far?

729
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,230
I worry when you're away from home.

730
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,070
I worry when you're back home.

731
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,950
You think that I'm naggy

732
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,710
and you refuse to listen to me, don't you?

733
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,190
I can only worry by myself.

734
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,710
You'll know it one day.

735
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,340
You'll know it when
you become a mother.

736
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,270
That whether every mother
in the world is the same.

737
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,630
I'm fine.

738
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,900
I just missed you guys

739
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,030
and wanted to come home.

740
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,670
I shouldn't have

741
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,230
allowed you to study medicine.

742
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,030
You're right.

743
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,540
What's good to study medicine?

744
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,710
But I like it.

745
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,910
What should I do?

746
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,490
<i>Military University Professor died of
sudden heart attack due to overwork.</i>

747
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,190
I'm back!

748
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,670
Er Miao.

749
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,310
