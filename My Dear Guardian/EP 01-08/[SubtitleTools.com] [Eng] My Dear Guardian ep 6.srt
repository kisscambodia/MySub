<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,340
<i>Episode 6</i>

4
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,830
Sure.

5
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
Thank you.

6
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,479
How is it?

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,180
<i>Zhuo Ran</i>

8
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,310
I cooked seafood porridge.

9
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,400
I'll turn off the heat
if you don't want to eat.

10
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,520
It's to save electricity.

11
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,430
Bring me some.

12
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,040
Such a brat!

13
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,120
"Bring me some."

14
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,350
Isn't that my book?

15
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,550
This is my house.

16
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,030
Did you prepare steamed bun?

17
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,230
No.

18
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,410
I've homemade whole grain pancakes though.

19
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,710
Do you want to try?

20
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,950
Bring it here.

21
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,590
It smells wonderful. I want to try it too!

22
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,480
It's quite delicious.

23
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,960
Of course.

24
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,230
It would go well with pickles.

25
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,290
Liang Mu Ze.

26
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,600
Have of you heard of a story before?

27
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,920
Long, long time ago, a man

28
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,090
kept bossing his housemate

29
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,670
who was a doctor around.

30
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,829
Finally, one day,

31
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,630
his housemate poisoned him to death

32
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,590
without anyone knowing.

33
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,950
Haven't you heard that story before?

34
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,150
I've heard about a story.

35
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,910
It's about a Special Forces soldier

36
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,670
who was poisoned to death.

37
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,370
Three seconds
before the poison came into effect,

38
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,930
he punched the person
who poisoned him to death.

39
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,159
Have you heard of the story?

40
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,210
What a coward.

41
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,750
Thank you.

42
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,710
The book is nice, isn't it?

43
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,630
Can you guess who the murderer is?

44
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,720
It's not Umeda Hachiro for sure.

45
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,150
It's not him for sure.

46
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,200
The story is like this.

47
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,390
Let me tell you.

48
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,640
In the end,

49
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,000
Mitarai was the one
who resolved

50
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,270
the Tokyo Zodiac Murders.

51
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,510
Isn't it interesting?

52
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,250
I have many detective novels on the shelf.

53
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,790
I can tell you the ending one by one.

54
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,510
Do you know what is

55
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,500
the most miserable thing in life?

56
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,210
Not having any canned food.

57
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,810
Misery is when you're reading the climax

58
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,200
of a detective novel,

59
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,320
someone breaks the ending to you
without warning.

60
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,610
Is detective novel
tastier than canned food?

61
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,670
I bet Liang Mu Ze

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,310
is as upset as
having constipation for five days.

63
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,270
He deserves it.

64
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,210
He was lazying in the sofa
like a braised egg

65
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,890
and bossing me around
as if I was his babysitter.

66
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,870
Let me tell you.

67
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,990
This is just a warning.

68
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,950
If he does that to me again,

69
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,270
You better shut up now.

70
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,230
I'll...

71
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,740
Have you finished taking a shower?

72
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,110
Hug me, handsome.

73
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,700
Do you want some tea?

74
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,670
Yes.

75
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,120
Sure.

76
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,280
Here you go.

77
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,470
Please try it.

78
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,280
What's that smell?

79
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,700
What's wrong?

80
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,350
Take it away.

81
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,909
Did you just bring my toilet bowl here?

82
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,210
Take it away.

83
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,690
Are you scared of durian?

84
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm not scared of it. I don't like it.

85
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,590
So you're scared of it.

86
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,070
Take it away!

87
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,450
Sure. Don't be scared.

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,260
Here.

89
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,240
Drink some tea to calm down.

90
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,530
Here.

91
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,560
I'll finish all of it.

92
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,270
Are you done?

93
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,220
Liang Mu Ze, you're so sensitive.

94
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't go.

95
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,090
I'm just joking.

96
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,210
Take it away!

97
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,550
It's not easy to brew the tea.

98
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,680
At least take a sip. Don't waste it.

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,780
It's either I leave or you take it away.

100
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,680
I'll take it away.

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,860
I'll get lost.

102
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,800
Is it nice?

103
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,960
Is this Pre-Qingming Longjing?

104
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,560
Suitable for kids.

105
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,760
You know about tea too?

106
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,970
So what?

107
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,250
I swear I'm not secretly thinking that
you're old-fashioned.

108
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,670
My grandma loves drinking tea.

109
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,170
When I was young,
I always had Longjing, Pu'er

110
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,800
with her.

111
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,560
I see.

112
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,960
When you go back to
your hometown next time,

113
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,320
I'll prepare some tea leaves for you

114
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,350
so that you can bring it back
for your grandma.

115
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,570
No need.

116
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,110
Don't be shy.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,730
Before I left, I had stolen
quite a bit of tea leaves

118
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,080
from my dad's tea cabinet.

119
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,590
My home is near to Hangzhou.

120
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,850
I have quite many opportunities
to taste Longjing every year.

121
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,140
No matter how expensive tea is,

122
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,800
it is meant to be tasted by people.

123
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,970
Its value will only be reflected

124
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,240
when more people try it.

125
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,830
Don't feel sorry for me.

126
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,610
No need.

127
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,260
Don't be shy.

128
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,050
My grandma passed away long time ago.

129
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,310
My grandma passed away long time ago too.

130
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,950
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
I didn't know that.

132
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,190
My bed is not covered with bed sheets.

133
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,810
If you feel sorry for me,

134
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,670
lend me a bed sheet
and make the bed for me.

135
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,280
Sure, I'll do it.

136
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,340
Something is not right.

137
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,350
Why should I feel sorry for him?

138
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,370
He mentioned his grandma first.

139
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,640
I didn't know that.

140
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,810
Why should I contribute my bed sheet?

141
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,990
Why should I make his bed?

142
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,390
Who does he think he is?

143
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,230
He is your landlord.

144
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,550
It's either you put up with him
or you leave.

145
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,350
Make the bed for him, huh?

146
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,470
Sad story, huh?

147
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,710
Fine, let's make his wish come true.

148
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,360
I've a bad hunch.

149
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,820
And in the name of the Moon,
I will punish you!

150
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,240
Liang Mu Ze.

151
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,620
Poop-picker, wake up! You're getting late.

152
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,170
I'm going to be late.

153
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,590
Will you stop staring at me?

154
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm sorry. I came to the wrong place.

155
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm doomed.

156
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,210
I'm leaving.

157
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,360
Finish it before you leave.

158
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,010
Thank you.

159
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,020
Did you go out to get milk
early in the morning?

160
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,320
I didn't buy it.

161
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,710
You left it in the fridge.

162
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,540
You got it from the fridge?
I didn't keep milk in the fridge.

163
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,700
It's here.

164
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,630
Why did you give it to me?

165
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,400
It's not expired. I've checked.

166
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,090
It's whipping cream.

167
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,200
Do you know

168
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,950
how many calories it contains?

169
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,010
I have no idea.

170
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,370
Why did you give it to me then?

171
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,680
You kind of enjoyed it.

172
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,160
-Liang Mu Ze!
-You're going to be late.

173
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,340
What did you say?

174
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,650
Forget it. I'll get another driver.

175
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,930
It's okay.

176
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,900
Are you having motion sickness?

177
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,760
It's gut fermentation syndrome.

178
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,950
I feel like vomiting.

179
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,190
It's okay.

180
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,480
Just put up with it.

181
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,480
It's not a serious problem.

182
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,640
Don't be dramatic.

183
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,310
You need to be strong.

184
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
Liang Mu Ze, you said that on purpose.

185
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,180
You're thinking too much.

186
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,890
I'm just an old hog.

187
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,590
I can't tell

188
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,530
whipping cream and milk apart.

189
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,750
They're the same to me.

190
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,730
You're talking nonsense!

191
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,720
You're angry at me

192
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,050
as I made your bed
with a printed Sailor Moon bedding set.

193
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,240
You're seeking revenge.

194
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,160
Listen.

195
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,280
You're a special forces soldier

196
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,710
and yet you're so petty.

197
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,240
For a man like you,

198
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,210
let alone insomnia,

199
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,160
you may drop dead one day soon.

200
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,150
Who is the petty one?

201
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,130
It's you.

202
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,990
We're here.

203
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,840
Good morning, Xia Chu.

204
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,190
Good morning.

205
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,440
He's my comrade.

206
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,790
Will you get down now?

207
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,590
Why are you here?

208
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,230
I'm here for something.

209
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,660
Have you eaten breakfast?

210
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,890
Yes, I've eaten.

211
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,840
Keep it for lunch.

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,960
What's wrong?

213
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,880
Take it away.
I can't look at it the same way anymore.

214
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,550
This is my comrade.

215
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,090
Find out someone for me.

216
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,560
It's one week after the patient,
Luo Xiao Jun underwent the surgery.

217
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,670
It's time for the review
of heart ultrasonography.

218
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,390
There's no blood clot on septal occluder.

219
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,250
The reading of blood cell count
and coagulation index are normal.

220
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,750
No active bleeding is found.

221
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,900
The drainage tube was removed last night.

222
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,660
That's great.

223
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,000
Dr Zhang

224
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,110
has completed yet another challenge.

225
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,150
The coagulation during the intervention

226
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,800
and the bleeding management
during thoracotomy

227
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,240
were managed well.

228
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,600
I don't deserve all the credit.

229
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,090
Thanks to Xia Chu.

230
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,070
All right. Xia Chu should
come out with a case report.

231
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,550
She's pregnant!

232
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm not pregnant.

233
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,210
You're pregnant.

234
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,790
You almost puked.

235
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,020
So what?

236
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,650
That's the sign of pregnancy.

237
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,780
Xiao Jun, don't talk nonsense.

238
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,630
It's always shown on TV.

239
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,060
Stop talking.

240
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,480
Why are you laughing?

241
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,310
Yang Mu Ze is such a jerk!

242
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,660
If it ever happens again,

243
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,450
I'll poison you to death!

244
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,930
The military medical doctor

245
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,810
needs to attend to something urgent.

246
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,610
They need our help.

247
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,720
Get ready.

248
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,900
Why is it me?

249
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,290
As Mr Zhang said,

250
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,110
we need to send a houseman there.

251
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,200
You're not in.

252
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,140
All of us

253
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,450
unanimously recommended you
as the representative.

254
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,380
Are you really pregnant?

255
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,400
If you admit that you studied eight years
in medical school for nothing,

256
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,880
I'll admit that I'm pregnant.

257
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,870
Are you pregnant
and he refuses to be responsible?

258
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,430
Isn't that the storyline?

259
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,400
Who refuses to be responsible?
What nonsense are you talking about?

260
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,710
That military officer.

261
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,360
If not so,
why would you poison him to death?

262
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,110
That's between him and me.

263
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,770
All right. I got it.

264
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,890
Go now.

265
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,880
The success of the surgery

266
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,320
has further strengthened our determination

267
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,650
to develop and produce

268
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,190
3D technology.

269
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,720
I hope we can start from
the department of cardiothoracic surgery.

270
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,010
We shall work together

271
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,250
to set up a special fund

272
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,750
for 3D Printing and hologram technology

273
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,160
which is non-profit making.

274
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,170
It's to expedite

275
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,310
the development of 3D technology.

276
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,360
From my personal view,

277
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,870
clinical technology innovation

278
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,030
is definitely a good movement.

279
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,280
We welcome such exploration.

280
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
However, as for the hospital,

281
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,840
we need further discussion on it.

282
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,310
We can do it.

283
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,600
However, as for the mode of operation

284
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,990
of the special fund,

285
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,680
we need further clarification.

286
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,970
Don't worry. I'll draft a

287
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,380
Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement
as soon as possible

288
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,680
and explain to all of you in detail.

289
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,370
That's great.

290
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,790
We'll wait for the good news, Mr Zhuo.

291
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,840
Dr Zhang.

292
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,760
Thank you for making the contact.

293
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,950
Sorry to have troubled you.

294
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,150
Don't worry.

295
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,950
Not to mention you're Xia Chu's friend.

296
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,960
Personalized medicine

297
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,420
is the trend.

298
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,110
3D printing technology

299
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,810
is an important element.

300
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,060
If the special fund

301
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,840
can go through smoothly,

302
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,950
I think

303
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,600
it's beneficial to everyone

304
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,270
be it your company,

305
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,260
our hospital and department

306
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,780
or our potential patients.

307
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,010
It's a win-win situation.

308
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,310
It's worth doing.

309
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,040
Do you have time for lunch?

310
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
I would like to treat you

311
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,790
and Xia Chu a meal.

312
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,200
I need to conduct a surgery
in the afternoon.

313
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,630
Furthermore, Xia Chu hasn't come back yet.

314
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,850
Where did she go?

315
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,230
She's gone to the military camp
for health security tasks.

316
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,790
Are you looking for her?

317
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,880
<i>It's such a hot day</i>

318
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,850
yet you guys have to work under hot sun.

319
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,990
Thank you for the hard work.

320
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,870
It's our duty.

321
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,440
It's mainly because

322
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,350
casualties have increased lately.

323
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,170
Not only do I have to manage equipment
and medicine supply alone,

324
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,480
I also have to take care of the patients.

325
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,870
I'm really up to my neck.

326
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,470
What are they doing?

327
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,590
Have you heard about
The Heavenly Maid Scatters Blossoms?

328
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,250
It's time for you to see new things.

329
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,240
Liang Mu Ze, can you do it?

330
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,100
He's Liang Mu Ze
of Special Forces Brigade.

331
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,270
His marksmanship

332
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,890
was made known in the division
during the training.

333
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,600
Some people call him

334
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,020
the God of Guns.

335
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,430
God?

336
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,730
He's just mental.

337
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,470
Get ready to shoot.

<i>Treatment Room</i>

341
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,420
The wound is not too bad.
No stitches are needed.

342
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,040
Stop moving!

343
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,300
It's too big.

344
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,650
What?

345
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,840
The plaster is too big.

346
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,900
It's not nice looking.

347
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,520
Everyone looks ugly when they're injured.

348
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,360
Don't bolster yourself
if you want to look good.

349
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,330
Why did you fool around for no reason?

350
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,520
Do you really think that
I was fooling around?

351
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,660
Weren't you?

352
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,490
You shot down cans of beer in a row.

353
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,230
No doubt it's interesting to watch

354
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,130
but what can the tricks do

355
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,200
when it comes to actual battle?

356
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,760
A few years back,

357
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,800
there was a kidnapping case.

358
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,310
The Special Forces
had to assist the SWAT

359
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,690
in rescuing the hostages.

360
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,850
However, the kidnappers

361
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,270
threw a gas tank right off the roof.

362
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,600
Fortunately, an officer found out about it

363
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,120
and shot the gas tank with a gun.

364
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,900
The gas tank exploded in the air.

365
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,940
Not only did he save himself,

366
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,530
he also saved the hostages.

367
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,560
He also saved the onlooking crowd.

368
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,250
You're right.

369
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,390
It's not practical in war.

370
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,200
However, in a battlefield,

371
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,640
one will encounter more violent situations
with blood and gore.

372
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,030
Those situations can only be handled by

373
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,680
these unusual training.

374
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,840
It's done.

375
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,990
Where is the sink?

376
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,320
It's next door.

377
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,920
Thank you.

378
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,060
By the way,

379
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,730
take care of the wound hygiene.

380
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,970
Rest well.

381
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,890
-Keep the wound dry.
-Sure.

382
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,620
The kidnapping case that you mentioned

383
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,810
sounded dangerous.

384
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,450
Did you experience it on your own

385
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,760
or did you hear it from someone?

386
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,590
I made up the incident.

387
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,790
I just wanted to make a point.

388
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,130
That's smart.

389
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,920
Xiao Bai, I'm leaving.

390
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,980
Okay, bye.

391
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,200
Bai, I've reserved a table.
Pack up.

392
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,800
Sure, bye.

393
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,350
Is Mr Zhuo back yet?

394
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,800
He's not coming back today.

395
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,950
What?

396
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,790
<i>How is it going?</i>

397
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,830
Do you like her?

398
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm just looking around.

399
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,450
She's coming over to our office
for recording.

400
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,870
If you like her...

401
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,860
Really?

402
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,170
I'm obsessed with her.

403
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,490
Will you bring me to your office
to see her?

404
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,960
No problem.

405
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,920
This is my name card.

406
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,320
When Mr Zhuo is back,

407
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,590
inform me at the first instance.

408
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,620
No problem.

409
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,390
That's great!

410
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,000
Do you want some fish?

411
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,570
These snakeheads reached only today.

412
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,570
They're fresh.

413
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,680
Listen.

414
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,910
The snakehead is best for soup making.

415
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,620
It's good for muscles
and it helps in wound healing.

416
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,310
What do you think?
Will you buy a snakehead?

417
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll get one.

418
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,860
Sure.

419
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,160
It's just a machine.

420
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,770
Can it print a weapon?

421
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,850
If we work on the materials,

422
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,080
any object

423
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,180
can be produced with data.

424
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,800
3D printing will rule the world soon.

425
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,900
We, on the other hand,

426
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,610
is changing the rules of the game

427
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,790
in the present world.

428
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,570
Are you trying to print weapons

429
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,230
because of the owner of that car plate?

430
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,740
What have you found?

431
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,310
It's not confirmed yet.

432
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,390
It's time for dinner.

433
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,610
Is this a new bowl?

434
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,100
Do you need so many bowls?

435
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,260
No, I don't need it.

436
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,900
Why did you buy it then?

437
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,010
You don't have to use all the tableware.

438
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,430
You can appreciate the beauty.

439
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,160
Can you see that?

440
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,840
I plan to buy more

441
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,270
beautiful tableware
and hang them on the wall.

442
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,820
It'd look nice in the photos.

443
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,650
You're just fooling around.

444
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,620
Life is all about
fooling around endlessly.

445
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,180
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

446
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:55,880
♫ It could be the destiny
but it is not practical ♫

447
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,410
♫ Your expression popped out on my mind ♫

448
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:10,270
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

449
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,230
Here.

450
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,740
The steamed dumplings are ready.

451
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,810
Have you taken a shower?

452
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,760
Didn't I tell you

453
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,270
you must keep the wound dry?

454
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,260
I didn't wet it.

455
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,820
Listen, take care of the wound.

456
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,090
Don't take it lightly.

457
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,640
If the wound is infected,

458
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,070
you'll ruin my reputation.

459
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,970
What reputation do you have?
The reputation of a houseman?

460
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,590
What's wrong with being a houseman?

461
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,960
A houseman can be passionate
and ambitious too. Okay?

462
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,950
Think about it.

463
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,410
All the experts

464
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,970
used to be a houseman

465
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,390
who had ascended with time.

466
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,210
If everyone treats us differently

467
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,110
just like you,

468
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,800
how do doctors become better?

469
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,190
How does medicine field develop?

470
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,430
The fish soup is bland.

471
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,120
What are you doing?

472
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,250
Don't add salt!

473
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,640
If you consume too much of salt at night,

474
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,970
it'll cause more burden to kidneys.

475
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,080
You will be at a risk of losing caesium.

476
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,440
Furthermore, it may trigger

477
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,400
tens of diseases including stomach cancer.

478
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,030
It's not good for wound healing too.

479
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,760
More importantly...

480
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,750
More importantly,
you're having an early menopause.

481
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,440
Premature menopause.

482
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,790
My mum used to have the same symptoms.

483
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,260
Liang Mu Ze!

484
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,190
Liang Mu Ze!

485
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,730
Give me back the fish soup!

486
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,760
Give it back to me!

487
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,410
Give me back the snakehead fish soup!

488
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,750
Give it back to me!

489
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,190
Oh no.

490
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,260
He is mental!

491
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,010
He insisted to add
so much of salt in the soup.

492
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,950
He ruined the soup.

493
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,600
Just let him be. It's not for you anyway.

494
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,750
Why are you so upset with him?

495
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,790
I bought the snakehead. I cooked the soup.

496
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,000
I even treated his wound.

497
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,130
I need to be responsible to my cooking

498
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,840
and my patient.

499
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,190
You're nothing but stubborn.

500
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,790
He just added some salt in the soup.
How is that a big deal?

501
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,240
Do you know?

502
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,530
Liang Mu Ze

503
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,190
did so many strange things.

504
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,030
<i>He doesn't sleep at night.</i>

505
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,880
<i>He's always posing
in the living room for no reason.</i>

506
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,720
<i>I saw that many times by chance.</i>

507
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,350
What's going on?

508
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,090
<i>He would just</i>

509
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,480
stare

510
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,500
straight into your eyes.

511
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,080
It's really scary.

512
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,360
You make a man

513
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,730
sleep on a bed covered
with Sailor Moon printed bedding set.

514
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,510
It'd be strange if he can fall asleep.

515
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,960
Also,

516
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,130
he insists to
close the curtain during day time.

517
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,390
The whole house is lifeless.

518
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,190
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

519
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,670
I'm trying to avoid the light.

520
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,280
This is my curtain!

521
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,610
This is my house.

522
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,800
Is he a cactus monster or what?

523
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,500
He's full of thorns!

524
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,700
Being vigilant at all times

525
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,520
could be a conditioned reflex

526
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,050
as he's a military officer.

527
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,390
<i>Please let me know at first instance
when he's back</i>

528
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,310
It's nothing do to with being vigilant.

529
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,760
He's too bossy.

530
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,960
He wants to take control of everything.

531
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,510
He wouldn't even allow me to sing.

532
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,590
♫ Missing you so much ♫

533
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,540
♫ Protecting me at all times ♫

534
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,700
Xia Chu.

535
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,890
-What's wrong?
-Will you stop singing?

536
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,030
Will you stop singing?

537
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,890
What's wrong?

538
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,410
My singing is not too bad.

539
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,470
Are you sure?

540
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,150
You must have misunderstood
the meaning of "not too bad".

541
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,010
I think it's all right.

542
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,470
You're asking too much.

543
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:19,590
♫ Thoughts of you are like a river ♫

544
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,510
♫ Protecting me at all times ♫

545
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,530
Xia Chu.

546
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,820
What's wrong?

547
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,880
Are you awake now?

548
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,910
-Liang Mu Ze!
-What?

549
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,460
That's too much, isn't it?

550
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,170
He's inhumane.

551
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,720
However, Dr Xia,

552
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,370
why don't you consider

553
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,850
some other hobbies?

554
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,810
After all, your singing

555
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,230
is truly annoying.

556
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,850
Who is annoyed?

557
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,630
I'm the annoyed one, okay?

558
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,650
Listen.

559
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,010
What drives me up the wall is

560
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,830
he caused harm to Er Miao!

561
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,870
Did you feed it raw meat?

562
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,840
Yes.

563
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,800
It doesn't eat raw meat.

564
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,770
That's why it's yearning it. Am I right?

565
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,920
Of course.

566
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,110
I love meat. Especially ones like you.

567
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,110
Spend the rest of your life with him.

568
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,350
Spend the rest of your life with me.

569
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,930
Okay?

570
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,630
Sure.

571
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,270
You're a pervert cat!

572
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,900
Spend the rest of your life with me.

573
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,330
I'm dying.

574
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,040
You brought a female cat home.

575
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,570
If it's a male cat,

576
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,750
it would be following you around.

577
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,390
I'm so irritated.
How could you still laughing at me?

578
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,010
What is so irritating?

579
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,470
You didn't sell yourself to him.

580
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,930
If you can't put up with him,
just move out.

581
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,640
It's easy to say.

582
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,420
Moving out

583
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,350
means looking for a house
and redecorating the place.

584
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,460
I don't have the time.

585
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,430
Ladies, do you like the bed?

586
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,520
Thank you.

587
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,440
By the way, is your landlord

588
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,830
really so annoying?
Doesn't he have some plus points?

589
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,590
He's not really annoying.

590
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,790
He's just strange.

591
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,050
Speaking about plus points,

592
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,920
the training camp that he's in
is quite near to the hospital.

593
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,360
There were a few occasions
where he stayed at home

594
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,670
and he let me hitch a ride
to the hospital the next day.

595
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,540
Compared to most guys,

596
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,080
he's quite tidy and neat.

597
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,710
He is hygienic.

598
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,400
He always makes his bed.

599
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,020
It's as if no one has slept on it.

600
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,060
Furthermore...

601
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,720
What?

602
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,400
Come in.

603
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,080
Liang Mu Ze.

604
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,180
What's wrong?

605
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,070
Well...

606
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,660
I heard noises
coming from the living hall.

607
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,390
Can't you hear that?

608
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,930
No.

609
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,220
I think I must have heard it wrongly.

610
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,100
Well...

611
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,450
There are thunders and lightnings.

612
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,430
It's quite loud.

613
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,130
Are you scared?

614
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,480
I'm not scared.

615
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,510
I'm a little scared.

616
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,660
Forget it.

617
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm going back to my room.

618
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,800
Let's go to the living room.

619
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,110
I can't sleep anyway.

620
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,370
Liang Mu Ze.

621
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,390
Are you having insomnia again?

622
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,170
If you can't fall asleep,

623
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,960
you can try meditation.

624
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,160
Firstly,

625
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,370
close your eyes.

626
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,890
Relax your body.

627
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,310
Then, starting counting.

628
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:58,220
One, two, three, four, five.

629
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,990
Inhale.

630
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,230
Count to five.

631
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,450
Exhale.

632
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,820
Inhale.

633
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,220
Exhale.

634
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,240
No matter what,

635
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,000
ever since we share a house,

636
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,370
my mum doesn't have to worry

637
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,550
about my safety anymore.

638
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,870
In that case,

639
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,590
he's not completely useless.

640
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,170
Then why are you picking on him?

641
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,490
Please know your position.

642
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,610
He's your landlord.

643
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,910
He's not your husband.

644
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,330
As long as
he doesn't install a hidden camera

645
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,490
to peek on you

646
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,250
or doesn't sell his house away,

647
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,980
all the other things
are not important.

648
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,570
Of course.

649
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,550
If you plan to move in with him,

650
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,900
then we shall adjust the standards.

651
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,330
I don't plan to move in with him.

652
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,530
Do you know?

653
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,600
Everything that you just complained

654
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,870
sounded as if both of you
are a little couple

655
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,380
trying to get along with each other.

656
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

657
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,970
It's quite good actually.

658
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,690
At least you have someone
to pick fight with at home.

659
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,070
You guys can take care of each other too.

660
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,720
It's better than living alone like me.

661
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,360
<i>Mr Zhuo is back in the office.</i>

662
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,770
<i>He wants to have dinner
with you tonight.</i>

663
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,830
I have to go.

664
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,070
Why are you in a rush?

665
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,000
Slow down.

666
00:42:33,974 --> 00:43:03,974
