<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,540
<i>Episode 6</i>

4
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,030
Sure.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,400
Thank you.

6
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,679
How is it?

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,380
<i>Zhuo Ran</i>

8
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,510
I cooked seafood porridge.

9
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,600
I'll turn off the heat
if you don't want to eat.

10
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,720
It's to save electricity.

11
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,630
Bring me some.

12
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,240
Such a brat!

13
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,320
"Bring me some."

14
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,550
Isn't that my book?

15
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,750
This is my house.

16
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,230
Did you prepare steamed bun?

17
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,430
No.

18
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,610
I've homemade whole grain pancakes though.

19
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,910
Do you want to try?

20
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,150
Bring it here.

21
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,790
It smells wonderful. I want to try it too!

22
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,680
It's quite delicious.

23
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,160
Of course.

24
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,430
It would go well with pickles.

25
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,490
Liang Mu Ze.

26
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,800
Have of you heard of a story before?

27
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,120
Long, long time ago, a man

28
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,290
kept bossing his housemate

29
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,870
who was a doctor around.

30
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,029
Finally, one day,

31
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,830
his housemate poisoned him to death

32
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,790
without anyone knowing.

33
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,150
Haven't you heard that story before?

34
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,350
I've heard about a story.

35
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,110
It's about a Special Forces soldier

36
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,870
who was poisoned to death.

37
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,570
Three seconds
before the poison came into effect,

38
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,130
he punched the person
who poisoned him to death.

39
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,359
Have you heard of the story?

40
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,410
What a coward.

41
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,950
Thank you.

42
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,910
The book is nice, isn't it?

43
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,830
Can you guess who the murderer is?

44
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,920
It's not Umeda Hachiro for sure.

45
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,350
It's not him for sure.

46
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,400
The story is like this.

47
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,590
Let me tell you.

48
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,840
In the end,

49
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,200
Mitarai was the one
who resolved

50
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,470
the Tokyo Zodiac Murders.

51
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,710
Isn't it interesting?

52
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,450
I have many detective novels on the shelf.

53
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,990
I can tell you the ending one by one.

54
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,710
Do you know what is

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,700
the most miserable thing in life?

56
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,410
Not having any canned food.

57
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,010
Misery is when you're reading the climax

58
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,400
of a detective novel,

59
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,520
someone breaks the ending to you
without warning.

60
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,810
Is detective novel
tastier than canned food?

61
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,870
I bet Liang Mu Ze

62
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,510
is as upset as
having constipation for five days.

63
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,470
He deserves it.

64
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,410
He was lazying in the sofa
like a braised egg

65
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,090
and bossing me around
as if I was his babysitter.

66
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,070
Let me tell you.

67
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,190
This is just a warning.

68
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,150
If he does that to me again,

69
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,470
You better shut up now.

70
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,430
I'll...

71
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,940
Have you finished taking a shower?

72
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,310
Hug me, handsome.

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,900
Do you want some tea?

74
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,870
Yes.

75
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,320
Sure.

76
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,480
Here you go.

77
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,670
Please try it.

78
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,480
What's that smell?

79
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,900
What's wrong?

80
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,550
Take it away.

81
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,109
Did you just bring my toilet bowl here?

82
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,410
Take it away.

83
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,890
Are you scared of durian?

84
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,640
I'm not scared of it. I don't like it.

85
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,790
So you're scared of it.

86
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,270
Take it away!

87
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,650
Sure. Don't be scared.

88
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,460
Here.

89
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,440
Drink some tea to calm down.

90
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,730
Here.

91
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,760
I'll finish all of it.

92
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,470
Are you done?

93
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,420
Liang Mu Ze, you're so sensitive.

94
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Don't go.

95
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,290
I'm just joking.

96
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:48,410
Take it away!

97
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:49,750
It's not easy to brew the tea.

98
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,880
At least take a sip. Don't waste it.

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,980
It's either I leave or you take it away.

100
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,880
I'll take it away.

101
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,060
I'll get lost.

102
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,000
Is it nice?

103
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,160
Is this Pre-Qingming Longjing?

104
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,760
Suitable for kids.

105
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
You know about tea too?

106
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,170
So what?

107
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,450
I swear I'm not secretly thinking that
you're old-fashioned.

108
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,870
My grandma loves drinking tea.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,370
When I was young,
I always had Longjing, Pu'er

110
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,000
with her.

111
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,760
I see.

112
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,160
When you go back to
your hometown next time,

113
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,520
I'll prepare some tea leaves for you

114
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,550
so that you can bring it back
for your grandma.

115
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,770
No need.

116
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,310
Don't be shy.

117
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,930
Before I left, I had stolen
quite a bit of tea leaves

118
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,280
from my dad's tea cabinet.

119
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,790
My home is near to Hangzhou.

120
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,050
I have quite many opportunities
to taste Longjing every year.

121
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,340
No matter how expensive tea is,

122
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,000
it is meant to be tasted by people.

123
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,170
Its value will only be reflected

124
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,440
when more people try it.

125
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,030
Don't feel sorry for me.

126
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,810
No need.

127
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,460
Don't be shy.

128
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,250
My grandma passed away long time ago.

129
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,510
My grandma passed away long time ago too.

130
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,150
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
I didn't know that.

132
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,390
My bed is not covered with bed sheets.

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,010
If you feel sorry for me,

134
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,870
lend me a bed sheet
and make the bed for me.

135
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,480
Sure, I'll do it.

136
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,540
Something is not right.

137
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,550
Why should I feel sorry for him?

138
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,570
He mentioned his grandma first.

139
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,840
I didn't know that.

140
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,010
Why should I contribute my bed sheet?

141
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,190
Why should I make his bed?

142
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,590
Who does he think he is?

143
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,430
He is your landlord.

144
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,750
It's either you put up with him
or you leave.

145
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,550
Make the bed for him, huh?

146
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,670
Sad story, huh?

147
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,910
Fine, let's make his wish come true.

148
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,560
I've a bad hunch.

149
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,020
And in the name of the Moon,
I will punish you!

150
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,440
Liang Mu Ze.

151
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,820
Poop-picker, wake up! You're getting late.

152
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,370
I'm going to be late.

153
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,790
Will you stop staring at me?

154
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm sorry. I came to the wrong place.

155
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm doomed.

156
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,410
I'm leaving.

157
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,560
Finish it before you leave.

158
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,210
Thank you.

159
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,220
Did you go out to get milk
early in the morning?

160
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,520
I didn't buy it.

161
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,910
You left it in the fridge.

162
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,740
You got it from the fridge?
I didn't keep milk in the fridge.

163
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,900
It's here.

164
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,830
Why did you give it to me?

165
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,600
It's not expired. I've checked.

166
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,290
It's whipping cream.

167
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,400
Do you know

168
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,150
how many calories it contains?

169
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,210
I have no idea.

170
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,570
Why did you give it to me then?

171
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,880
You kind of enjoyed it.

172
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,360
-Liang Mu Ze!
-You're going to be late.

173
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,540
What did you say?

174
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,850
Forget it. I'll get another driver.

175
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,130
It's okay.

176
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,100
Are you having motion sickness?

177
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,960
It's gut fermentation syndrome.

178
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,150
I feel like vomiting.

179
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,390
It's okay.

180
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,680
Just put up with it.

181
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,680
It's not a serious problem.

182
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:31,840
Don't be dramatic.

183
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,510
You need to be strong.

184
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,640
Liang Mu Ze, you said that on purpose.

185
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,380
You're thinking too much.

186
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,090
I'm just an old hog.

187
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,790
I can't tell

188
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,730
whipping cream and milk apart.

189
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,950
They're the same to me.

190
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,930
You're talking nonsense!

191
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,920
You're angry at me

192
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,250
as I made your bed
with a printed Sailor Moon bedding set.

193
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,440
You're seeking revenge.

194
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,360
Listen.

195
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,480
You're a special forces soldier

196
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,910
and yet you're so petty.

197
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,440
For a man like you,

198
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,410
let alone insomnia,

199
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,360
you may drop dead one day soon.

200
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,350
Who is the petty one?

201
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,330
It's you.

202
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,190
We're here.

203
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,040
Good morning, Xia Chu.

204
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,390
Good morning.

205
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,640
He's my comrade.

206
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,990
Will you get down now?

207
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,790
Why are you here?

208
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,430
I'm here for something.

209
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,860
Have you eaten breakfast?

210
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,090
Yes, I've eaten.

211
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,040
Keep it for lunch.

212
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,160
What's wrong?

213
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,080
Take it away.
I can't look at it the same way anymore.

214
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,750
This is my comrade.

215
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,290
Find out someone for me.

216
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,760
It's one week after the patient,
Luo Xiao Jun underwent the surgery.

217
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,870
It's time for the review
of heart ultrasonography.

218
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,590
There's no blood clot on septal occluder.

219
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,450
The reading of blood cell count
and coagulation index are normal.

220
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,950
No active bleeding is found.

221
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,100
The drainage tube was removed last night.

222
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,860
That's great.

223
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,200
Dr Zhang

224
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,310
has completed yet another challenge.

225
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,350
The coagulation during the intervention

226
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,000
and the bleeding management
during thoracotomy

227
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,440
were managed well.

228
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,800
I don't deserve all the credit.

229
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,290
Thanks to Xia Chu.

230
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,270
All right. Xia Chu should
come out with a case report.

231
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,750
She's pregnant!

232
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,450
I'm not pregnant.

233
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,410
You're pregnant.

234
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,990
You almost puked.

235
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,220
So what?

236
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,850
That's the sign of pregnancy.

237
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,980
Xiao Jun, don't talk nonsense.

238
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,830
It's always shown on TV.

239
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,260
Stop talking.

240
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,680
Why are you laughing?

241
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,510
Yang Mu Ze is such a jerk!

242
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,860
If it ever happens again,

243
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,650
I'll poison you to death!

244
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,130
The military medical doctor

245
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,010
needs to attend to something urgent.

246
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,810
They need our help.

247
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,920
Get ready.

248
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,100
Why is it me?

249
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,490
As Mr Zhang said,

250
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,310
we need to send a houseman there.

251
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,400
You're not in.

252
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,340
All of us

253
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,650
unanimously recommended you
as the representative.

254
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,580
Are you really pregnant?

255
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,600
If you admit that you studied eight years
in medical school for nothing,

256
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,080
I'll admit that I'm pregnant.

257
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,070
Are you pregnant
and he refuses to be responsible?

258
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,630
Isn't that the storyline?

259
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,600
Who refuses to be responsible?
What nonsense are you talking about?

260
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,910
That military officer.

261
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,560
If not so,
why would you poison him to death?

262
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,310
That's between him and me.

263
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,970
All right. I got it.

264
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,090
Go now.

265
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,080
The success of the surgery

266
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,520
has further strengthened our determination

267
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,850
to develop and produce

268
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,390
3D technology.

269
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,920
I hope we can start from
the department of cardiothoracic surgery.

270
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,210
We shall work together

271
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,450
to set up a special fund

272
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,950
for 3D Printing and hologram technology

273
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,360
which is non-profit making.

274
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,370
It's to expedite

275
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,510
the development of 3D technology.

276
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,560
From my personal view,

277
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,070
clinical technology innovation

278
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,230
is definitely a good movement.

279
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,480
We welcome such exploration.

280
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
However, as for the hospital,

281
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,040
we need further discussion on it.

282
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,510
We can do it.

283
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,800
However, as for the mode of operation

284
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,190
of the special fund,

285
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,880
we need further clarification.

286
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,170
Don't worry. I'll draft a

287
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,580
Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement
as soon as possible

288
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,880
and explain to all of you in detail.

289
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,570
That's great.

290
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,990
We'll wait for the good news, Mr Zhuo.

291
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,040
Dr Zhang.

292
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,960
Thank you for making the contact.

293
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,150
Sorry to have troubled you.

294
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,350
Don't worry.

295
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,150
Not to mention you're Xia Chu's friend.

296
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,160
Personalized medicine

297
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,620
is the trend.

298
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,310
3D printing technology

299
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,010
is an important element.

300
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,260
If the special fund

301
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,040
can go through smoothly,

302
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,150
I think

303
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,800
it's beneficial to everyone

304
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,470
be it your company,

305
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,460
our hospital and department

306
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,980
or our potential patients.

307
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,210
It's a win-win situation.

308
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,510
It's worth doing.

309
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,240
Do you have time for lunch?

310
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
I would like to treat you

311
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,990
and Xia Chu a meal.

312
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,400
I need to conduct a surgery
in the afternoon.

313
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,830
Furthermore, Xia Chu hasn't come back yet.

314
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,050
Where did she go?

315
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,430
She's gone to the military camp
for health security tasks.

316
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,990
Are you looking for her?

317
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,080
<i>It's such a hot day</i>

318
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,050
yet you guys have to work under hot sun.

319
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,190
Thank you for the hard work.

320
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,070
It's our duty.

321
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,640
It's mainly because

322
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,550
casualties have increased lately.

323
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,370
Not only do I have to manage equipment
and medicine supply alone,

324
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,680
I also have to take care of the patients.

325
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,070
I'm really up to my neck.

326
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,670
What are they doing?

327
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,790
Have you heard about
The Heavenly Maid Scatters Blossoms?

328
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,450
It's time for you to see new things.

329
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,440
Liang Mu Ze, can you do it?

330
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,300
He's Liang Mu Ze
of Special Forces Brigade.

331
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,470
His marksmanship

332
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,090
was made known in the division
during the training.

333
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,800
Some people call him

334
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,220
the God of Guns.

335
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,630
God?

336
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,930
He's just mental.

337
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,670
Get ready to shoot.

<i>Treatment Room</i>

341
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,620
The wound is not too bad.
No stitches are needed.

342
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,240
Stop moving!

343
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,500
It's too big.

344
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,850
What?

345
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,040
The plaster is too big.

346
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,100
It's not nice looking.

347
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,720
Everyone looks ugly when they're injured.

348
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,560
Don't bolster yourself
if you want to look good.

349
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,530
Why did you fool around for no reason?

350
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,720
Do you really think that
I was fooling around?

351
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,860
Weren't you?

352
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,690
You shot down cans of beer in a row.

353
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,430
No doubt it's interesting to watch

354
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,330
but what can the tricks do

355
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,400
when it comes to actual battle?

356
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,960
A few years back,

357
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,000
there was a kidnapping case.

358
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,510
The Special Forces
had to assist the SWAT

359
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,890
in rescuing the hostages.

360
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,050
However, the kidnappers

361
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,470
threw a gas tank right off the roof.

362
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,800
Fortunately, an officer found out about it

363
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,320
and shot the gas tank with a gun.

364
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,100
The gas tank exploded in the air.

365
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,140
Not only did he save himself,

366
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,730
he also saved the hostages.

367
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,760
He also saved the onlooking crowd.

368
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,450
You're right.

369
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,590
It's not practical in war.

370
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
However, in a battlefield,

371
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,840
one will encounter more violent situations
with blood and gore.

372
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,230
Those situations can only be handled by

373
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,880
these unusual training.

374
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,040
It's done.

375
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,190
Where is the sink?

376
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,520
It's next door.

377
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,120
Thank you.

378
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,260
By the way,

379
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,930
take care of the wound hygiene.

380
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,170
Rest well.

381
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,090
-Keep the wound dry.
-Sure.

382
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,820
The kidnapping case that you mentioned

383
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,010
sounded dangerous.

384
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,650
Did you experience it on your own

385
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,960
or did you hear it from someone?

386
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,790
I made up the incident.

387
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,990
I just wanted to make a point.

388
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,330
That's smart.

389
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Xiao Bai, I'm leaving.

390
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,180
Okay, bye.

391
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,400
Bai, I've reserved a table.
Pack up.

392
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,000
Sure, bye.

393
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,550
Is Mr Zhuo back yet?

394
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,000
He's not coming back today.

395
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,150
What?

396
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,990
<i>How is it going?</i>

397
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,030
Do you like her?

398
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,640
I'm just looking around.

399
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,650
She's coming over to our office
for recording.

400
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,070
If you like her...

401
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,060
Really?

402
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,370
I'm obsessed with her.

403
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,690
Will you bring me to your office
to see her?

404
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,160
No problem.

405
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,120
This is my name card.

406
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,520
When Mr Zhuo is back,

407
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,790
inform me at the first instance.

408
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,820
No problem.

409
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,590
That's great!

410
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,200
Do you want some fish?

411
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,770
These snakeheads reached only today.

412
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,770
They're fresh.

413
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,880
Listen.

414
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,110
The snakehead is best for soup making.

415
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,820
It's good for muscles
and it helps in wound healing.

416
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,510
What do you think?
Will you buy a snakehead?

417
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,840
I'll get one.

418
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,060
Sure.

419
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,360
It's just a machine.

420
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,970
Can it print a weapon?

421
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,050
If we work on the materials,

422
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,280
any object

423
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,380
can be produced with data.

424
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,000
3D printing will rule the world soon.

425
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,100
We, on the other hand,

426
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,810
is changing the rules of the game

427
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,990
in the present world.

428
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,770
Are you trying to print weapons

429
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,430
because of the owner of that car plate?

430
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,940
What have you found?

431
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,510
It's not confirmed yet.

432
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,590
It's time for dinner.

433
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,810
Is this a new bowl?

434
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,300
Do you need so many bowls?

435
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,460
No, I don't need it.

436
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,100
Why did you buy it then?

437
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,210
You don't have to use all the tableware.

438
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,630
You can appreciate the beauty.

439
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,360
Can you see that?

440
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,040
I plan to buy more

441
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,470
beautiful tableware
and hang them on the wall.

442
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,020
It'd look nice in the photos.

443
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,850
You're just fooling around.

444
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,820
Life is all about
fooling around endlessly.

445
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,380
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

446
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:56,080
♫ It could be the destiny
but it is not practical ♫

447
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,610
♫ Your expression popped out on my mind ♫

448
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:10,470
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

449
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,430
Here.

450
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,940
The steamed dumplings are ready.

451
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,010
Have you taken a shower?

452
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:19,960
Didn't I tell you

453
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,470
you must keep the wound dry?

454
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,460
I didn't wet it.

455
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,020
Listen, take care of the wound.

456
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,290
Don't take it lightly.

457
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,840
If the wound is infected,

458
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,270
you'll ruin my reputation.

459
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,170
What reputation do you have?
The reputation of a houseman?

460
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,790
What's wrong with being a houseman?

461
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,160
A houseman can be passionate
and ambitious too. Okay?

462
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,150
Think about it.

463
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,610
All the experts

464
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,170
used to be a houseman

465
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,590
who had ascended with time.

466
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,410
If everyone treats us differently

467
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,310
just like you,

468
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,000
how do doctors become better?

469
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,390
How does medicine field develop?

470
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,630
The fish soup is bland.

471
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,320
What are you doing?

472
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,450
Don't add salt!

473
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,840
If you consume too much of salt at night,

474
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,170
it'll cause more burden to kidneys.

475
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,280
You will be at a risk of losing caesium.

476
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,640
Furthermore, it may trigger

477
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,600
tens of diseases including stomach cancer.

478
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,230
It's not good for wound healing too.

479
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,960
More importantly...

480
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,950
More importantly,
you're having an early menopause.

481
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,640
Premature menopause.

482
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,990
My mum used to have the same symptoms.

483
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,460
Liang Mu Ze!

484
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,390
Liang Mu Ze!

485
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,930
Give me back the fish soup!

486
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,960
Give it back to me!

487
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,610
Give me back the snakehead fish soup!

488
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,950
Give it back to me!

489
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,390
Oh no.

490
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,460
He is mental!

491
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,210
He insisted to add
so much of salt in the soup.

492
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,150
He ruined the soup.

493
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,800
Just let him be. It's not for you anyway.

494
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,950
Why are you so upset with him?

495
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,990
I bought the snakehead. I cooked the soup.

496
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,200
I even treated his wound.

497
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,330
I need to be responsible to my cooking

498
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,040
and my patient.

499
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,390
You're nothing but stubborn.

500
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,990
He just added some salt in the soup.
How is that a big deal?

501
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,440
Do you know?

502
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,730
Liang Mu Ze

503
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,390
did so many strange things.

504
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,230
<i>He doesn't sleep at night.</i>

505
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,080
<i>He's always posing
in the living room for no reason.</i>

506
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,920
<i>I saw that many times by chance.</i>

507
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,550
What's going on?

508
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,290
<i>He would just</i>

509
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,680
stare

510
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,700
straight into your eyes.

511
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,280
It's really scary.

512
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,560
You make a man

513
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:56,930
sleep on a bed covered
with Sailor Moon printed bedding set.

514
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,710
It'd be strange if he can fall asleep.

515
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,160
Also,

516
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,330
he insists to
close the curtain during day time.

517
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,590
The whole house is lifeless.

518
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,390
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

519
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,870
I'm trying to avoid the light.

520
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,480
This is my curtain!

521
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,810
This is my house.

522
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,000
Is he a cactus monster or what?

523
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,700
He's full of thorns!

524
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,900
Being vigilant at all times

525
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,720
could be a conditioned reflex

526
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,250
as he's a military officer.

527
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,590
<i>Please let me know at first instance
when he's back</i>

528
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,510
It's nothing do to with being vigilant.

529
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,960
He's too bossy.

530
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,160
He wants to take control of everything.

531
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,710
He wouldn't even allow me to sing.

532
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,790
♫ Missing you so much ♫

533
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,740
♫ Protecting me at all times ♫

534
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,900
Xia Chu.

535
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,090
-What's wrong?
-Will you stop singing?

536
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,230
Will you stop singing?

537
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,090
What's wrong?

538
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,610
My singing is not too bad.

539
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,670
Are you sure?

540
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,350
You must have misunderstood
the meaning of "not too bad".

541
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,210
I think it's all right.

542
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,670
You're asking too much.

543
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:19,790
♫ Thoughts of you are like a river ♫

544
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,710
♫ Protecting me at all times ♫

545
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,730
Xia Chu.

546
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,020
What's wrong?

547
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,080
Are you awake now?

548
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,110
-Liang Mu Ze!
-What?

549
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,660
That's too much, isn't it?

550
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,370
He's inhumane.

551
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,920
However, Dr Xia,

552
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,570
why don't you consider

553
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,050
some other hobbies?

554
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,010
After all, your singing

555
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,430
is truly annoying.

556
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,050
Who is annoyed?

557
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,830
I'm the annoyed one, okay?

558
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,850
Listen.

559
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,210
What drives me up the wall is

560
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,030
he caused harm to Er Miao!

561
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,070
Did you feed it raw meat?

562
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,040
Yes.

563
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,000
It doesn't eat raw meat.

564
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,970
That's why it's yearning it. Am I right?

565
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,120
Of course.

566
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,310
I love meat. Especially ones like you.

567
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,310
Spend the rest of your life with him.

568
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,550
Spend the rest of your life with me.

569
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,130
Okay?

570
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,830
Sure.

571
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,470
You're a pervert cat!

572
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,100
Spend the rest of your life with me.

573
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,530
I'm dying.

574
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,240
You brought a female cat home.

575
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,770
If it's a male cat,

576
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,950
it would be following you around.

577
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,590
I'm so irritated.
How could you still laughing at me?

578
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,210
What is so irritating?

579
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,670
You didn't sell yourself to him.

580
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,130
If you can't put up with him,
just move out.

581
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,840
It's easy to say.

582
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,620
Moving out

583
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,550
means looking for a house
and redecorating the place.

584
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,660
I don't have the time.

585
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,630
Ladies, do you like the bed?

586
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,720
Thank you.

587
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,640
By the way, is your landlord

588
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,030
really so annoying?
Doesn't he have some plus points?

589
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,790
He's not really annoying.

590
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,990
He's just strange.

591
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,250
Speaking about plus points,

592
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,120
the training camp that he's in
is quite near to the hospital.

593
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,560
There were a few occasions
where he stayed at home

594
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,870
and he let me hitch a ride
to the hospital the next day.

595
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,740
Compared to most guys,

596
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,280
he's quite tidy and neat.

597
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,910
He is hygienic.

598
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,600
He always makes his bed.

599
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,220
It's as if no one has slept on it.

600
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,260
Furthermore...

601
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,920
What?

602
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,600
Come in.

603
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,280
Liang Mu Ze.

604
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,380
What's wrong?

605
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,270
Well...

606
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,860
I heard noises
coming from the living hall.

607
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,590
Can't you hear that?

608
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,130
No.

609
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,420
I think I must have heard it wrongly.

610
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,300
Well...

611
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,650
There are thunders and lightnings.

612
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,630
It's quite loud.

613
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,330
Are you scared?

614
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,680
I'm not scared.

615
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,710
I'm a little scared.

616
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,860
Forget it.

617
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,360
I'm going back to my room.

618
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,000
Let's go to the living room.

619
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,310
I can't sleep anyway.

620
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,570
Liang Mu Ze.

621
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,590
Are you having insomnia again?

622
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,370
If you can't fall asleep,

623
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,160
you can try meditation.

624
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,360
Firstly,

625
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,570
close your eyes.

626
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,090
Relax your body.

627
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,510
Then, starting counting.

628
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:58,420
One, two, three, four, five.

629
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,190
Inhale.

630
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,430
Count to five.

631
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,650
Exhale.

632
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,020
Inhale.

633
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,420
Exhale.

634
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,440
No matter what,

635
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,200
ever since we share a house,

636
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,570
my mum doesn't have to worry

637
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,750
about my safety anymore.

638
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,070
In that case,

639
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,790
he's not completely useless.

640
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,370
Then why are you picking on him?

641
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,690
Please know your position.

642
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,810
He's your landlord.

643
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,110
He's not your husband.

644
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,530
As long as
he doesn't install a hidden camera

645
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,690
to peek on you

646
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,450
or doesn't sell his house away,

647
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,180
all the other things
are not important.

648
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,770
Of course.

649
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,750
If you plan to move in with him,

650
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,100
then we shall adjust the standards.

651
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,530
I don't plan to move in with him.

652
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,730
Do you know?

653
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,800
Everything that you just complained

654
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,070
sounded as if both of you
are a little couple

655
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,580
trying to get along with each other.

656
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,710
What nonsense are you talking about?

657
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,170
It's quite good actually.

658
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,890
At least you have someone
to pick fight with at home.

659
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,270
You guys can take care of each other too.

660
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,920
It's better than living alone like me.

661
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,560
<i>Mr Zhuo is back in the office.</i>

662
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,970
<i>He wants to have dinner
with you tonight.</i>

663
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,030
I have to go.

664
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,270
Why are you in a rush?

665
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,200
Slow down.

666
00:42:34,174 --> 00:43:04,174
