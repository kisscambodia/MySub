00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,120
<i>Episode 7</i>

4
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,990
Please enjoy the food.

5
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,080
About the show...

6
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,670
Currently, the form and content

7
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,680
have not been confirmed yet.

8
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,740
If you have any ideas,

9
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,320
feel free to tell me anytime.

10
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
Of course,

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
throughout the recording process,

12
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,540
we'll also fully respect your opinions.

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,820
-About the...
-How did you know Xia Chu?

14
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,470
We started as Internet friends.

15
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,610
I found an article

16
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,610
she wrote on the Internet

17
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,760
about her first love.

18
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,360
At that time,

19
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,840
I was about to graduate from university.

20
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,890
I couldn't find a job yet.

21
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,390
Quota for postgraduate studies
had all been filled up.

22
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,610
My boyfriend wanted to break up with me.

23
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,090
I was extremely depressed.

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,470
But after reading her article,

25
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,660
I was inspired.

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,380
I replied to her article.

27
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,640
Then, we started texting
each other on WeChat.

28
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,880
Later on, we arranged a meet-up.

29
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,490
It's kind of weird.

30
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,810
Although our age gap

31
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,180
is quite big

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,180
and our personalities are so different,

33
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,290
but somehow we had

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,270
endless topics to talk about
every time we meet.

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,450
Maybe it's because

36
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,170
we are both brilliant individuals

37
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,840
and role models of outstanding
contemporary young women?

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,340
Hence we empathize and admire each other.

39
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,610
Did she ever mention to you about...

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,420
You?

41
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,870
Yes.

42
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,110
Me.

43
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,410
Of course she did.

44
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,460
She told me a lot

45
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,170
about your past with her.

46
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,230
What happened after that?

47
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,390
Was she in a new relationship?

48
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,730
She had a relationship
during her university years

49
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,630
but it ended very soon.

50
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,350
She was too busy.

51
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,430
Too busy?

52
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,010
Perhaps it was because she was too busy.

53
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,290
Perhaps it was because of other reasons.

54
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,270
Perhaps it was because of you.

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,440
What do you want to know?

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,930
<i>Long Yi</i>

57
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,440
Please excuse me.

58
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,280
<i>His name is Liang Mu Ze.</i>

59
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,600
<i>He's from the Special Forces.</i>

60
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,650
<i>Now an army major.</i>

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,420
<i>Xia Chu is close to him.</i>

62
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,620
<i>They're living in together now.</i>

63
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,100
I got it.

64
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,950
It's fine.

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,170
You should get going if you're busy.
Don't worry about me.

66
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,000
It's him.

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,640
It's really him.

68
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,610
Are you okay?

69
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,070
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

70
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,860
Please clear the front.

71
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,330
Make way, please.

72
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,180
Please make way.

73
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,270
I'm sorry. You have to wait outside.

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
<i>Military and Police Take Down Drug Den</i>

75
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,400
Cheers to our final night together.

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,160
Is everyone ready?

77
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,300
This is the final test
of this military training program,

78
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,050
namely the endurance test.

79
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,040
It's the ultimate test of your willpower.

80
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,060
As soon as someone touches the tear gas,

81
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll start the timer.

82
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,240
The test ends when each individual
leaves this room

83
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,990
and marks will be added
into your final scores.

84
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,400
In other words,

85
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,990
as long as you stay
in this room long enough,

86
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,030
you can still catch up with the scores
although you were behind?

87
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,030
That's right.

88
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,630
Good luck to everyone.

89
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,530
It's going to be a tough one today.

90
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,180
Liang Mu Ze.

91
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,580
You'll put the tear gas

92
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,220
-into the pot.
-Okay.

93
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,340
Let's make a deal first.

94
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,980
Whoever leaves this room first

95
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,940
will buy everyone a meal.

96
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,810
-Sure.
-No problem.

97
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,440
Liang Mu Ze.

98
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,720
How could you start
without telling us first?

99
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,250
I'm going all out.

100
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,060
I really want to know

101
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,060
if you were ever defeated before

102
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,010
all these years in the force.

103
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,040
Of course he was.

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,530
I'll take him down today.

105
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,310
I want to know

106
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,760
who that legend is.

107
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,370
I must meet him.

108
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,890
You can't meet him anymore.

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
He died in service.

110
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,130
If it wasn't for him,

111
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,390
I wouldn't be sitting here alive today.

112
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,390
This is wrong.

113
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,500
What did you say?

114
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,210
You should walk ahead of me.

115
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,620
Is there a difference?

116
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,850
It'll be the right direction
when you walk ahead of me.

117
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,280
Following you keeps me steady.

118
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,670
It has been eight years, Mu Ze.

119
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,780
You don't have to walk in my footsteps.

120
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,000
I need to.

121
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,120
To others,

122
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,960
many things may change in eight years.

123
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,220
But to me,

124
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,880
you'll always be my captain.

125
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,320
The patient is experiencing
ventricular tachycardia.

126
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,100
Get the defibrillator.

127
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,690
IV infusion, 100 mg of lidocaine.

128
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,520
Heart rate is back to normal.

129
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,530
Why did you drink so much today?

130
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,900
Don't you have to
return to the force tomorrow?

131
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,550
Stop drinking. It's bad for your stomach.

132
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,570
Tomorrow is an off day.

133
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,240
You cried?

134
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,270
Tear gas.

135
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,600
My head hurts.

136
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,410
I'll make you honey drink to sober up.

137
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,860
Sit down and talk with me.

138
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,170
Today is the anniversary of

139
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,050
Luo Liang's death.

140
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,820
Luo Liang?

141
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,870
Yes.

142
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,560
Xiao Jun's father.

143
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,730
You were right.

144
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,030
Eight years have passed.

145
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,080
But I still think he is here.

146
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,650
He is still by my side

147
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,410
and in my life.

148
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,590
Sometimes when I'm in my dreams

149
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,770
or when I had too much to drink,

150
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,920
I'll want to talk to him.

151
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,180
I can't believe and accept the fact that

152
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,060
he has totally disappeared

153
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,530
from my life.

154
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,770
I can't accept it.

155
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,810
<i>Luo Liang and I</i>

156
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,330
<i>majored in Special Forces
Military Training.</i>

157
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,850
<i>We joined the Special Forces Brigade
after we graduated.</i>

158
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,890
<i>Like our Brigade Captain Dong Zhi Gang
always said,</i>

159
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,510
<i>"When two similar sharp edges</i>

160
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,170
<i>with the same shine meet,</i>

161
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,330
<i>sparks will fly</i>

162
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,690
<i>when they collide."</i>

163
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,650
<i>We graduated the same year,</i>

164
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,610
<i>served under the same force,</i>

165
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,650
<i>and became platoon sergeants.</i>

166
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,760
<i>Everything was a competition between us.</i>

167
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,070
<i>We competed in our trainings</i>

168
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,430
<i>and shooting skills.</i>

169
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,500
Start!

170
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,660
-Beat him!
-You can do it!

171
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,270
<i>Even in the activity room
during break time,</i>

172
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,100
<i>we competed in</i>

173
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,410
<i>arm wrestling.</i>

174
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,420
You can do it!

175
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,010
You can do it!

176
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,730
<i>Those were the days in the force.</i>

177
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,690
<i>Everything was a competition.</i>

178
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>There must be a winner
and loser in everything.</i>

179
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,850
<i>Everyone gave his very best.</i>

180
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,630
Being passionate in everything
was the law of survival in the force.

181
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,770
It was also a special way of expressing

182
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,400
the friendship between Luo Liang and me.

183
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,850
At that time, comrades in the force

184
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,090
would call us

185
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,720
military elites who are equally matched.

186
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,810
When we were

187
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,650
at the peak of our competition,

188
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,390
the force wanted to form

189
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,050
a younger special operations force.

190
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,420
All the young officers
in the special force

191
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,930
signed up for the position

192
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,570
of captain.

193
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,610
<i>After many rounds of tests,</i>

194
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,270
<i>it was down to Luo Liang</i>

195
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,970
<i>and me.</i>

196
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,380
<i>How did it go?</i>

197
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,690
<i>I lost to him.</i>

198
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,430
Why didn't you attend

199
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,580
our first training this afternoon?

200
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,630
I was tired so I didn't want to go.

201
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,180
No matter how tired you are,
you're still the lieutenant.

202
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,730
Bond with the team and train warriors.

203
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,020
The entire brigade is watching us now.

204
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,810
No matter how tired you are,
you have to endure it.

205
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,950
In that case, I'll withdraw
from Team Thunder tomorrow.

206
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,930
I don't care who becomes the lieutenant.

207
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,440
Now that I'm Team Thunder's captain,

208
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,530
you are dissatisfied?

209
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,800
Answer me.

210
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,110
Yes, I am.

211
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,010
Didn't you see the test results?

212
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,000
What makes you captain? Tell me.

213
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,990
What makes you?

214
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,030
The way you're behaving now
says that I'm more worthy.

215
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,490
You're not fit to be
captain of Team Thunder.

216
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,859
You don't even have the basic qualities

217
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,050
of a soldier.

218
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,250
Shut up.

219
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,280
I don't need a lecture from you.
Get lost.

220
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,359
As a soldier,

221
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,819
you rise from where you fall

222
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,440
on the battlefield.

223
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,410
Taking things personal like this,

224
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,720
giving others your attitude
and giving up on yourself

225
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,210
make you a coward.

226
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,650
Do you feel better now?

227
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,250
Get up. Let's continue.

228
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,150
No.

229
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,770
You've already wasted a lot of energy
punching the sand bag today.

230
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,770
If we continue to fight,
I won't win fairly.

231
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,610
How are you so sure that you'll win?

232
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,590
We'll become rivals for a lifetime,
won't we?

233
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,370
There's still a long way to go.

234
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,770
We don't have to do this now.

235
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,400
The Brigade Captain told me that

236
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,730
you're a good sword.

237
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,810
But you still need to be sharpened.

238
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,570
It might do you good

239
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,130
that you're not captain.

240
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,890
Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,

241
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,900
gather for indoor close-quarters combat.

242
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm busy. You can proceed without me.

243
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,420
Don't you dare.

244
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,950
Sir.

245
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,430
Lieutenant of Team Thunder,

246
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,570
code name Whale, requests to return.

247
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,920
Fall in.

248
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,190
From today onwards,

249
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,370
not a single soldier here

250
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,400
will be left behind.

251
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,970
Do you hear me?

252
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,000
Only death will keep us apart.

253
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,260
Xiao Jun's mother said

254
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,540
you went on a mission together.

255
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,870
Yes.

256
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,290
We went on a mission together

257
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,430
but he didn't return.

258
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,690
He was the only one who didn't return.

259
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,810
As usual,

260
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,650
write your will and
the receiver's address.

261
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,290
Submit it before you disembark.

262
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,920
Captain, aren't you going to write one?

263
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,930
Meng Zhen doesn't want to do it. She said
she'll be waiting for me to go home.

264
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,290
Is she going to deliver soon?

265
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,290
One more month to go.

266
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,010
If I don't make it back,

267
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,580
you guys have to look after

268
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,410
the baby and her for me.

269
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,350
Don't worry.

270
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,450
Your son is also my son.

271
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,840
In your dreams!

272
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,950
Your parents are also my parents.

273
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,050
Your pet is also my pet.

274
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,050
Do you remember that poem we recited

275
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,770
during the joint activity?

276
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,190
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, Captain!

277
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,550
You start.

278
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,550
Yes, Captain.

279
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,080
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

280
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,970
Ready and go!

281
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,770
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

282
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,490
To war we are summoned,
So prep our weapon.

283
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,330
<i>We'll fight against one foe.
Why do you say I am bare?</i>

284
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,040
Why do you say I am bare?

285
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,030
Why do you say I am bare?

286

Are you okay?

288
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,790
I want some honey drink.

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
I'll go get it.

290
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,320
<i>Here you go. I made soup too.</i>

291
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,380
Sister-in-law, let me do it.

292
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,200
-How does it taste?
-It's delicious.

293
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,950
-You like the taste?
-It's so delicious.

294
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,380
-Eat more if you like it.
-It's so good.

295
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,130
Go help out in the kitchen.

296
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,250
Yes.

297
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,900
I have more coming up.

298
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,110
Don't tire yourself out.

299
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,430
Take a seat, sister-in-law.
I'll get them.

300
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,100
Alright.

301
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:18,780
Help me with this.

302
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,750
Give it to me.

303
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,510
-Put them here.
-I'll do it.

304
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,500
Take a seat.

305
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,220
This soup looks good. You made this?

306
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,840
Yes. It took me the whole afternoon.

307
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,050
Let me do it myself.
They're looking at us.

308
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,540
We are used to it already.

309
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,500
So what if they are looking?

310
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,060
I'm just being a good role model.

311
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,250
When they get married and have a family,

312
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,970
they must know how to love their wives.

313
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,730
Captain, teach me will do.

314
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,740
Our Lieutenant doesn't
need help with that.

315
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,610
After being admitted
into the military hospital,

316
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,680
he received a huge sack of love letters.

317
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,360
Food can't shut you up.

318
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,350
Are you envious?

319
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,980
Good for you, you little punk.

320
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,930
Nothing catches your heart
in that sack of love letters?

321
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,020
That's not it.
It's just that I'm still young.

322
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,250
I'm not in a hurry.

323
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,280
<i>You're not but I am.
Sister-in-law.

324
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,150
Can you introduce someone to me?

325
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,850
Sure. I'll match you up with someone.

326
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,160
What kind of girl do you like?

327
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm shy to say this but
I really don't ask for much.

328
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,950
As long as

329
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,510
she's as pretty as you.

330
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,150
Isn't that asking for too much?

331
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,930
How should I say this...

332
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,670
In order to meet my wife,

333
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,050
I gave up half of my life.

334
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,940
Great.

335
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,810
Captain Luo is talking

336
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,100
very weirdly today.

337
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm not used to it.

338
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,690
That's because I'm happy.

339
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm becoming a father soon.

340
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,250
This is a big news!

341
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,150
It's great news!

342
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,990
Here's to you, sister-in-law.

343
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,740
Alright.

344
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,330
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

345
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,450
I want to have a word with you two.

346
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,730
After this meal today,

347
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,620
I want you to really train yourself hard.

348
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,860
Not only train yourself,

349
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,170
but everyone in our team too.

350
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,690
We can't be all form but no substance.

351
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,510
We must demand of ourselves
actual combat standard

352
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,160
Don't go easy.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,860
Don't go soft. Don't be lenient.

354
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,800
I hope everyone

355
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,810
is sturdy and indestructible.

356
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,500
I hope everyone come back safely

357
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,250
after every mission.

358
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,170
I want to see results, not accidents.

359
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,840
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, Captain.

360
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,140
-Let's toast.
-Here.

361
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,020
Cheers to my wife. You've worked hard.

362
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,700
I just finished my work.

363
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,840
Place your order first.

364
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,470
Once I arrive, we can start eating.

365
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,640
I am sorry.

366
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,050
It's okay.

367
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,200
Is Zhuo Ran's family member here?

368
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,200
Yes.

369
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,890
-You're Zhuo Ran's kin?
-Yes.

370
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,040
Zhuo Ran?

371
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,150
That's right.

372
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,860
Patient experienced
ventricular tarchycardia.

373
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,340
We've checked the cardiac markers.

374
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,460
Myoglobin and troponin have
substantially increased.

375
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,570
Patient's condition has stabilised now,

376
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,910
but he's still unconscious.

377
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,370
I suspect that
it's a heart-related problem.

378
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,460
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?

379
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,940
Can you hear me?

380
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,090
Xia Chu.

381
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,990
Xia Chu.

382
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,300
Xia Chu.

383
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,490
He knows Xia Chu?

384
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,520
Xia Chu.

385
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,470
Did this happen before?

386
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,470
I'm not sure about that.

387
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,210
I just got to know him recently.

388
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,710
It's for work.

389
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,170
When this happened,
what was he doing?

390
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,300
Eating and talking.

391
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,870
Everything was normal?

392
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes.

393
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,260
While we were eating,

394
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,720
he received a phone call.

395
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,440
After that, his mood changed.

396
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,800
He passed out before I got a chance

397
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,030
to ask him what happened.

398
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,410
-Have you done the imaging test on him?
-Not yet.

399
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,540
Here's the thing.
Since his family member is not present,

400
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,450
we can only let the doctor decide about

401
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,010
his treatment plan.

402
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,170
As his friend,

403
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,900
can you sign the letter of permission?

404
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,970
-I can.
-Alright.

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,160
<i>Alright.</i>

423
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,010
Present?

424
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,670
What should I get her?

425
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,140
Have you found the origin of

426
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,520
the blue diamond on the cane?

427
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,550
Investigate it quick.

428
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,160
I can't leave.

429
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,580
He's still in the emergency room.
No one is here but me.

430
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,550
I have to accompany him.

431
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
You must be worried.

432
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm hanging up.

433
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,600
How is it? Is it serious?

434
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,440
We found a problem
based on his electrocardiogram.

435
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,570
However, it's not a typical
pattern of myocardial infarction.

436
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,190
We'll wait for
the cardiology doctor to arrive

437
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,060
and do a radiography
on his coronary artery.

438
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,620
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,810
There's an emergency here.

440
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,380
A patient in the emergency room
is in need of an operation.

441
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,010
I'm held up by the director.

442
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,110
Alright.

443
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,640
Okay. Let's meet up another time.

444
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,630
I am sorry for holding you up.

445
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,930
It's just a small matter.

446
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,290
Actually, I'm also a friend of Zhuo Ran.

447
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,330
But if you still feel bad about it,

448
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,690
you can add me on WeChat

449
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,650
as a consolation.

450
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,020
I'll scan your code.

451
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,990
Sure.

452
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,200
I'm Zhang Yi Chi, a cardio surgeon.

453
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,580
You are?

454
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,670
I'm Mi Gu.

455
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,670
Nice to meet you.

456
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,310
<i>Miss Mi Gu, what's the update
on your proposal?</i>

457
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,810
<i>The director is asking about it again.</i>

458
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,090
Good morning.

459
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,960
How did I fall asleep?

460
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,440
You'll have to ask yourself.

461
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,100
After I poured you
a cup of honey drink,

462
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,220
you were already fast asleep.

463
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,690
I couldn't even wake you up.

464
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,060
How do you feel?

465
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,160
Does it feel good to
sleep through the night?

466
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,740
Alright now, Captain Liang.
You should go wash up.

467
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,380
Come and have your breakfast
after you're done.

468
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,570
Start repenting later.

469
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,220
I made the yogurt and jam myself.

470
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,380
It's all natural.

471
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,010
Wholemeal slices and nuts

472
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,190
can protect your mucosa
and blood vessels that were damaged

473
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,780
after exposing to tear gas.

474
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,750
And of course,

475
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,650
this freshly-blended mixed fruits juice

476
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,690
that is rich in Vitamin C

477
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,040
and Vitamin B.

478
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,490
They work as a lubricant

479
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,060
to speed up the detoxification process.

480
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,450
The top choice for defeating poisoning.

481
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,250
A good day starts with good breakfast.

482
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,540
Let's do it, Captain Liang.

483
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,140
You were more adorable last night.

484
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,280
That's enough, Xia Chu.

485
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,340
I'm serious.

486
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,630
I thought

487
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,410
you lack emotion

488
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,720
and nothing can touch you heart.

489
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,860
But after listening to
what you said last night...

490
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,210
I didn't say anything.

491
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,680
Nothing at all.

492
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,640
Fine.

493
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,740
I made an appointment for you

494
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,130
with the psychiatrist in my hospital.

495
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,950
What?

496
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,690
Send me to work at nine o'clock today

497
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,930
and then go for your appointment.

498
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,750
I'm busy. I have training.

499
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,820
Isn't your training over?

500
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,810
I don't need to see a psychiatrist.

501
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,950
Of course you do.

502
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,130
Although you're from the special forces,
you're still a human.

503
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,130
If you want to sleep in peace at night...

504
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,910
Liang Mu Ze.

505
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,090
Look what I've got.

506
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,409
Meow. Let me take a look too.

507
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,330
Will you go now?

508
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,639
You're threatening me.

509
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,850
Yes.

510
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,150
Alright. I got it.

511
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,280
Dr Li, you want to see me?

512
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,320
The radiography report of the
patient who experienced

513
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,699
a sudden ventricular tachycardia is out.

514
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,699
He has been transferred
to cardiology ward?

515
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,020
There is no vacant bed yet.
I'll get him transferred

516
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,980
once someone gets discharged.

517
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,010
Okay.

518
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:02,640
I'll check at the emergency department.

519
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,970
Hold on.

520
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,370
You bailed on your parents again?

521
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,690
How did you know?

522
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,600
Your mother told me.

523
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,490
She wants me to remind you

524
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,410
to have your meals regularly.

525
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,550
I realised that you're
becoming more virtuous lately.

526
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,160
Men like women like that, don't they?

527
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,900
It seems like my effort

528
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,690
as training partner is not in vain.

529
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,570
You've grown up.

530
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,370
Of course I have to.

531
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,770
That's great.

532
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,010
Let's meet at the same place
this weekend. I'll be waiting for you.

533
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,130
Where is that?

534
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,290
You're awake. Are you feeling better?

535
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,640
Where is Xia Chu?

536
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,640
I haven't contacted her yet.

537
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,480
Do you want to eat something?

538
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,810
I'll go buy some food for you.

539
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,470
Can you get me a bottle of mineral water?

540
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,440
Okay, I'll buy you some porridge too.

541
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,890
You haven't eaten anything
the whole night.

542
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,870
You must be hungry.

543
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,160
There's a stall selling steamed buns
opposite the hospital.

544
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,450
The steamed buns are especially delicious.

545
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,970
I'll buy you some.

546
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,410
Thank you.

547
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,250
I'll be right back.

548
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,710
Seeing a psychiatrist

549
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,140
is not a big deal.

550
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,640
It's just like talking
to a hole in a tree.

551
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,790
Let me tell you this.

552
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,860
Human brains are

553
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,940
just like a container

554
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,820
filled with different emotions.

555
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,170
Sometimes, you'll have to empty it out.

556
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,030
If you don't,

557
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,770
it will explode.

558
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,540
I'm getting off now.

559
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,510
Liang Mu Ze,
you must attend the appointment.

560
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,670
You must.

561
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,890
You really must.

562
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,690
Make way please.

563
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,230
Xia Chu?

564
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,670
Xia Chu.

565
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,780
Mi Gu.

566
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,250
-Xia Chu.
-Mi Gu.

567
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,990
Xia Chu.

568
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,200
Mi...

569
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,050
-Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.
-What?

570
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,680
Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.

571
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,840
The radiograph of your left ventricle
and coronary artery

572
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,100
shows no sign of infarction.

573
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,250
We can eliminate the possibility of
myocardial infarction.

574
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,850
However, we've found that

575
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,590
at the apex of your heart,
most of the ventricles don't contract.

576
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,940
From the radiography, a swollen ventricle
that looked like a wilting octopus is seen

577
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,640
and the markers of myocardial damage

578
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,370
has started to increase.

579
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,140
It means

580
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,550
death of heart muscles.

581
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,250
Judging by your current condition,

582
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,810
I can say that the dizziness

583
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,970
and chest-pain is all due to

584
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,500
stress cardiomyopathy.

585
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,900
Stress cardiomyopathy?

586
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,730
You've always been healthy.

587
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,140
You even wanted to
get into a military school.

588
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,770
How can you have stress cardiomyopathy?

589
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,540
Xia Chu.

590
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,820
This condition

591
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,080
is usually caused by

592
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,520
intense emotional or physical stress.

593
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,660
For example,

594
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,030
a shock,

595
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,490
deep fear

596
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,770
or a sudden loss of a loved one

597
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,390
which can cause an epilepsy attack.

598
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,450
In your case, it's because
of a phone call.

599
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,880
I want to talk to Xia Chu

600
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,270
in private.

601
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,540
No problem.

602
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,700
Don't get worked up.

603
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,990
Do your ward rounds

604
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,690
-20 minutes later.
-Yes.

605
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,770
Liang Mu Ze.

606
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,570
Why are you here?

607
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,810
I'm looking for someone.

608
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,740
Is it Zhuo Ran?

609
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,730
No, Xia Chu.

610
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,400
Why is everyone asking for her today?

611
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,120
-Who else did?
-Director Zhang.

612
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,770
I just got a call
from Cardio Surgery Department.

613
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,700
They need you to check on ward 18.

614
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,310
Alright, I got it.

615
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,530
I'll get back to work now.

616
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,490
She is in that ward.

617
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,520
Go on.

618
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,730
I met Mi Gu just now.

619
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,380
She told me you're in the hospital.

620
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,560
She sent you here?

621
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,550
You were together last night?

622
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,630
What's with the phone call?

623
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,080
You have to tell me, Zhuo Ran.

624
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,600
What did you call me just now?

625
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,860
Zhuo Ran.

626
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,500
You still remember this person,

627
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,240
don't you?

628
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,160
Of course I do.

629
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,290
What are you saying?

630
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,450
You do remember.

631
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,030
You should also remember

632
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,650
those weekends you spent together,

633
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,280
those detective novels you read together,

634
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,450
the path you took together after school,

635
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,810
that bottle of water,

636
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,530
that diary

637
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,450
and the never-ending letters
you wrote each other.

638
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,610
All those memories

639
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,600
were your past with Zhuo Ran.

640
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,680
It's Zhuo Ran.

641
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,010
Xia Chu, it's Zhuo Ran.

642
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,150
It's Zhuo Ran.

643
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,650
Calm down, Zhuo Ran.

644
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,770
-You can't get up...
-This.

645
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,660
This part of me

646
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,640
almost stopped beating

647
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,020
just now.

648
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,130
It's because

649
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,860
I was sad

650
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,960
that you forgot Zhuo Ran.

651
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,860
I need to do my ward rounds now.
I'll visit you later.

652
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,960
That comrade...

653
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,170
Don't be with him.

654
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,580
Are you kidding me?

655
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,610
It can't be him.

656
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,880
Anyone can misunderstand
my relationship with him,

657
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,170
but not you.

658
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,960
For a very long time,

659
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,490
I can't even stand
hearing the words,

660
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,610
special force.

661
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,320
Let alone getting into a relationship.

662
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,640
You should know the reason.

663
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,100
Xia Chu.

664
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,510
Why are you here?

665
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,900
It was in the car?

666
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm so forgetful.

667
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,530
Sorry for causing you trouble.

668
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:14,990
Thank you.

669
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,830
Where are you going?

670
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,710
I'm going to visit Xiao Jun.

671
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,290
Have you seen the psychiatrist?

672
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,010
I am talking to you.

673
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,980
-No, I didn't.
-Why?

674
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,330
I don't want to.

675
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,210
Liang Mu Ze,
do you still want the photo?

676
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,770
It's up to you.

677
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,680
<i>Where are you?</i>
