00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>Episode 7</i>

4
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,190
Please enjoy the food.

5
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,280
About the show...

6
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,870
Currently, the form and content

7
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,880
have not been confirmed yet.

8
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,940
If you have any ideas,

9
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,520
feel free to tell me anytime.

10
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,920
Of course,

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
throughout the recording process,

12
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,740
we'll also fully respect your opinions.

13
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,020
-About the...
-How did you know Xia Chu?

14
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,670
We started as Internet friends.

15
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,810
I found an article

16
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,810
she wrote on the Internet

17
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,960
about her first love.

18
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,560
At that time,

19
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,040
I was about to graduate from university.

20
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,090
I couldn't find a job yet.

21
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,590
Quota for postgraduate studies
had all been filled up.

22
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,810
My boyfriend wanted to break up with me.

23
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,290
I was extremely depressed.

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,670
But after reading her article,

25
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,860
I was inspired.

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,580
I replied to her article.

27
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,840
Then, we started texting
each other on WeChat.

28
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,080
Later on, we arranged a meet-up.

29
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,690
It's kind of weird.

30
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,010
Although our age gap

31
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,380
is quite big

32
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,380
and our personalities are so different,

33
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,490
but somehow we had

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,470
endless topics to talk about
every time we meet.

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,650
Maybe it's because

36
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,370
we are both brilliant individuals

37
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,040
and role models of outstanding
contemporary young women?

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,540
Hence we empathize and admire each other.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,810
Did she ever mention to you about...

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,620
You?

41
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,070
Yes.

42
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,310
Me.

43
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,610
Of course she did.

44
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,660
She told me a lot

45
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,370
about your past with her.

46
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,430
What happened after that?

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,590
Was she in a new relationship?

48
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,930
She had a relationship
during her university years

49
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,830
but it ended very soon.

50
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,550
She was too busy.

51
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,630
Too busy?

52
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,210
Perhaps it was because she was too busy.

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,490
Perhaps it was because of other reasons.

54
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,470
Perhaps it was because of you.

55
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,640
What do you want to know?

56
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,130
<i>Long Yi</i>

57
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,640
Please excuse me.

58
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,480
<i>His name is Liang Mu Ze.</i>

59
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,800
<i>He's from the Special Forces.</i>

60
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,850
<i>Now an army major.</i>

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,620
<i>Xia Chu is close to him.</i>

62
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,820
<i>They're living in together now.</i>

63
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,300
I got it.

64
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,150
It's fine.

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,370
You should get going if you're busy.
Don't worry about me.

66
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,200
It's him.

67
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,840
It's really him.

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,810
Are you okay?

69
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,270
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,060
Please clear the front.

71
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,530
Make way, please.

72
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,380
Please make way.

73
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,470
I'm sorry. You have to wait outside.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
<i>Military and Police Take Down Drug Den</i>

75
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,600
Cheers to our final night together.

76
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,360
Is everyone ready?

77
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,500
This is the final test
of this military training program,

78
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,250
namely the endurance test.

79
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,240
It's the ultimate test of your willpower.

80
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,260
As soon as someone touches the tear gas,

81
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,920
I'll start the timer.

82
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,440
The test ends when each individual
leaves this room

83
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,190
and marks will be added
into your final scores.

84
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,600
In other words,

85
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,190
as long as you stay
in this room long enough,

86
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,230
you can still catch up with the scores
although you were behind?

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,230
That's right.

88
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,830
Good luck to everyone.

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,730
It's going to be a tough one today.

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,380
Liang Mu Ze.

91
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,780
You'll put the tear gas

92
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,420
-into the pot.
-Okay.

93
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,540
Let's make a deal first.

94
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,180
Whoever leaves this room first

95
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,140
will buy everyone a meal.

96
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,010
-Sure.
-No problem.

97
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,640
Liang Mu Ze.

98
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,920
How could you start
without telling us first?

99
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,450
I'm going all out.

100
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,260
I really want to know

101
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,260
if you were ever defeated before

102
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,210
all these years in the force.

103
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,240
Of course he was.

104
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,730
I'll take him down today.

105
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,510
I want to know

106
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,960
who that legend is.

107
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,570
I must meet him.

108
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,090
You can't meet him anymore.

109
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,360
He died in service.

110
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,330
If it wasn't for him,

111
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,590
I wouldn't be sitting here alive today.

112
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,590
This is wrong.

113
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,700
What did you say?

114
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,410
You should walk ahead of me.

115
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,820
Is there a difference?

116
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,050
It'll be the right direction
when you walk ahead of me.

117
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,480
Following you keeps me steady.

118
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,870
It has been eight years, Mu Ze.

119
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,980
You don't have to walk in my footsteps.

120
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,200
I need to.

121
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,320
To others,

122
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,160
many things may change in eight years.

123
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,420
But to me,

124
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,080
you'll always be my captain.

125
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,520
The patient is experiencing
ventricular tachycardia.

126
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,300
Get the defibrillator.

127
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,890
IV infusion, 100 mg of lidocaine.

128
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,720
Heart rate is back to normal.

129
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,730
Why did you drink so much today?

130
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,100
Don't you have to
return to the force tomorrow?

131
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,750
Stop drinking. It's bad for your stomach.

132
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,770
Tomorrow is an off day.

133
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,440
You cried?

134
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,470
Tear gas.

135
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,800
My head hurts.

136
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,610
I'll make you honey drink to sober up.

137
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,060
Sit down and talk with me.

138
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,370
Today is the anniversary of

139
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,250
Luo Liang's death.

140
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,020
Luo Liang?

141
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,070
Yes.

142
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,760
Xiao Jun's father.

143
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,930
You were right.

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,230
Eight years have passed.

145
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,280
But I still think he is here.

146
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,850
He is still by my side

147
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,610
and in my life.

148
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,790
Sometimes when I'm in my dreams

149
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,970
or when I had too much to drink,

150
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,120
I'll want to talk to him.

151
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,380
I can't believe and accept the fact that

152
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,260
he has totally disappeared

153
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,730
from my life.

154
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,970
I can't accept it.

155
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,010
<i>Luo Liang and I</i>

156
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,530
<i>majored in Special Forces
Military Training.</i>

157
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,050
<i>We joined the Special Forces Brigade
after we graduated.</i>

158
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,090
<i>Like our Brigade Captain Dong Zhi Gang
always said,</i>

159
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,710
<i>"When two similar sharp edges</i>

160
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,370
<i>with the same shine meet,</i>

161
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,530
<i>sparks will fly</i>

162
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,890
<i>when they collide."</i>

163
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,850
<i>We graduated the same year,</i>

164
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,810
<i>served under the same force,</i>

165
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,850
<i>and became platoon sergeants.</i>

166
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,960
<i>Everything was a competition between us.</i>

167
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,270
<i>We competed in our trainings</i>

168
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,630
<i>and shooting skills.</i>

169
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,700
Start!

170
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,860
-Beat him!
-You can do it!

171
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,470
<i>Even in the activity room
during break time,</i>

172
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,300
<i>we competed in</i>

173
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,610
<i>arm wrestling.</i>

174
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,620
You can do it!

175
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,210
You can do it!

176
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,930
<i>Those were the days in the force.</i>

177
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,890
<i>Everything was a competition.</i>

178
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,760
<i>There must be a winner
and loser in everything.</i>

179
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,050
<i>Everyone gave his very best.</i>

180
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,830
Being passionate in everything
was the law of survival in the force.

181
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,970
It was also a special way of expressing

182
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,600
the friendship between Luo Liang and me.

183
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,050
At that time, comrades in the force

184
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,290
would call us

185
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,920
military elites who are equally matched.

186
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,010
When we were

187
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,850
at the peak of our competition,

188
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,590
the force wanted to form

189
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,250
a younger special operations force.

190
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,620
All the young officers
in the special force

191
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,130
signed up for the position

192
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,770
of captain.

193
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,810
<i>After many rounds of tests,</i>

194
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,470
<i>it was down to Luo Liang</i>

195
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,170
<i>and me.</i>

196
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,580
<i>How did it go?</i>

197
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,890
<i>I lost to him.</i>

198
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,630
Why didn't you attend

199
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,780
our first training this afternoon?

200
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,830
I was tired so I didn't want to go.

201
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,380
No matter how tired you are,
you're still the lieutenant.

202
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,930
Bond with the team and train warriors.

203
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,220
The entire brigade is watching us now.

204
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,010
No matter how tired you are,
you have to endure it.

205
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,150
In that case, I'll withdraw
from Team Thunder tomorrow.

206
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,130
I don't care who becomes the lieutenant.

207
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,640
Now that I'm Team Thunder's captain,

208
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,730
you are dissatisfied?

209
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Answer me.

210
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,310
Yes, I am.

211
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,210
Didn't you see the test results?

212
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,200
What makes you captain? Tell me.

213
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,190
What makes you?

214
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,230
The way you're behaving now
says that I'm more worthy.

215
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,690
You're not fit to be
captain of Team Thunder.

216
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,059
You don't even have the basic qualities

217
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,250
of a soldier.

218
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,450
Shut up.

219
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,480
I don't need a lecture from you.
Get lost.

220
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,559
As a soldier,

221
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,019
you rise from where you fall

222
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,640
on the battlefield.

223
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,610
Taking things personal like this,

224
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,920
giving others your attitude
and giving up on yourself

225
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,410
make you a coward.

226
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,850
Do you feel better now?

227
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,450
Get up. Let's continue.

228
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,350
No.

229
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,970
You've already wasted a lot of energy
punching the sand bag today.

230
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,970
If we continue to fight,
I won't win fairly.

231
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,810
How are you so sure that you'll win?

232
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,790
We'll become rivals for a lifetime,
won't we?

233
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,570
There's still a long way to go.

234
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,970
We don't have to do this now.

235
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,600
The Brigade Captain told me that

236
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,930
you're a good sword.

237
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,010
But you still need to be sharpened.

238
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,770
It might do you good

239
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,330
that you're not captain.

240
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,090
Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,

241
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,100
gather for indoor close-quarters combat.

242
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm busy. You can proceed without me.

243
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,620
Don't you dare.

244
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,150
Sir.

245
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,630
Lieutenant of Team Thunder,

246
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,770
code name Whale, requests to return.

247
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,120
Fall in.

248
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,390
From today onwards,

249
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,570
not a single soldier here

250
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,600
will be left behind.

251
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,170
Do you hear me?

252
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,200
Only death will keep us apart.

253
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,460
Xiao Jun's mother said

254
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,740
you went on a mission together.

255
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,070
Yes.

256
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,490
We went on a mission together

257
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,630
but he didn't return.

258
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,890
He was the only one who didn't return.

259
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,010
As usual,

260
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,850
write your will and
the receiver's address.

261
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,490
Submit it before you disembark.

262
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,120
Captain, aren't you going to write one?

263
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,130
Meng Zhen doesn't want to do it. She said
she'll be waiting for me to go home.

264
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,490
Is she going to deliver soon?

265
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,490
One more month to go.

266
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,210
If I don't make it back,

267
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,780
you guys have to look after

268
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,610
the baby and her for me.

269
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,550
Don't worry.

270
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,650
Your son is also my son.

271
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,040
In your dreams!

272
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,150
Your parents are also my parents.

273
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,250
Your pet is also my pet.

274
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,250
Do you remember that poem we recited

275
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,970
during the joint activity?

276
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,390
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, Captain!

277
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,750
You start.

278
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,750
Yes, Captain.

279
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,280
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

280
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,170
Ready and go!

281
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,970
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

282
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,690
To war we are summoned,
So prep our weapon.

283
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,530
<i>We'll fight against one foe.
Why do you say I am bare?</i>

284
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,240
Why do you say I am bare?

285
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,230
Why do you say I am bare?

286

Are you okay?

288
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,990
I want some honey drink.

289
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,200
I'll go get it.

290
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,520
<i>Here you go. I made soup too.</i>

291
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,580
Sister-in-law, let me do it.

292
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,400
-How does it taste?
-It's delicious.

293
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,150
-You like the taste?
-It's so delicious.

294
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,580
-Eat more if you like it.
-It's so good.

295
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,330
Go help out in the kitchen.

296
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,450
Yes.

297
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,100
I have more coming up.

298
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,310
Don't tire yourself out.

299
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,630
Take a seat, sister-in-law.
I'll get them.

300
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,300
Alright.

301
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,980
Help me with this.

302
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,950
Give it to me.

303
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,710
-Put them here.
-I'll do it.

304
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,700
Take a seat.

305
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,420
This soup looks good. You made this?

306
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,040
Yes. It took me the whole afternoon.

307
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,250
Let me do it myself.
They're looking at us.

308
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,740
We are used to it already.

309
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,700
So what if they are looking?

310
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,260
I'm just being a good role model.

311
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,450
When they get married and have a family,

312
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,170
they must know how to love their wives.

313
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,930
Captain, teach me will do.

314
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,940
Our Lieutenant doesn't
need help with that.

315
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,810
After being admitted
into the military hospital,

316
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,880
he received a huge sack of love letters.

317
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,560
Food can't shut you up.

318
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,550
Are you envious?

319
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,180
Good for you, you little punk.

320
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,130
Nothing catches your heart
in that sack of love letters?

321
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,220
That's not it.
It's just that I'm still young.

322
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,450
I'm not in a hurry.

323
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,480
<i>You're not but I am.
Sister-in-law.

324
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,350
Can you introduce someone to me?

325
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,050
Sure. I'll match you up with someone.

326
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,360
What kind of girl do you like?

327
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,800
I'm shy to say this but
I really don't ask for much.

328
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,150
As long as

329
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,710
she's as pretty as you.

330
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,350
Isn't that asking for too much?

331
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,130
How should I say this...

332
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,870
In order to meet my wife,

333
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,250
I gave up half of my life.

334
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,140
Great.

335
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,010
Captain Luo is talking

336
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,300
very weirdly today.

337
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,620
I'm not used to it.

338
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,890
That's because I'm happy.

339
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm becoming a father soon.

340
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,450
This is a big news!

341
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,350
It's great news!

342
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,190
Here's to you, sister-in-law.

343
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,940
Alright.

344
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,530
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

345
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,650
I want to have a word with you two.

346
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,930
After this meal today,

347
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,820
I want you to really train yourself hard.

348
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,060
Not only train yourself,

349
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,370
but everyone in our team too.

350
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,890
We can't be all form but no substance.

351
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,710
We must demand of ourselves
actual combat standard

352
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,360
Don't go easy.

353
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,060
Don't go soft. Don't be lenient.

354
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,000
I hope everyone

355
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,010
is sturdy and indestructible.

356
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,700
I hope everyone come back safely

357
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,450
after every mission.

358
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,370
I want to see results, not accidents.

359
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,040
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, Captain.

360
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,340
-Let's toast.
-Here.

361
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,220
Cheers to my wife. You've worked hard.

362
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,900
I just finished my work.

363
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,040
Place your order first.

364
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,670
Once I arrive, we can start eating.

365
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,840
I am sorry.

366
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,250
It's okay.

367
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,400
Is Zhuo Ran's family member here?

368
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,400
Yes.

369
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,090
-You're Zhuo Ran's kin?
-Yes.

370
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,240
Zhuo Ran?

371
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,350
That's right.

372
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,060
Patient experienced
ventricular tarchycardia.

373
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,540
We've checked the cardiac markers.

374
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,660
Myoglobin and troponin have
substantially increased.

375
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,770
Patient's condition has stabilised now,

376
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,110
but he's still unconscious.

377
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,570
I suspect that
it's a heart-related problem.

378
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,660
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?

379
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,140
Can you hear me?

380
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,290
Xia Chu.

381
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,190
Xia Chu.

382
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,500
Xia Chu.

383
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,690
He knows Xia Chu?

384
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,720
Xia Chu.

385
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,670
Did this happen before?

386
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,670
I'm not sure about that.

387
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,410
I just got to know him recently.

388
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,910
It's for work.

389
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,370
When this happened,
what was he doing?

390
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,500
Eating and talking.

391
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,070
Everything was normal?

392
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,880
Yes.

393
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,460
While we were eating,

394
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,920
he received a phone call.

395
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,640
After that, his mood changed.

396
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,000
He passed out before I got a chance

397
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,230
to ask him what happened.

398
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,610
-Have you done the imaging test on him?
-Not yet.

399
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,740
Here's the thing.
Since his family member is not present,

400
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,650
we can only let the doctor decide about

401
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,210
his treatment plan.

402
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,370
As his friend,

403
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,100
can you sign the letter of permission?

404
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,170
-I can.
-Alright.

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,360
<i>Alright.</i>

423
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,210
Present?

424
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,870
What should I get her?

425
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,340
Have you found the origin of

426
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,720
the blue diamond on the cane?

427
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,750
Investigate it quick.

428
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,360
I can't leave.

429
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,780
He's still in the emergency room.
No one is here but me.

430
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,750
I have to accompany him.

431
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
You must be worried.

432
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm hanging up.

433
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,800
How is it? Is it serious?

434
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,640
We found a problem
based on his electrocardiogram.

435
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,770
However, it's not a typical
pattern of myocardial infarction.

436
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,390
We'll wait for
the cardiology doctor to arrive

437
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,260
and do a radiography
on his coronary artery.

438
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,820
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,010
There's an emergency here.

440
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,580
A patient in the emergency room
is in need of an operation.

441
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,210
I'm held up by the director.

442
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,310
Alright.

443
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,840
Okay. Let's meet up another time.

444
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,830
I am sorry for holding you up.

445
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,130
It's just a small matter.

446
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,490
Actually, I'm also a friend of Zhuo Ran.

447
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,530
But if you still feel bad about it,

448
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,890
you can add me on WeChat

449
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,850
as a consolation.

450
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,220
I'll scan your code.

451
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,190
Sure.

452
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm Zhang Yi Chi, a cardio surgeon.

453
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,780
You are?

454
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,870
I'm Mi Gu.

455
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,870
Nice to meet you.

456
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,510
<i>Miss Mi Gu, what's the update
on your proposal?</i>

457
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>The director is asking about it again.</i>

458
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,290
Good morning.

459
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,160
How did I fall asleep?

460
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,640
You'll have to ask yourself.

461
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,300
After I poured you
a cup of honey drink,

462
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,420
you were already fast asleep.

463
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,890
I couldn't even wake you up.

464
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,260
How do you feel?

465
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,360
Does it feel good to
sleep through the night?

466
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,940
Alright now, Captain Liang.
You should go wash up.

467
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,580
Come and have your breakfast
after you're done.

468
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,770
Start repenting later.

469
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,420
I made the yogurt and jam myself.

470
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,580
It's all natural.

471
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,210
Wholemeal slices and nuts

472
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,390
can protect your mucosa
and blood vessels that were damaged

473
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,980
after exposing to tear gas.

474
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,950
And of course,

475
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,850
this freshly-blended mixed fruits juice

476
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,890
that is rich in Vitamin C

477
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,240
and Vitamin B.

478
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,690
They work as a lubricant

479
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,260
to speed up the detoxification process.

480
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,650
The top choice for defeating poisoning.

481
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,450
A good day starts with good breakfast.

482
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,740
Let's do it, Captain Liang.

483
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,340
You were more adorable last night.

484
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,480
That's enough, Xia Chu.

485
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,540
I'm serious.

486
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,830
I thought

487
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,610
you lack emotion

488
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,920
and nothing can touch you heart.

489
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,060
But after listening to
what you said last night...

490
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,410
I didn't say anything.

491
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,880
Nothing at all.

492
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,840
Fine.

493
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,940
I made an appointment for you

494
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,330
with the psychiatrist in my hospital.

495
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,150
What?

496
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,890
Send me to work at nine o'clock today

497
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,130
and then go for your appointment.

498
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,950
I'm busy. I have training.

499
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,020
Isn't your training over?

500
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,010
I don't need to see a psychiatrist.

501
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,150
Of course you do.

502
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,330
Although you're from the special forces,
you're still a human.

503
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,330
If you want to sleep in peace at night...

504
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,110
Liang Mu Ze.

505
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:17,290
Look what I've got.

506
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,609
Meow. Let me take a look too.

507
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,530
Will you go now?

508
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,839
You're threatening me.

509
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,050
Yes.

510
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,350
Alright. I got it.

511
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,480
Dr Li, you want to see me?

512
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,520
The radiography report of the
patient who experienced

513
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:52,899
a sudden ventricular tachycardia is out.

514
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,899
He has been transferred
to cardiology ward?

515
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,220
There is no vacant bed yet.
I'll get him transferred

516
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,180
once someone gets discharged.

517
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,210
Okay.

518
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:02,840
I'll check at the emergency department.

519
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,170
Hold on.

520
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,570
You bailed on your parents again?

521
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,890
How did you know?

522
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,800
Your mother told me.

523
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,690
She wants me to remind you

524
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,610
to have your meals regularly.

525
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,750
I realised that you're
becoming more virtuous lately.

526
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,360
Men like women like that, don't they?

527
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,100
It seems like my effort

528
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,890
as training partner is not in vain.

529
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,770
You've grown up.

530
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,570
Of course I have to.

531
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,970
That's great.

532
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,210
Let's meet at the same place
this weekend. I'll be waiting for you.

533
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,330
Where is that?

534
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,490
You're awake. Are you feeling better?

535
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,840
Where is Xia Chu?

536
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,840
I haven't contacted her yet.

537
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,680
Do you want to eat something?

538
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,010
I'll go buy some food for you.

539
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,670
Can you get me a bottle of mineral water?

540
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,640
Okay, I'll buy you some porridge too.

541
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,090
You haven't eaten anything
the whole night.

542
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,070
You must be hungry.

543
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,360
There's a stall selling steamed buns
opposite the hospital.

544
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,650
The steamed buns are especially delicious.

545
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,170
I'll buy you some.

546
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,610
Thank you.

547
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,450
I'll be right back.

548
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,910
Seeing a psychiatrist

549
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,340
is not a big deal.

550
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,840
It's just like talking
to a hole in a tree.

551
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,990
Let me tell you this.

552
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,060
Human brains are

553
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,140
just like a container

554
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,020
filled with different emotions.

555
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,370
Sometimes, you'll have to empty it out.

556
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,230
If you don't,

557
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,970
it will explode.

558
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,740
I'm getting off now.

559
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,710
Liang Mu Ze,
you must attend the appointment.

560
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,870
You must.

561
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,090
You really must.

562
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,890
Make way please.

563
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,430
Xia Chu?

564
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,870
Xia Chu.

565
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,980
Mi Gu.

566
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,450
-Xia Chu.
-Mi Gu.

567
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,190
Xia Chu.

568
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,400
Mi...

569
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,250
-Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.
-What?

570
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,880
Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.

571
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,040
The radiograph of your left ventricle
and coronary artery

572
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,300
shows no sign of infarction.

573
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,450
We can eliminate the possibility of
myocardial infarction.

574
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,050
However, we've found that

575
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,790
at the apex of your heart,
most of the ventricles don't contract.

576
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,140
From the radiography, a swollen ventricle
that looked like a wilting octopus is seen

577
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,840
and the markers of myocardial damage

578
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,570
has started to increase.

579
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,340
It means

580
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,750
death of heart muscles.

581
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,450
Judging by your current condition,

582
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,010
I can say that the dizziness

583
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,170
and chest-pain is all due to

584
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,700
stress cardiomyopathy.

585
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,100
Stress cardiomyopathy?

586
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,930
You've always been healthy.

587
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,340
You even wanted to
get into a military school.

588
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,970
How can you have stress cardiomyopathy?

589
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,740
Xia Chu.

590
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,020
This condition

591
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,280
is usually caused by

592
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,720
intense emotional or physical stress.

593
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:28,860
For example,

594
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,230
a shock,

595
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,690
deep fear

596
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,970
or a sudden loss of a loved one

597
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,590
which can cause an epilepsy attack.

598
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,650
In your case, it's because
of a phone call.

599
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,080
I want to talk to Xia Chu

600
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,470
in private.

601
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,740
No problem.

602
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,900
Don't get worked up.

603
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,190
Do your ward rounds

604
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,890
-20 minutes later.
-Yes.

605
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,970
Liang Mu Ze.

606
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,770
Why are you here?

607
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,010
I'm looking for someone.

608
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,940
Is it Zhuo Ran?

609
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,930
No, Xia Chu.

610
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,600
Why is everyone asking for her today?

611
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,320
-Who else did?
-Director Zhang.

612
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,970
I just got a call
from Cardio Surgery Department.

613
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,900
They need you to check on ward 18.

614
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,510
Alright, I got it.

615
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,730
I'll get back to work now.

616
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,690
She is in that ward.

617
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,720
Go on.

618
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,930
I met Mi Gu just now.

619
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,580
She told me you're in the hospital.

620
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,760
She sent you here?

621
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,750
You were together last night?

622
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,830
What's with the phone call?

623
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,280
You have to tell me, Zhuo Ran.

624
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,800
What did you call me just now?

625
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,060
Zhuo Ran.

626
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,700
You still remember this person,

627
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
don't you?

628
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,360
Of course I do.

629
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,490
What are you saying?

630
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,650
You do remember.

631
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,230
You should also remember

632
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,850
those weekends you spent together,

633
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,480
those detective novels you read together,

634
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,650
the path you took together after school,

635
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,010
that bottle of water,

636
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,730
that diary

637
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,650
and the never-ending letters
you wrote each other.

638
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,810
All those memories

639
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,800
were your past with Zhuo Ran.

640
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,880
It's Zhuo Ran.

641
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,210
Xia Chu, it's Zhuo Ran.

642
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,350
It's Zhuo Ran.

643
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,850
Calm down, Zhuo Ran.

644
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,970
-You can't get up...
-This.

645
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,860
This part of me

646
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,840
almost stopped beating

647
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,220
just now.

648
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,330
It's because

649
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,060
I was sad

650
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,160
that you forgot Zhuo Ran.

651
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,060
I need to do my ward rounds now.
I'll visit you later.

652
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,160
That comrade...

653
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,370
Don't be with him.

654
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,780
Are you kidding me?

655
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,810
It can't be him.

656
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,080
Anyone can misunderstand
my relationship with him,

657
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,370
but not you.

658
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,160
For a very long time,

659
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,690
I can't even stand
hearing the words,

660
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,810
special force.

661
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,520
Let alone getting into a relationship.

662
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,840
You should know the reason.

663
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,300
Xia Chu.

664
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,710
Why are you here?

665
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,100
It was in the car?

666
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,040
I'm so forgetful.

667
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,730
Sorry for causing you trouble.

668
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,190
Thank you.

669
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,030
Where are you going?

670
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,910
I'm going to visit Xiao Jun.

671
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,490
Have you seen the psychiatrist?

672
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,210
I am talking to you.

673
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,180
-No, I didn't.
-Why?

674
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,530
I don't want to.

675
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,410
Liang Mu Ze,
do you still want the photo?

676
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,970
It's up to you.

677
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,880
<i>Where are you?</i>
