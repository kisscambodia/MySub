00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>Episode 3</i>

4
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:47,870
Meng Zhen.

5
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,390
Dr Xia.

6
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,630
I just finished rounding.

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,989
How is the result?

8
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,709
This is the echocardiography report.

9
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,989
The doctor said it's atrial septal defect

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,030
and made us handle the hospitalisation
procedure.

11
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,900
Where's Liang Mu Ze?

12
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,190
Mu Ze didn't come
as he has work to do today.

13
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,310
It's the same with the doctor here.

14
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,270
Why are they the same?

15
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,270
It's not what I meant.

16
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,429
Dr Xia, is something wrong?

17
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,260
One second.

18
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,230
Okay.

19
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,630
Okay, I'll be right there.

20
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,940
Dr Xia,

21
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:29,110
is something wrong
with Xiao Jun's condition?

22
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,380
How about this?

23
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,310
Let me keep this report.

24
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,790
You go and register
for admission first.

25
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,860
I'll see you at the ward

26
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,910
when I finish my work.

27
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,260
Okay.

28
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,430
I don't want to get admitted.

29
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,470
Xiao Jun.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,070
Xiao Jun, be a good boy.

31
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,750
You can return home

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,070
after getting well.

33
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,230
I'm not sick.

34
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,390
Xiao Jun!

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,950
What are you doing?

36
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,380
It's all because of you

37
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,870
that Liang Mu Ze doesn't want us!

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,470
Luo Xiao Jun, watch your words!

39
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,710
You've become very rude!

40
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,830
Dr Xia, I'm sorry.

41
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,590
Something is wrong with him today.

42
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,070
Please don't mind him.

43
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,900
It's all right.

44
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,470
Hurry up and register for the admission.

45
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,670
Okay.

46
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,470
Let's go. What's wrong with you?

47
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,340
Enough.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,430
Xiao Jun, let me tell you.

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,900
You can't be rude

50
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,100
to the elderly,

51
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,070
understand?

52
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,660
I don't want to be hospitalised.

53
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,790
Ask Liang Mu Ze to come to pick us up.

54
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,790
I want to see Liang Mu Ze.

55
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,380
You must behave.

56
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:30,910
Wait for me.

57
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,670
Hello, we're here
to register for admission.

58
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,460
Mr Zhang,

59
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,860
let me assist in your surgery.

60
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,350
I'm well-prepared.

61
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,230
Have you sent the patients'
medical reports?

62
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,390
I've finished sending them.

63
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,430
Dr Zhang,

64
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,190
Tian Yong's wound has recovered well.

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,510
I've changed the dressing for him.

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,700
Tell him to return and recuperate.

67
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,950
Regular inspection will do.

68
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,390
Dr Zhang,

69
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,590
are you close

70
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,270
with Dr Li Juan
from the cardiology department?

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,620
Just say it.

72
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,590
What's the matter?

73
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,900
She just admitted a patient,

74
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,779
named Luo Xiao Jun.

75
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,470
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

76
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,630
I suspect it's not a simple
atrial septal defect.

77
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,550
Some adjustments might need to be made

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,740
on the previous
interventional surgical plan.

79
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,790
This is his echocardiography report.

80
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,230
Did the cardiology department
request a cardio surgery consultation?

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,310
No.

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,060
In fact, Dr Li Juan

83
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,909
didn't perform further tests on him.

84
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,670
Then what do you want me to do?

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,990
Can you take a look at him?

86
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,630
He is a patient
the cardiology department admitted.

87
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,310
They didn't request our consultation.

88
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,350
We can't step in.

89
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,380
But...

90
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,630
This is the hospital policy.

91
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,870
Enough, I've got a surgery.

92
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,630
No, Dr Zhang.

93
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,630
Don't follow me.

94
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:42,380
I had a chance to convince him

95
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,950
to let me join the surgery.

96
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,660
Meng Zhen,

97
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,380
hang on, I'll be right there.

98
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,630
<i>No, Dr Xia.</i>

99
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,030
<i>Xiao Jun is missing.</i>

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,590
What?

101
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,230
This is Xiao Jun, right?

102
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,350
He left on his own?

103
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,550
It's fortunate

104
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,470
that he wasn't abducted.

105
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,740
This brat!

106
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,310
Where will he go?

107
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,750
Did he say anything

108
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,070
to you before leaving?

109
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,060
It's the same thing.

110
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,980
He said he didn't want to get admitted.

111
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,030
And that he wanted to see Liang Mu Ze.

112
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,750
Liang Mu Ze?

113
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,910
Yes.

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,630
Did you call him?

115
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,310
I did, but he didn't answer the phone.

116
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,870
I guess he's on a mission

117
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,190
or he might be training.

118
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,590
Don't worry.

119
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,580
How about this?

120
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,950
You search nearby the hospital.

121
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,790
I'll contact Liang Mu Ze.

122
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,350
Xiao Jun might go look for him.

123
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,670
Okay.

124
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,940
Lieutenant Tian!

125
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,820
Yes!

126
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,790
Hello, Dr Xia!

127
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,910
Great! You haven't left!

128
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,750
Is Liang Mu Ze on a mission?

129
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,310
I don't know.

130
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,350
Xiao Jun is missing.

131
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,900
He might go to the unit for him.

132
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,150
Hurry up and return to the unit!

133
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,980
If you see Liang Mu Ze,

134
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,230
you must tell him this news.

135
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,830
If you don't see him, you must be mindful.

136
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,260
If Xiao Jun really went to the unit,

137
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,390
bring him back immediately.

138
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,310
This child suffers from severe
congenital heart disease.

139
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,110
He needs to be hospitalised immediately.

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,860
His life would be in danger

141
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,310
if things went wrong, got it?

142
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,150
This time the operation

143
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,190
was not perfect.

144
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,870
We almost got trapped by the enemy.

145
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,110
This is fatal

146
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,590
for the special forces!

147
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,870
It's a disgrace!

148
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,020
There's always one way

149
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,430
to cleanse our shame!

150
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,750
Thunderbolt is invincible!

151
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,300
Kill them all!

152
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,310
I heard it from Xiao Wu

153
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,630
that you've taken two bottles
of sleeping pills

154
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,390
from the infirmary during this time.

155
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,750
Yes.

156
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,390
I lost

157
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,790
the previous bottle.

158
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,950
Did you lose it

159
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:45,990
or you finished it?

160
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,109
I lost it

161
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,830
or they hid it from me.

162
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,150
Your insomnia gets worse

163
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,190
every time you lose a comrade
or when there are

164
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,750
some flaws in the operation.

165
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,910
And then,

166
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,550
you train yourself like a maniac.

167
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,630
Because I'm angry.

168
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,270
Or are you scared?

169
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,510
I scare nothing.

170
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,990
It's been eight years, Mu Ze.

171
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,030
Don't force yourself too much.

172
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,790
I'm fine, Brigade Commander!

173
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,150
Good.

174
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,150
Salute!

175
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,260
Report to Brigade Commander!

176
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,230
Tian Yong has returned!

177
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,870
Get some rest.

178
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,940
Thank you, Brigade Commander.

179
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,910
Captain,

180
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,190
is Xiao Jun here?

181
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,310
No.

182
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,310
Why would Xiao Jun be here?

183
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,910
He is missing.

184
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,950
Missing?

185
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,590
Luo Xiao Jun?

186
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,790
Luo Xiao Jun?

187
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,190
Luo Xiao Jun?

188
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,830
He is not here!

189
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,510
I've searched
all the places where he could go.

190
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,070
This kid is really...

191
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,470
Where did he go?

192
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,270
He's here.

193
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,630
Xiao Jun.

194
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,430
What's wrong? Xiao Jun.

195
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,270
Xiao Jun, what's going on?

196
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,300
Don't scare me, Xiao Jun!

197
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,710
Xiao Jun!

198
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,870
I saw Dad.

199
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,950
Xiao Jun! Xiao Jun!

200
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,030
Xiao Jun!

201
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,390
-Xiao Jun! Wake up!
-Let's send him to the hospital.

202
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,710
Come in.

203
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,350
Dr Li,

204
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,110
I'm Xia Chu,
a resident of Cardio Surgery.

205
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,990
Can I help you?

206
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,710
You admitted a boy, named Luo Xiao Jun,

207
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,100
with a suspected atrial septal defect

208
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,910
in the morning.

209
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,110
Do you remember him?

210
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,830
I do.

211
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,390
What's the matter?

212
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,190
I would like

213
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,310
to ask your advice about this case.

214
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,110
I've read his report.

215
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,230
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

216
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,670
I was wondering whether it's not

217
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,190
a simple atrial septal defect.

218
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,990
Are you doubting about my diagnosis?

219
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,270
No.

220
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,310
I just think that...

221
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,190
When I was

222
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,630
in the Isaia Joint Medical team,

223
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,500
there was an Italian doctor

224
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,790
who shared a case with me.

225
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,390
So you are the resident who went

226
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,790
to Isaia with Zhang Yi Chi?

227
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,430
Yes, it's me.

228
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:31,950
That case...

229
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,910
I know.

230
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,670
Nowadays, it's been tough
for the Cardio Surgery.

231
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,420
The bypass surgery

232
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,990
is being replaced by PCI.

233
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,500
And the interventional surgery

234
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,310
for congenital heart
disease is evolving.

235
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,270
Cardio Surgery needs patients.

236
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,510
I can understand that.

237
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,950
But you don't have to be this nasty.

238
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,030
If Cardio Surgery needs anything,

239
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,910
just ask Zhang Yi Chi to come to me.

240
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,540
Atrial septal defect.

241
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,190
"The patient had visited the
local hospital for many times."

242
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,380
"His pulmonary hypertension
was considered"

243
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,780
"the result of atrial septal defect."

244
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,390
"At last, by combining it with a CT scan,"

245
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,590
"the clinician diagnosed him..."

246
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,540
Meng Zhen.

247
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,020
<i>We've found Xiao Jun.</i>

248
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,380
<i>We just reached the hospital.</i>

249
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,990
<i>And we're going to
the Cardiology Inpatient Ward.</i>

250
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,510
Okay, I'm coming over.

251
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,790
Teacher,

252
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,150
there had been a case.

253
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,140
The echocardiography showed it was
a simple atrial septal defect.

254
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,860
But after further tests with a CT scan...

255
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,710
Good, it's good for you
to take note of cases.

256
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,500
So Xiao Jun might be

257
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,510
the case too.

258
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,940
What case?

259
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,100
Who is Luo Xiao Jun?

260
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,700
He's a patient
of the Cardiology department.

261
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,700
Xia Chu, I've performed

262
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,990
three emergency surgeries.

263
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,630
It's been 16 hours!

264
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,950
The last patient went flatline

265
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,070
when I operated on him.

266
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,020
We, three doctors,

267
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,710
alternatively gave him CPR.

268
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,550
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

269
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,950
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

270
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,300
I just wanted to place
a tube in his femoral artery,

271
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,030
but his artery had completely shrunken!

272
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,790
I couldn't find it!

273
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,390
I couldn't find it.

274
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,310
-Dr Zhang.
-I tried my best!

275
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,470
I'm exhausted.

276
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,750
Don't tell me this.

277
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,870
I need to rest.

278
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,190
But isn't all this what

279
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,380
we should do?

280
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,310
Saving lives.

281
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,790
Isn't that what we should do?

282
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,300
I'm exhausted!

283
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,590
Rookie!

284
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,950
<i>But isn't all this</i>

285
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,190
<i>what we should do?</i>

286
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,150
<i>Saving lives.</i>

287
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,630
<i>Isn't that what we should do?</i>

288
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,120
<i>Hippocratic oath</i>

289
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,710
Dr Xia.

290
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,350
How is he?

291
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,780
It's been arranged.

292
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,190
The operation will be tomorrow.

293
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,430
Good.

294
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,150
Is anything wrong?

295
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,230
Xia Chu, tell us the truth.

296
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,630
What have I done?

297
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,950
We, as the patient's family,

298
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,910
need to know about
the kid's actual condition.

299
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,550
Dr Xia,

300
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,870
is something wrong with Xiao Jun?

301
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,260
No.

302
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,230
It's...

303
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,820
What do you mean by "no"?

304
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,150
Yes or no?

305
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,110
Why are you being so mean?

306
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,220
I'm only a resident.

307
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,390
What can I say?

308
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,140
Now you ask me what you can say?

309
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,300
Just say what you should say.

310
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,710
Just that

311
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,260
I'm not sure about it either.

312
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,750
Then hurry up and make it certain.

313
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,030
Okay?

314
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,390
You are a doctor.

315
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,110
You're unfit to be a doctor

316
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,390
if you can't let us

317
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,990
understand the kid's condition.

318
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,230
Liang Mu Ze, enough!

319
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,110
Who are you to criticise me?

320
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,750
As the most important
person to Xiao Jun,

321
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,220
besides making him feel unsafe,

322
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,260
worried that you'd leave at any time,

323
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,140
and making him think
he might never see you again,

324
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,350
what else did you do for him?

325
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,620
As his condition has worsened
to this point,

326
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,180
don't you have

327
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,390
a share of the blame?

328
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,790
You're unworthy of being a father

329
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,830
if you think I'm unfit to be a doctor!

330
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,190
Dr Xia, Xia...

331
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,550
Actually, Xiao Jun's condition

332
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,820
is more severe than you think.

333
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,190
What are you doing?

334
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,740
Dr Xia said

335
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,940
the atrial septal defect is not

336
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,710
the only problem that Xiao Jun has.

337
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,710
Do you trust her?

338
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,820
We need to understand

339
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,780
the kid's actual situation.

340
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,270
Right.

341
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,580
I think we should arrange

342
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,590
a CTA examination.

343
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,060
You're only

344
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,270
a Cardio Surgery resident.

345
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,070
You have no right
to interfere in my diagnosis.

346
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,980
I asked her to come here.

347
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,420
Dr Li,

348
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,510
can I talk to you for a second?

349
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,030
Just a second.

350
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,510
Let me take a look
at the patient's information.

351
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,750
The echocardiography shows clearly

352
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,350
that his pulmonary hypertension (PAH)
is caused by atrial septal defect (ASD).

353
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,500
Are you sure?

354
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,470
I'm sure.

355
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,059
But

356
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,230
the echocardiography

357
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,059
shows it's not a large notch.

358
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,140
It takes more than ten years for

359
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,990
ASD to progress to PAH.

360
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,540
Are you really sure?

361
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,620
Maybe there's an exception.

362
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,870
Uncertainty is not allowed.

363
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,950
You need to prove it to me

364
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,110
with the statistic
whether he is the exception or not.

365
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,190
How about this?

366
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,140
Cardiology Department requests
a Cardiac Surgery's consultation,

367
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,950
okay?

368
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,180
You decide it
as you're a higher-level doctor.

369
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,470
Okay.

370
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,670
Hello, I'm Zhang Yi Chi,

371
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,710
Associate Professor of Cardio Surgery.

372
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,220
We're planning to give the kid

373
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,430
a further inspection

374
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,230
to determine his condition.

375
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,310
Is it severe?

376
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,830
We'll know about it after the inspection.

377
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,830
Dr Li,

378
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,780
please hurry up and request

379
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,750
a CTA application form.

380
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,350
Okay.

381
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,300
Don't forget

382
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,830
to inform the radiology department.

383
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,310
It's an emergency.

384
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,150
Xia Chu,

385
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,630
you take the patient there

386
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,750
after we get the application form.

387
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,830
Yes.

388
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,110
Don't worry.

389
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,180
<i>Airport announcement.</i>

390
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,870
<i>Passenger on flight CA564</i>

391
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,110
<i>from Vitalik to Ningjiang,</i>

392
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,310
<i>Miss Mi Gu,</i>

393
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,460
<i>please proceed to Gate 4 immediately,</i>

394
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,830
<i>someone is waiting for you.</i>

395
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,630
Excuse me!

396
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,070
Sorry, I've got to catch a plane.

397
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,470
Thank you.

398
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,030
Miss Mi Gu.

399
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,870
Do you know me?

400
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,830
You've taken the wrong luggage.

401
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,430
That's yours.

402
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,260
I've waited for you for quite a while.

403
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,710
It's impossible.

404
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,950
I really took the wrong one.

405
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,590
Luckily, you figured it out,

406
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,550
or else it would have been awful
if we had left the airport.

407
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,990
I didn't open your luggage.

408
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,140
Let's exchange our information.

409
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,470
Just in case there's anything
in your luggage missing.

410
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,430
It won't happen for sure,

411
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,950
just in case.

412
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,550
What do you think?

413
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,420
It's not necessary.

414
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,990
Yes, it is. Hang on.

415
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,110
This is my name card.

416
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,190
Where is he?

417
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,500
So you start your company here.

418
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,270
This is an Innovation Park
which is just emerging.

419
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,630
So far,

420
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,710
no company has stationed in here.

421
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,070
It's quite discreet.

422
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,190
Most importantly,

423
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,390
it has the room structures that I need.

424
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,550
You're really wasting time.

425
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,990
You're not me.

426
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,630
You don't understand.

427
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,270
Just kidnap his daughter

428
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,220
and force him to hand in the goods,

429
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,780
just like we did before.

430
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,750
Make it quick.

431
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,980
How nice!

432
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,900
He is different from those merchants

433
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,990
whom we've dealt with.

434
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,510
It's not Isaia nor Vitalik here.

435
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,710
In China,

436
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,270
fighting and killing are
the dumbest methods to do things.

437
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,830
We need some greater intelligence
to complete the mission.

438
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,550
Is starting a company an advanced way?

439
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,470
Go ahead.

440
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,590
I'll show you around.

441
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,150
That's interesting.

442
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,910
After an eight-year gap,

443
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,070
we have to fill it in with something.

444
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,110
You do take after the  master.

445
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,030
After you.

446
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,590
It's nice.

447
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,590
Your cellar looks nice.

448
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,870
Help yourself.

449
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,510
I will.

450
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,350
The master asked me to help you.

451
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,230
He just couldn't trust me.

452
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,940
Why didn't you dispose of Sang Kun's body

453
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,910
discreetly?

454
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,110
How could you make such a big mistake

455
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,190
if you weren't trying to make trouble?

456
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,580
Is he angry?

457
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,910
What do you think?

458
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,390
<i>What do you think the dog
will turn into when it grows up?</i>

459
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,150
<i>Long Yi.</i>

460
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,550
<i>A big dog?</i>

461
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,190
<i>What do you think, Hu?</i>

462
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,830
<i>I keep it fed.</i>

463
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,180
<i>When he grows up,</i>

464
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,190
<i>you'll find out</i>

465
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,950
<i>that you've been raising a wolf.</i>

466
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,910
It's a video call from the master.

467
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,220
Master.

468
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,420
<i>Have you seen Long Yi?</i>

469
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,390
Yes, I have.

470
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,510
Master.

471
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,230
<i>He just came back from Isaia.</i>

472
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,150
He can help you

473
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,990
complete your mission in a better way.

474
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,790
I understand.

475
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,390
<i>Anything else?</i>

476
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,030
About Sang Kun's body,

477
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,420
I thought he had

478
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,510
a great force in Vitalik.

479
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,710
<i>To hide him from the public view,</i>

480
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,990
<i>I transported his body</i>

481
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,470
<i>to the borderline for disposing of it.</i>

482
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,470
<i>But then I ran into
China's military police.</i>

483
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,270
<i>I could only evacuate</i>

484
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,500
<i>to prevent further exposure.</i>

485
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,900
Apart from the body,

486
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,220
it's impossible

487
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,630
for them to get any critical clues.

488
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,470
Sang Kun has never been to China.

489
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,110
The body itself
is an useless information too.

490
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,750
So you can rest assured.

491
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,470
This minor blip

492
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,350
is not going to be an issue to T4

493
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,150
and it won't affect you.

494
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,510
<i>No need to explain.</i>

495
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,230
I believe in you.

496
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,110
I'll wait for your good news.

497
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,310
Do you think the master
really believes you?

498
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,510
He'll use me no matter
if he believes me or not.

499
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,990
Then what does

500
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,470
it matter?

501
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,140
You're the best actor.

502
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,350
Big Rat Baby,

503
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,990
welcome to my live room!

504
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,580
God Little Dear asks why it's so dark.

505
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,420
It might be a short circuit
due to the broken lightbulb.

506
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,780
What to do? Of course, I'll fix it myself.

507
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,550
You think I'll wait for a prince
to come to me?

508
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,870
Da Jin asks how I fix
the lightbulb in the dark.

509
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,510
Let me show you guys.

510
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,750
Let's go.

511
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,350
And God said, "Let there be light",

512
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,910
and there was light in the world.

513
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,270
Give me a second.

514
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,470
Now, we are using

515
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,070
the free light source from
the five-star hotel across the way.

516
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,100
I'll show you

517
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,070
the scenery across my house.

518
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,470
It's not bad, right?

519
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,390
I'll take a close-up of it.

520
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,230
We'll have a ten-minute break.

521
00:26:52,254 --> 00:27:02,254

522
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,830
Dr Zhang, how is it?

523
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,470
You are right.

524
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,300
The atrial septal defect

525
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,070
with left inferior
pulmonary artery abnormality,

526
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,670
origins from

527
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,790
the aorta descendens.

528
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,630
It's not clearly shown
on the echocardiography.

529
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,070
What is certain is that

530
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,310
some adjustments to the interventional
surgical plan are required.

531
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,700
It's more complicated than we predicted.

532
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,830
But fortunately,

533
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,870
we realised about it in advance.

534
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,030
We can make full preparation for it.

535
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,580
How about this?
I'll communicate with his family.

536
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,110
Go get some sleep.

537
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,470
Dr Zhang,

538
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,470
thanks for helping me.

539
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,670
To be honest,

540
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,630
I'm not helping you.

541
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,580
I'm helping a rookie,

542
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,780
named Zhang Yi Chi.

543
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,590
He was like you back then.

544
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,350
He thought that a doctor should

545
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,310
save lives.

546
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,870
A bounden duty.

547
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,270
So he

548
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,550
made rounds, was on duty,
completed the charts, operated every day.

549
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,430
He was tireless.

550
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,990
He really didn't feel tired.

551
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,340
To be frank,

552
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,710
I would have almost forgotten
what he was like

553
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,030
if it hadn't been
for what happened last night.

554
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,190
Thank you.

555
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,990
Dr Zhang...

556
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,660
But you need to keep this in mind.

557
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,780
Never have private contact

558
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,070
with the patient and his family.

559
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,220
Don't get me into some

560
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,430
strange trouble.

561
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,470
Or else,

562
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,150
don't ever think about
joining my surgeries.

563
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,670
I understand.

564
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,310
Goodbye.

565
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,420
Keep going! Dr Xia!

566
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,390
Dr Xia.

567
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,830
Meng Zhen.

568
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,830
Dr Xia, I'm here to say thank you.

569
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,270
Dr Zhang told me everything.

570
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,790
About Xiao Jun,

571
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,510
if you hadn't found out in advance,

572
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,830
we don't know how the consequences
could have been.

573
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,710
You're welcome, it's my job.

574
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,270
It's fine as long as Xiao Jun
can be rehabilitated.

575
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,470
Sorry for what happened last night.

576
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,470
Actually, Liang Mu Ze is a nice person.

577
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,260
But he's almost inhuman

578
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,900
if it's something about Xiao Jun.

579
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,710
So I apologise on his behalf.

580
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,980
Please don't mind him.

581
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,550
Actually I understand him.

582
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,030
The kid is sick,

583
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,630
as parents...

584
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,430
No.

585
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,950
I think you've got the wrong idea.

586
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,750
Mu Ze is not Xiao Jun's father.

587
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,190
He is a comrade of Xiao Jun's father.

588
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,030
Eight years ago,

589
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,150
<i>Xiao Jun's father sacrificed himself.</i>

590
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,950
<i>He was in my womb at that time.</i>

591
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,070
<i>He has spent most of the time with Mu Ze</i>

592
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,140
<i>since he was born.</i>

593
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,750
<i>And the other comrades</i>

594
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,830
<i>take good care of us as well.</i>

595
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,230
<i>That's why Xiao Jun has become
so dependent on Liang Mu Ze.</i>

596
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,630
Actually, I was not afraid
of being hospitalized.

597
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,580
Then why did you escape?

598
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,910
I was afraid you'd hate me.

599
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,710
You are a soldier, my name is Xiao Jun.

600
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,750
I should be brave

601
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,830
and strong

602
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,390
like you.

603
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,540
But I'm either getting bullied
by my classmates

604
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,790
or falling sick.

605
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,150
Over time,

606
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,390
you'll dislike me.

607
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,110
Xiao Jun,

608
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,830
let me tell you.

609
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,110
No matter what happens in the future,

610
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,270
whether you're outstanding,

611
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,870
or you're bad,

612
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,550
my love for you

613
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,510
won't change at all.

614
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,670
Then what about the doctor?

615
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,910
What's wrong with her?

616
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,070
Do you like her?

617
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,270
Why would I like her?

618
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,460
Are you crazy?

619
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,230
I saw you two quarrelling yesterday.

620
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,230
So what?

621
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,620
I like Xuan Xuan.

622
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,470
That's why I like to quarrel with her.

623
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,070
It's all part of the game.

624
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,230
You're good.

625
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,550
Don't tell Zhen.

626
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,750
Rest assured.

627
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,870
It's a men's secret.

628
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,030
You know?

629
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,150
You scared me.

630
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,030
Sister-in-law.

631
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,180
You're leaving?

632
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,150
I'm going back to the unit.

633
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,350
I already got you lunch.

634
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,310
Eat it before leaving.

635
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,150
No, you and Xiao Jun have it.

636
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,780
Okay.

637
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,750
And about

638
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,430
Xiao Jun's surgery,

639
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,590
you don't have to worry.

640
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,710
Dr Zhang is

641
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,670
an extremely skilled physician.

642
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,430
I know.

643
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,830
About the fee, you don't have to...

644
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,430
Don't worry, I got it.

645
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,180
My book store has gained
popularity in these two years.

646
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,140
It's running well.

647
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,230
And I've earned a lot of money
by selling

648
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,270
some cultural and creative products.

649
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,790
So I'm a hidden rich lady.

650
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,190
You don't have to worry.

651
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,020
Okay.

652
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,540
Anyway, as a mother,

653
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,460
I should endure

654
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,470
Xiao Jun's condition.

655
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,150
Rest assured.

656
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,670
You've done enough for us.

657
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,820
I'll get going, sister-in-law.

658
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:44,450
♫ Talking about romance,
I feel warmness in everything ♫

659
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:53,960
♫ Talking about warmness, I've become
soft-hearted although I'm stubborn ♫

660
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,610
<i>Emergency Department</i>

661
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:04,560
♫ My heart is filled
with your company daily ♫

662
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,950
Sorry.

663
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:14,330
♫ It's never a pity
to join what you're related to ♫

664
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,430
♫ Getting used to you
from breakfast to dinner ♫

665
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,310
♫ I've used up all my time
to keep you company ♫

666
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:29,419
♫ I like your likes,
the sensitivity of the details ♫

667
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,120
♫ Feeling safe with you around ♫

668
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:35,470
Captain Liang!

669
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:40,990
What's the matter?

670
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,030
I forgive you

671
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,750
about what happened last night.

672
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,109
What are you thinking about?

673
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,589
Xiao Jun's mother told me everything.

674
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,990
That mission

675
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,270
may have left you a painful memory.

676
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,470
And it might be the cause
of your insomnia.

677
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,669
Post-traumatic stress, you know?

678
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:00,350
You should consult a psychologist.

679
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:02,990
Although it's touching

680
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,590
that you take care

681
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,470
of Xiao Jun and his mother,

682
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,790
don't you think

683
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,460
that this

684
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,030
is another form of evading?

685
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,150
What am I evading?

686
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,710
Playing the role of Xiao Jun's father

687
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,860
to evade

688
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,390
the fact that your comrade
was sacrificed.

689
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,350
I know.

690
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,870
It's tough to face death.

691
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,870
But this is a mandatory subject

692
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,990
for an adult.

693
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,630
You're right.

694
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,110
When are you planning to move out?

695
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,870
What...

696
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,630
What's the connection between them?

697
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,150
Learning to live independently

698
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,750
is also a mandatory course for an adult.

699
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,550
Move out quickly, get out of my sight.

700
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,950
Is that incredible to own a house?

701
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,550
You don't want to see me
and I don't wish to live there either.

702
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,790
What a cheapskate!

703
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,190
Zhuo Ran?

704
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,380
It's me, Xia Chu.

705
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,470
Answer the phone! Answer the phone!

706
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,420
Xia Chu, be a good girl,
open the door for me.

707
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,990
-Xia Chu!
-What's wrong with her?

708
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,910
Has she been crying all night long?

709
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,670
-Move aside!
-Xia!

710
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,190
Girl!

711
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,790
What's wrong with you?

712
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,270
I was worried sick!

713
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,430
You're killing me!

714
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,580
What's wrong?

715
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,990
I'm back.

716
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,140
Xia Chu,

717
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,230
what should I do?

718
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,310
Do you think I'm getting old?

719
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,670
Why? Why did he ignore me?

720
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,830
Or

721
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,310
I'll just drop by the hotel tomorrow.

722
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,750
Don't tell me he left!

723
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,630
I don't even know his name,

724
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,270
his WeChat, his number.

725
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,710
I got nothing from him.

726
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,740
Do you know? That guy

727
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,190
is mysterious and depressed.

728
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,590
He makes me curious.

729
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,910
But I wish to protect him.
Anyway, he's amazing.

730
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,310
When I think

731
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,310
that the other ladies

732
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,150
may hunt him down

733
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,350
as he's out of my sight,

734
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,790
I feel like my heart
is scratched by a cat.

735
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,470
Do you think I will meet him again?

736
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,470
What if you meet him again?

737
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,470
Time passed,

738
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,750
so did the feelings.

739
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,110
Xia Chu,

740
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,700
didn't we agree

741
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,230
that you're here to keep me company?

742
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,950
Why are you being
more depressing than me?

743
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,030
What's wrong?

744
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,830
Zhuo Ran is back.

745
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,550
Zhuo Ran?

746
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,150
Is he that high-school deskmate of yours

747
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,630
that you mentioned to me?

748
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,380
I already forgot

749
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,470
what my high-school deskmates look like.

750
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,270
Has he come back for you?

751
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,710
I don't know.

752
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,950
Why didn't you ask him

753
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,390
why he disappeared back then?

754
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,070
I ran away.

755
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,390
Why?

756
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,030
You're not the one who did wrong.

757
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,510
Okay, stop thinking about him.

758
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,990
He is just a man, just forget about him.

759
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,950
Here.

760
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,110
Bottoms up.

761
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,430
It's been a long time, pretty ladies.

762
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,780
Here, have a drink.

763
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,390
Who wants to drink with you?

764
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,430
Don't you recognise me?

765
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,500
Are you crazy?

766
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,500
Mi Gu,

767
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,870
let's go.

768
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,150
You don't have to rush off.

769
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,150
Who are you?

770
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,550
It hurts!

771
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,150
We're drunk, it's a misunderstanding!

772
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,750
Just drink less if you're a bad drinker.

773
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,870
-I'm sorry!
-Gentlemen!

774
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,830
Gentlemen, don't fight!

775
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,470
These two guys are drunk

776
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,590
and are harassing my friends.

777
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,670
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

778
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,990
What are you waiting for?
Get them out!

779
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,190
I'm sorry. Please enjoy.

780
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,030
Xia Chu, are you all right?

781
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,340
He...

782
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,630
He is Zhuo Ran.

783
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,300
He is Zhuo Ran?

784
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,710
So that's what a player looks like.

785
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,590
He's handsome.

786
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,110
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

787
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,790
It's fine. Thank you.

788
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,550
Let's go.

789
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,510
You ran away again.

790
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,510
Right, I ran away again.

791
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,310
Just like you said,

792
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,870
I'm not the one who did wrong,

793
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,670
but I can't face him,

794
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,910
I can't talk to him,

795
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,340
I can't even question him.

796
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,380
His appearance

797
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,830
hasn't changed much from before,

798
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,180
but I feel

799
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,750
that something's wrong.

800
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,110
Is this my problem?

801
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,870
Are you asking me?

802
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,750
Mi Gu?

803
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,710
Where's my friend?

804
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,700
Only you who got on the car.

805
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:56,724
