00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,120
<i>Episode 3</i>

4
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,670
Meng Zhen.

5
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,190
Dr Xia.

6
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,430
I just finished rounding.

7
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,789
How is the result?

8
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,509
This is the echocardiography report.

9
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,789
The doctor said it's atrial septal defect

10
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,830
and made us handle the hospitalisation
procedure.

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,700
Where's Liang Mu Ze?

12
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,990
Mu Ze didn't come
as he has work to do today.

13
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,110
It's the same with the doctor here.

14
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,070
Why are they the same?

15
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,070
It's not what I meant.

16
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,229
Dr Xia, is something wrong?

17
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,060
One second.

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,030
Okay.

19
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,430
Okay, I'll be right there.

20
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,740
Dr Xia,

21
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,910
is something wrong
with Xiao Jun's condition?

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,180
How about this?

23
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,110
Let me keep this report.

24
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,590
You go and register
for admission first.

25
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,660
I'll see you at the ward

26
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,710
when I finish my work.

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,060
Okay.

28
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,230
I don't want to get admitted.

29
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,270
Xiao Jun.

30
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,870
Xiao Jun, be a good boy.

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,550
You can return home

32
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,870
after getting well.

33
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,030
I'm not sick.

34
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,190
Xiao Jun!

35
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,750
What are you doing?

36
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,180
It's all because of you

37
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,670
that Liang Mu Ze doesn't want us!

38
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,270
Luo Xiao Jun, watch your words!

39
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,510
You've become very rude!

40
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,630
Dr Xia, I'm sorry.

41
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,390
Something is wrong with him today.

42
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,870
Please don't mind him.

43
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,700
It's all right.

44
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,270
Hurry up and register for the admission.

45
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,470
Okay.

46
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,270
Let's go. What's wrong with you?

47
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,140
Enough.

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,230
Xiao Jun, let me tell you.

49
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,700
You can't be rude

50
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,900
to the elderly,

51
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,870
understand?

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,460
I don't want to be hospitalised.

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,590
Ask Liang Mu Ze to come to pick us up.

54
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,590
I want to see Liang Mu Ze.

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,180
You must behave.

56
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,710
Wait for me.

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,470
Hello, we're here
to register for admission.

58
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,260
Mr Zhang,

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,660
let me assist in your surgery.

60
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,150
I'm well-prepared.

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,030
Have you sent the patients'
medical reports?

62
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,190
I've finished sending them.

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,230
Dr Zhang,

64
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,990
Tian Yong's wound has recovered well.

65
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,310
I've changed the dressing for him.

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,500
Tell him to return and recuperate.

67
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,750
Regular inspection will do.

68
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,190
Dr Zhang,

69
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,390
are you close

70
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,070
with Dr Li Juan
from the cardiology department?

71
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,420
Just say it.

72
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,390
What's the matter?

73
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,700
She just admitted a patient,

74
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,579
named Luo Xiao Jun.

75
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,270
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,430
I suspect it's not a simple
atrial septal defect.

77
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,350
Some adjustments might need to be made

78
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,540
on the previous
interventional surgical plan.

79
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,590
This is his echocardiography report.

80
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,030
Did the cardiology department
request a cardio surgery consultation?

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,110
No.

82
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,860
In fact, Dr Li Juan

83
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,709
didn't perform further tests on him.

84
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,470
Then what do you want me to do?

85
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,790
Can you take a look at him?

86
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,430
He is a patient
the cardiology department admitted.

87
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,110
They didn't request our consultation.

88
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,150
We can't step in.

89
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,180
But...

90
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,430
This is the hospital policy.

91
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,670
Enough, I've got a surgery.

92
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,430
No, Dr Zhang.

93
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,430
Don't follow me.

94
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,180
I had a chance to convince him

95
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,750
to let me join the surgery.

96
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,460
Meng Zhen,

97
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,180
hang on, I'll be right there.

98
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,430
<i>No, Dr Xia.</i>

99
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,830
<i>Xiao Jun is missing.</i>

100
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,390
What?

101
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,030
This is Xiao Jun, right?

102
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,150
He left on his own?

103
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,350
It's fortunate

104
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,270
that he wasn't abducted.

105
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,540
This brat!

106
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,110
Where will he go?

107
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,550
Did he say anything

108
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,870
to you before leaving?

109
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,860
It's the same thing.

110
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,780
He said he didn't want to get admitted.

111
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,830
And that he wanted to see Liang Mu Ze.

112
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,550
Liang Mu Ze?

113
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,710
Yes.

114
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,430
Did you call him?

115
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,110
I did, but he didn't answer the phone.

116
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,670
I guess he's on a mission

117
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,990
or he might be training.

118
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,390
Don't worry.

119
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,380
How about this?

120
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,750
You search nearby the hospital.

121
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,590
I'll contact Liang Mu Ze.

122
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,150
Xiao Jun might go look for him.

123
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,470
Okay.

124
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,740
Lieutenant Tian!

125
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,620
Yes!

126
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,590
Hello, Dr Xia!

127
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,710
Great! You haven't left!

128
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,550
Is Liang Mu Ze on a mission?

129
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,110
I don't know.

130
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,150
Xiao Jun is missing.

131
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,700
He might go to the unit for him.

132
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,950
Hurry up and return to the unit!

133
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,780
If you see Liang Mu Ze,

134
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,030
you must tell him this news.

135
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,630
If you don't see him, you must be mindful.

136
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,060
If Xiao Jun really went to the unit,

137
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,190
bring him back immediately.

138
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,110
This child suffers from severe
congenital heart disease.

139
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,910
He needs to be hospitalised immediately.

140
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,660
His life would be in danger

141
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,110
if things went wrong, got it?

142
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,950
This time the operation

143
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,990
was not perfect.

144
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,670
We almost got trapped by the enemy.

145
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,910
This is fatal

146
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,390
for the special forces!

147
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,670
It's a disgrace!

148
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,820
There's always one way

149
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,230
to cleanse our shame!

150
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,550
Thunderbolt is invincible!

151
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,100
Kill them all!

152
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,110
I heard it from Xiao Wu

153
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,430
that you've taken two bottles
of sleeping pills

154
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,190
from the infirmary during this time.

155
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,550
Yes.

156
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,190
I lost

157
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,590
the previous bottle.

158
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,750
Did you lose it

159
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,790
or you finished it?

160
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,909
I lost it

161
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,630
or they hid it from me.

162
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,950
Your insomnia gets worse

163
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,990
every time you lose a comrade
or when there are

164
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,550
some flaws in the operation.

165
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,710
And then,

166
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,350
you train yourself like a maniac.

167
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,430
Because I'm angry.

168
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,070
Or are you scared?

169
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,310
I scare nothing.

170
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,790
It's been eight years, Mu Ze.

171
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,830
Don't force yourself too much.

172
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,590
I'm fine, Brigade Commander!

173
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,950
Good.

174
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,950
Salute!

175
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,060
Report to Brigade Commander!

176
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,030
Tian Yong has returned!

177
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,670
Get some rest.

178
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,740
Thank you, Brigade Commander.

179
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,710
Captain,

180
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,990
is Xiao Jun here?

181
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,110
No.

182
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,110
Why would Xiao Jun be here?

183
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,710
He is missing.

184
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,750
Missing?

185
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,390
Luo Xiao Jun?

186
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,590
Luo Xiao Jun?

187
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,990
Luo Xiao Jun?

188
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,630
He is not here!

189
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,310
I've searched
all the places where he could go.

190
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,870
This kid is really...

191
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,270
Where did he go?

192
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,070
He's here.

193
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,430
Xiao Jun.

194
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,230
What's wrong? Xiao Jun.

195
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,070
Xiao Jun, what's going on?

196
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,100
Don't scare me, Xiao Jun!

197
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,510
Xiao Jun!

198
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,670
I saw Dad.

199
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,750
Xiao Jun! Xiao Jun!

200
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,830
Xiao Jun!

201
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,190
-Xiao Jun! Wake up!
-Let's send him to the hospital.

202
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,510
Come in.

203
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,150
Dr Li,

204
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,910
I'm Xia Chu,
a resident of Cardio Surgery.

205
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,790
Can I help you?

206
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,510
You admitted a boy, named Luo Xiao Jun,

207
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,900
with a suspected atrial septal defect

208
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,710
in the morning.

209
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,910
Do you remember him?

210
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,630
I do.

211
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,190
What's the matter?

212
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,990
I would like

213
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,110
to ask your advice about this case.

214
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,910
I've read his report.

215
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,030
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

216
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,470
I was wondering whether it's not

217
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,990
a simple atrial septal defect.

218
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,790
Are you doubting about my diagnosis?

219
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,070
No.

220
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,110
I just think that...

221
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,990
When I was

222
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,430
in the Isaia Joint Medical team,

223
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,300
there was an Italian doctor

224
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,590
who shared a case with me.

225
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,190
So you are the resident who went

226
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,590
to Isaia with Zhang Yi Chi?

227
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,230
Yes, it's me.

228
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,750
That case...

229
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,710
I know.

230
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,470
Nowadays, it's been tough
for the Cardio Surgery.

231
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,220
The bypass surgery

232
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,790
is being replaced by PCI.

233
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,300
And the interventional surgery

234
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,110
for congenital heart
disease is evolving.

235
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,070
Cardio Surgery needs patients.

236
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,310
I can understand that.

237
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,750
But you don't have to be this nasty.

238
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,830
If Cardio Surgery needs anything,

239
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,710
just ask Zhang Yi Chi to come to me.

240
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,340
Atrial septal defect.

241
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,990
"The patient had visited the
local hospital for many times."

242
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,180
"His pulmonary hypertension
was considered"

243
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,580
"the result of atrial septal defect."

244
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,190
"At last, by combining it with a CT scan,"

245
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,390
"the clinician diagnosed him..."

246
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,340
Meng Zhen.

247
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,820
<i>We've found Xiao Jun.</i>

248
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,180
<i>We just reached the hospital.</i>

249
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,790
<i>And we're going to
the Cardiology Inpatient Ward.</i>

250
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,310
Okay, I'm coming over.

251
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,590
Teacher,

252
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,950
there had been a case.

253
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,940
The echocardiography showed it was
a simple atrial septal defect.

254
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,660
But after further tests with a CT scan...

255
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,510
Good, it's good for you
to take note of cases.

256
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,300
So Xiao Jun might be

257
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,310
the case too.

258
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,740
What case?

259
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,900
Who is Luo Xiao Jun?

260
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,500
He's a patient
of the Cardiology department.

261
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,500
Xia Chu, I've performed

262
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,790
three emergency surgeries.

263
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,430
It's been 16 hours!

264
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,750
The last patient went flatline

265
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,870
when I operated on him.

266
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,820
We, three doctors,

267
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,510
alternatively gave him CPR.

268
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,350
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

269
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,750
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

270
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,100
I just wanted to place
a tube in his femoral artery,

271
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,830
but his artery had completely shrunken!

272
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,590
I couldn't find it!

273
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,190
I couldn't find it.

274
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,110
-Dr Zhang.
-I tried my best!

275
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,270
I'm exhausted.

276
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,550
Don't tell me this.

277
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,670
I need to rest.

278
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,990
But isn't all this what

279
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,180
we should do?

280
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,110
Saving lives.

281
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,590
Isn't that what we should do?

282
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm exhausted!

283
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,390
Rookie!

284
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,750
<i>But isn't all this</i>

285
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,990
<i>what we should do?</i>

286
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,950
<i>Saving lives.</i>

287
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,430
<i>Isn't that what we should do?</i>

288
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,920
<i>Hippocratic oath</i>

289
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,510
Dr Xia.

290
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,150
How is he?

291
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,580
It's been arranged.

292
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,990
The operation will be tomorrow.

293
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,230
Good.

294
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,950
Is anything wrong?

295
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,030
Xia Chu, tell us the truth.

296
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,430
What have I done?

297
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,750
We, as the patient's family,

298
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,710
need to know about
the kid's actual condition.

299
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,350
Dr Xia,

300
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,670
is something wrong with Xiao Jun?

301
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,060
No.

302
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,030
It's...

303
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,620
What do you mean by "no"?

304
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,950
Yes or no?

305
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,910
Why are you being so mean?

306
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,020
I'm only a resident.

307
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,190
What can I say?

308
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,940
Now you ask me what you can say?

309
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,100
Just say what you should say.

310
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,510
Just that

311
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,060
I'm not sure about it either.

312
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,550
Then hurry up and make it certain.

313
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,830
Okay?

314
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,190
You are a doctor.

315
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,910
You're unfit to be a doctor

316
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,190
if you can't let us

317
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,790
understand the kid's condition.

318
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,030
Liang Mu Ze, enough!

319
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,910
Who are you to criticise me?

320
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,550
As the most important
person to Xiao Jun,

321
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,020
besides making him feel unsafe,

322
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,060
worried that you'd leave at any time,

323
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,940
and making him think
he might never see you again,

324
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,150
what else did you do for him?

325
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,420
As his condition has worsened
to this point,

326
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:43,980
don't you have

327
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,190
a share of the blame?

328
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,590
You're unworthy of being a father

329
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,630
if you think I'm unfit to be a doctor!

330
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,990
Dr Xia, Xia...

331
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,350
Actually, Xiao Jun's condition

332
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,620
is more severe than you think.

333
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,990
What are you doing?

334
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,540
Dr Xia said

335
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,740
the atrial septal defect is not

336
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,510
the only problem that Xiao Jun has.

337
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,510
Do you trust her?

338
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,620
We need to understand

339
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,580
the kid's actual situation.

340
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,070
Right.

341
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,380
I think we should arrange

342
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,390
a CTA examination.

343
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,860
You're only

344
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,070
a Cardio Surgery resident.

345
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,870
You have no right
to interfere in my diagnosis.

346
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,780
I asked her to come here.

347
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,220
Dr Li,

348
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,310
can I talk to you for a second?

349
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,830
Just a second.

350
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,310
Let me take a look
at the patient's information.

351
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,550
The echocardiography shows clearly

352
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,150
that his pulmonary hypertension (PAH)
is caused by atrial septal defect (ASD).

353
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,300
Are you sure?

354
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,270
I'm sure.

355
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,859
But

356
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,030
the echocardiography

357
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,859
shows it's not a large notch.

358
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:33,940
It takes more than ten years for

359
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,790
ASD to progress to PAH.

360
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,340
Are you really sure?

361
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,420
Maybe there's an exception.

362
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,670
Uncertainty is not allowed.

363
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,750
You need to prove it to me

364
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,910
with the statistic
whether he is the exception or not.

365
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,990
How about this?

366
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,940
Cardiology Department requests
a Cardiac Surgery's consultation,

367
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,750
okay?

368
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,980
You decide it
as you're a higher-level doctor.

369
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,270
Okay.

370
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,470
Hello, I'm Zhang Yi Chi,

371
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,510
Associate Professor of Cardio Surgery.

372
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,020
We're planning to give the kid

373
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,230
a further inspection

374
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,030
to determine his condition.

375
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,110
Is it severe?

376
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,630
We'll know about it after the inspection.

377
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,630
Dr Li,

378
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,580
please hurry up and request

379
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,550
a CTA application form.

380
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,150
Okay.

381
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,100
Don't forget

382
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,630
to inform the radiology department.

383
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,110
It's an emergency.

384
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,950
Xia Chu,

385
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,430
you take the patient there

386
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,550
after we get the application form.

387
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,630
Yes.

388
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,910
Don't worry.

389
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,980
<i>Airport announcement.</i>

390
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,670
<i>Passenger on flight CA564</i>

391
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,910
<i>from Vitalik to Ningjiang,</i>

392
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,110
<i>Miss Mi Gu,</i>

393
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,260
<i>please proceed to Gate 4 immediately,</i>

394
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,630
<i>someone is waiting for you.</i>

395
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,430
Excuse me!

396
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,870
Sorry, I've got to catch a plane.

397
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,270
Thank you.

398
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,830
Miss Mi Gu.

399
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,670
Do you know me?

400
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,630
You've taken the wrong luggage.

401
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,230
That's yours.

402
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,060
I've waited for you for quite a while.

403
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,510
It's impossible.

404
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,750
I really took the wrong one.

405
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,390
Luckily, you figured it out,

406
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,350
or else it would have been awful
if we had left the airport.

407
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,790
I didn't open your luggage.

408
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,940
Let's exchange our information.

409
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,270
Just in case there's anything
in your luggage missing.

410
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,230
It won't happen for sure,

411
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
just in case.

412
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,350
What do you think?

413
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,220
It's not necessary.

414
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,790
Yes, it is. Hang on.

415
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,910
This is my name card.

416
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,990
Where is he?

417
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,300
So you start your company here.

418
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,070
This is an Innovation Park
which is just emerging.

419
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,430
So far,

420
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,510
no company has stationed in here.

421
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,870
It's quite discreet.

422
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,990
Most importantly,

423
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,190
it has the room structures that I need.

424
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,350
You're really wasting time.

425
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,790
You're not me.

426
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,430
You don't understand.

427
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,070
Just kidnap his daughter

428
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,020
and force him to hand in the goods,

429
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,580
just like we did before.

430
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,550
Make it quick.

431
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,780
How nice!

432
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,700
He is different from those merchants

433
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,790
whom we've dealt with.

434
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,310
It's not Isaia nor Vitalik here.

435
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,510
In China,

436
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,070
fighting and killing are
the dumbest methods to do things.

437
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,630
We need some greater intelligence
to complete the mission.

438
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,350
Is starting a company an advanced way?

439
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,270
Go ahead.

440
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,390
I'll show you around.

441
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,950
That's interesting.

442
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,710
After an eight-year gap,

443
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,870
we have to fill it in with something.

444
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,910
You do take after the  master.

445
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,830
After you.

446
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,390
It's nice.

447
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,390
Your cellar looks nice.

448
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,670
Help yourself.

449
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,310
I will.

450
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,150
The master asked me to help you.

451
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,030
He just couldn't trust me.

452
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,740
Why didn't you dispose of Sang Kun's body

453
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,710
discreetly?

454
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,910
How could you make such a big mistake

455
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,990
if you weren't trying to make trouble?

456
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,380
Is he angry?

457
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,710
What do you think?

458
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,190
<i>What do you think the dog
will turn into when it grows up?</i>

459
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,950
<i>Long Yi.</i>

460
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,350
<i>A big dog?</i>

461
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,990
<i>What do you think, Hu?</i>

462
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,630
<i>I keep it fed.</i>

463
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,980
<i>When he grows up,</i>

464
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,990
<i>you'll find out</i>

465
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,750
<i>that you've been raising a wolf.</i>

466
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,710
It's a video call from the master.

467
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,020
Master.

468
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,220
<i>Have you seen Long Yi?</i>

469
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,190
Yes, I have.

470
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,310
Master.

471
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,030
<i>He just came back from Isaia.</i>

472
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,950
He can help you

473
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,790
complete your mission in a better way.

474
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,590
I understand.

475
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,190
<i>Anything else?</i>

476
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,830
About Sang Kun's body,

477
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,220
I thought he had

478
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,310
a great force in Vitalik.

479
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,510
<i>To hide him from the public view,</i>

480
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,790
<i>I transported his body</i>

481
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,270
<i>to the borderline for disposing of it.</i>

482
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,270
<i>But then I ran into
China's military police.</i>

483
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,070
<i>I could only evacuate</i>

484
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,300
<i>to prevent further exposure.</i>

485
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,700
Apart from the body,

486
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,020
it's impossible

487
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,430
for them to get any critical clues.

488
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,270
Sang Kun has never been to China.

489
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,910
The body itself
is an useless information too.

490
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,550
So you can rest assured.

491
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,270
This minor blip

492
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,150
is not going to be an issue to T4

493
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,950
and it won't affect you.

494
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,310
<i>No need to explain.</i>

495
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,030
I believe in you.

496
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,910
I'll wait for your good news.

497
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,110
Do you think the master
really believes you?

498
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,310
He'll use me no matter
if he believes me or not.

499
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,790
Then what does

500
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,270
it matter?

501
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,940
You're the best actor.

502
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,150
Big Rat Baby,

503
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,790
welcome to my live room!

504
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,380
God Little Dear asks why it's so dark.

505
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,220
It might be a short circuit
due to the broken lightbulb.

506
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,580
What to do? Of course, I'll fix it myself.

507
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,350
You think I'll wait for a prince
to come to me?

508
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,670
Da Jin asks how I fix
the lightbulb in the dark.

509
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,310
Let me show you guys.

510
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,550
Let's go.

511
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,150
And God said, "Let there be light",

512
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,710
and there was light in the world.

513
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,070
Give me a second.

514
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,270
Now, we are using

515
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,870
the free light source from
the five-star hotel across the way.

516
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,900
I'll show you

517
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,870
the scenery across my house.

518
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,270
It's not bad, right?

519
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,190
I'll take a close-up of it.

520
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,030
We'll have a ten-minute break.

521
00:26:52,054 --> 00:27:02,054

522
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,630
Dr Zhang, how is it?

523
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,270
You are right.

524
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,100
The atrial septal defect

525
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,870
with left inferior
pulmonary artery abnormality,

526
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,470
origins from

527
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,590
the aorta descendens.

528
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,430
It's not clearly shown
on the echocardiography.

529
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,870
What is certain is that

530
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,110
some adjustments to the interventional
surgical plan are required.

531
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,500
It's more complicated than we predicted.

532
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,630
But fortunately,

533
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,670
we realised about it in advance.

534
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,830
We can make full preparation for it.

535
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,380
How about this?
I'll communicate with his family.

536
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,910
Go get some sleep.

537
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,270
Dr Zhang,

538
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,270
thanks for helping me.

539
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,470
To be honest,

540
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,430
I'm not helping you.

541
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,380
I'm helping a rookie,

542
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,580
named Zhang Yi Chi.

543
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,390
He was like you back then.

544
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,150
He thought that a doctor should

545
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,110
save lives.

546
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,670
A bounden duty.

547
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,070
So he

548
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,350
made rounds, was on duty,
completed the charts, operated every day.

549
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,230
He was tireless.

550
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,790
He really didn't feel tired.

551
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,140
To be frank,

552
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,510
I would have almost forgotten
what he was like

553
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,830
if it hadn't been
for what happened last night.

554
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,990
Thank you.

555
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,790
Dr Zhang...

556
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,460
But you need to keep this in mind.

557
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,580
Never have private contact

558
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,870
with the patient and his family.

559
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,020
Don't get me into some

560
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,230
strange trouble.

561
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,270
Or else,

562
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,950
don't ever think about
joining my surgeries.

563
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,470
I understand.

564
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,110
Goodbye.

565
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,220
Keep going! Dr Xia!

566
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,190
Dr Xia.

567
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,630
Meng Zhen.

568
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,630
Dr Xia, I'm here to say thank you.

569
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,070
Dr Zhang told me everything.

570
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,590
About Xiao Jun,

571
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,310
if you hadn't found out in advance,

572
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,630
we don't know how the consequences
could have been.

573
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,510
You're welcome, it's my job.

574
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,070
It's fine as long as Xiao Jun
can be rehabilitated.

575
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,270
Sorry for what happened last night.

576
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,270
Actually, Liang Mu Ze is a nice person.

577
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,060
But he's almost inhuman

578
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,700
if it's something about Xiao Jun.

579
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,510
So I apologise on his behalf.

580
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,780
Please don't mind him.

581
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,350
Actually I understand him.

582
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,830
The kid is sick,

583
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,430
as parents...

584
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,230
No.

585
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,750
I think you've got the wrong idea.

586
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,550
Mu Ze is not Xiao Jun's father.

587
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,990
He is a comrade of Xiao Jun's father.

588
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,830
Eight years ago,

589
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,950
<i>Xiao Jun's father sacrificed himself.</i>

590
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,750
<i>He was in my womb at that time.</i>

591
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,870
<i>He has spent most of the time with Mu Ze</i>

592
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,940
<i>since he was born.</i>

593
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,550
<i>And the other comrades</i>

594
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,630
<i>take good care of us as well.</i>

595
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,030
<i>That's why Xiao Jun has become
so dependent on Liang Mu Ze.</i>

596
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,430
Actually, I was not afraid
of being hospitalized.

597
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,380
Then why did you escape?

598
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,710
I was afraid you'd hate me.

599
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,510
You are a soldier, my name is Xiao Jun.

600
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,550
I should be brave

601
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,630
and strong

602
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,190
like you.

603
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,340
But I'm either getting bullied
by my classmates

604
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,590
or falling sick.

605
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,950
Over time,

606
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,190
you'll dislike me.

607
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,910
Xiao Jun,

608
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,630
let me tell you.

609
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,910
No matter what happens in the future,

610
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,070
whether you're outstanding,

611
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,670
or you're bad,

612
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,350
my love for you

613
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,310
won't change at all.

614
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,470
Then what about the doctor?

615
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,710
What's wrong with her?

616
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,870
Do you like her?

617
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,070
Why would I like her?

618
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,260
Are you crazy?

619
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,030
I saw you two quarrelling yesterday.

620
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,030
So what?

621
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,420
I like Xuan Xuan.

622
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,270
That's why I like to quarrel with her.

623
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,870
It's all part of the game.

624
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,030
You're good.

625
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,350
Don't tell Zhen.

626
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,550
Rest assured.

627
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,670
It's a men's secret.

628
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,830
You know?

629
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,950
You scared me.

630
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,830
Sister-in-law.

631
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,980
You're leaving?

632
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,950
I'm going back to the unit.

633
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,150
I already got you lunch.

634
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,110
Eat it before leaving.

635
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,950
No, you and Xiao Jun have it.

636
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,580
Okay.

637
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,550
And about

638
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,230
Xiao Jun's surgery,

639
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,390
you don't have to worry.

640
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,510
Dr Zhang is

641
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,470
an extremely skilled physician.

642
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,230
I know.

643
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,630
About the fee, you don't have to...

644
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,230
Don't worry, I got it.

645
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,980
My book store has gained
popularity in these two years.

646
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,940
It's running well.

647
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,030
And I've earned a lot of money
by selling

648
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,070
some cultural and creative products.

649
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,590
So I'm a hidden rich lady.

650
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,990
You don't have to worry.

651
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,820
Okay.

652
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,340
Anyway, as a mother,

653
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,260
I should endure

654
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,270
Xiao Jun's condition.

655
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,950
Rest assured.

656
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,470
You've done enough for us.

657
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,620
I'll get going, sister-in-law.

658
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:44,250
♫ Talking about romance,
I feel warmness in everything ♫

659
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:53,760
♫ Talking about warmness, I've become
soft-hearted although I'm stubborn ♫

660
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,410
<i>Emergency Department</i>

661
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:04,360
♫ My heart is filled
with your company daily ♫

662
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,750
Sorry.

663
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:14,130
♫ It's never a pity
to join what you're related to ♫

664
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,230
♫ Getting used to you
from breakfast to dinner ♫

665
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:23,110
♫ I've used up all my time
to keep you company ♫

666
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:29,219
♫ I like your likes,
the sensitivity of the details ♫

667
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,920
♫ Feeling safe with you around ♫

668
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,270
Captain Liang!

669
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,790
What's the matter?

670
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,830
I forgive you

671
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,550
about what happened last night.

672
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,909
What are you thinking about?

673
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,389
Xiao Jun's mother told me everything.

674
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,790
That mission

675
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,070
may have left you a painful memory.

676
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,270
And it might be the cause
of your insomnia.

677
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,469
Post-traumatic stress, you know?

678
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:00,150
You should consult a psychologist.

679
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:02,790
Although it's touching

680
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,390
that you take care

681
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,270
of Xiao Jun and his mother,

682
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,590
don't you think

683
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,260
that this

684
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,830
is another form of evading?

685
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,950
What am I evading?

686
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,510
Playing the role of Xiao Jun's father

687
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,660
to evade

688
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,190
the fact that your comrade
was sacrificed.

689
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,150
I know.

690
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,670
It's tough to face death.

691
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,670
But this is a mandatory subject

692
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,790
for an adult.

693
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,430
You're right.

694
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,910
When are you planning to move out?

695
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,670
What...

696
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,430
What's the connection between them?

697
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,950
Learning to live independently

698
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,550
is also a mandatory course for an adult.

699
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,350
Move out quickly, get out of my sight.

700
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,750
Is that incredible to own a house?

701
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,350
You don't want to see me
and I don't wish to live there either.

702
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,590
What a cheapskate!

703
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,990
Zhuo Ran?

704
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,180
It's me, Xia Chu.

705
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,270
Answer the phone! Answer the phone!

706
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,220
Xia Chu, be a good girl,
open the door for me.

707
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,790
-Xia Chu!
-What's wrong with her?

708
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,710
Has she been crying all night long?

709
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,470
-Move aside!
-Xia!

710
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,990
Girl!

711
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,590
What's wrong with you?

712
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,070
I was worried sick!

713
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,230
You're killing me!

714
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,380
What's wrong?

715
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,790
I'm back.

716
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,940
Xia Chu,

717
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,030
what should I do?

718
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,110
Do you think I'm getting old?

719
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,470
Why? Why did he ignore me?

720
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,630
Or

721
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,110
I'll just drop by the hotel tomorrow.

722
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,550
Don't tell me he left!

723
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,430
I don't even know his name,

724
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,070
his WeChat, his number.

725
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,510
I got nothing from him.

726
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,540
Do you know? That guy

727
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,990
is mysterious and depressed.

728
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,390
He makes me curious.

729
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,710
But I wish to protect him.
Anyway, he's amazing.

730
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,110
When I think

731
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,110
that the other ladies

732
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,950
may hunt him down

733
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,150
as he's out of my sight,

734
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,590
I feel like my heart
is scratched by a cat.

735
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,270
Do you think I will meet him again?

736
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,270
What if you meet him again?

737
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,270
Time passed,

738
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,550
so did the feelings.

739
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,910
Xia Chu,

740
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,500
didn't we agree

741
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,030
that you're here to keep me company?

742
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,750
Why are you being
more depressing than me?

743
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,830
What's wrong?

744
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,630
Zhuo Ran is back.

745
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,350
Zhuo Ran?

746
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,950
Is he that high-school deskmate of yours

747
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,430
that you mentioned to me?

748
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,180
I already forgot

749
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,270
what my high-school deskmates look like.

750
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,070
Has he come back for you?

751
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,510
I don't know.

752
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,750
Why didn't you ask him

753
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,190
why he disappeared back then?

754
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,870
I ran away.

755
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,190
Why?

756
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,830
You're not the one who did wrong.

757
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,310
Okay, stop thinking about him.

758
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,790
He is just a man, just forget about him.

759
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,750
Here.

760
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,910
Bottoms up.

761
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,230
It's been a long time, pretty ladies.

762
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,580
Here, have a drink.

763
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,190
Who wants to drink with you?

764
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,230
Don't you recognise me?

765
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,300
Are you crazy?

766
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,300
Mi Gu,

767
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,670
let's go.

768
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,950
You don't have to rush off.

769
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,950
Who are you?

770
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,350
It hurts!

771
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,950
We're drunk, it's a misunderstanding!

772
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,550
Just drink less if you're a bad drinker.

773
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,670
-I'm sorry!
-Gentlemen!

774
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,630
Gentlemen, don't fight!

775
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,270
These two guys are drunk

776
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,390
and are harassing my friends.

777
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,470
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

778
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,790
What are you waiting for?
Get them out!

779
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,990
I'm sorry. Please enjoy.

780
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,830
Xia Chu, are you all right?

781
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,140
He...

782
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,430
He is Zhuo Ran.

783
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,100
He is Zhuo Ran?

784
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,510
So that's what a player looks like.

785
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,390
He's handsome.

786
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,910
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

787
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,590
It's fine. Thank you.

788
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,350
Let's go.

789
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,310
You ran away again.

790
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,310
Right, I ran away again.

791
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,110
Just like you said,

792
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,670
I'm not the one who did wrong,

793
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,470
but I can't face him,

794
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,710
I can't talk to him,

795
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,140
I can't even question him.

796
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,180
His appearance

797
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,630
hasn't changed much from before,

798
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,980
but I feel

799
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,550
that something's wrong.

800
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,910
Is this my problem?

801
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,670
Are you asking me?

802
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,550
Mi Gu?

803
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,510
Where's my friend?

804
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,500
Only you who got on the car.

805
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:56,524
