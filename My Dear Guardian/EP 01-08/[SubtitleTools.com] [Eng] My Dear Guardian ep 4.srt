<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,120
<i>Episode 4</i>

4
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,509
Why

5
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,750
did such a dramatic matter happen to me?

6
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,430
<i>I'm sorry, Mi Gu.</i>

7
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,350
<i>I've just found out
that I left you behind.</i>

8
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,230
<i>You had already left
when I went back for you.</i>

9
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,579
<i>Where are you now?</i>

10
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,630
<i>Did you return home?</i>

11
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,910
<i>Please don't be mad at me.</i>

12
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,070
<i>Too many troubles happened tonight,</i>

13
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,710
<i>my mind went blank.</i>

14
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,110
<i>Forgive me, Mi Gu.</i>

15
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,070
Silly girl, I've reached home.

16
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,510
Rest assured.

17
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,230
Get some rest too.

18
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,790
Everything

19
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,590
will be better tomorrow.

20
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,510
This is my name card.

21
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,310
Remember to call me if Xia Chu

22
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,710
goes to this kind of place again.

23
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,030
<i>Miss Mi Gu?</i>

24
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,030
<i>Do you know me?</i>

25
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,310
<i>You took the wrong luggage.</i>

26
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,030
<i>That's yours.</i>

27
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,070
<i>We've never met before.</i>

28
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,230
<i>Never.</i>

29
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,110
Halt!

30
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,270
Turn to the left!

31
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,780
Face forward!

32
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,190
The destination is TSC base.

33
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,870
Run and go!

34
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,470
One, two, one...

35
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,030
-Xiao Teng!
-Yes!

36
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,909
Lead the team!

37
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,390
Captain!

38
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,550
Welcome back!

39
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,030
How's the water temperature?

40
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,510
It's too cold.

41
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,950
That's why I lead the team back.

42
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,950
What's wrong?

43
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,150
Do you want to try?

44
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,910
Yes, I do.

45
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,700
Report!

46
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,870
Captain, the Brigade Headquarters want you

47
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,070
in the Brigade Commander's office
at eleven o'clock.

48
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,430
Okay, noted.

49
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,390
Yes!

50
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,390
Is Xiao Jun hospitalised?

51
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,030
Yes.

52
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,030
His operation is tomorrow, I wish

53
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,510
to take leave.

54
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,910
No.

55
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,070
Someone from the higher unit
is coming tomorrow.

56
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,750
Thunderbolt Commando

57
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,540
was picked to take
the comprehensive assessment.

58
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,670
As usual,

59
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,870
every participant's result

60
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,060
will be recorded.

61
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,909
The team will fail

62
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,390
if any one of you gives up.

63
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,990
So

64
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,350
think thoroughly

65
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,950
whether to put Tian Yong on.

66
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,350
I don't have to think.

67
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,470
Just let him decide.

68
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,590
It's a matter of the honour
of the Special Forces Brigade

69
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,470
and your future.

70
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,070
Liang Mu Ze,

71
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,390
don't let me down.

72
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,710
Yes!

73
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,260
Luo Xiao Jun's condition is complicated.

74
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,750
A simple interventional surgery
can only cure ASD,

75
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,420
but it's useless
to the left inferior pulmonary artery.

76
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,790
It's the same to thoracotomy,
the wound is large

77
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,710
and it damages the patient's
cardiopulmonary function.

78
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,150
So I think

79
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,550
the most secure way is

80
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,030
to have a hybrid operation by combining
medical and surgical treatment.

81
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,310
You, cardiologists perform
the blocking of ASD.

82
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,070
We, cardiac surgeons operate
on the pulmonary artery.

83
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,950
The operation duration
can be shortened in this way.

84
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,590
And extracorporeal circulation
is not needed either.

85
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,750
The post-operative survival rate
will be improved.

86
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,190
If the interventional surgery fails,

87
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,180
we can still perform

88
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,500
surgical repair of ASD.

89
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,910
In this way,

90
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,270
we can avoid a second surgery situation.

91
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,110
This will put forward higher requirements

92
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,870
for our performance.

93
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,230
I hope that everyone

94
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,710
can work together.

95
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,150
Okay, you're dismissed.

96
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,180
This case

97
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,470
can be written in the SCI case.

98
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,510
Guess whom Zhang will take
to enter the operating room.

99
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,990
May I have your attention?

100
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,470
Xiao Xiao.

101
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,740
Yes.

102
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,790
From now on,

103
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,070
you're in charge of Luo Xiao Jun.

104
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,230
Tomorrow,

105
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,350
you're going into the operating room.

106
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,060
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

107
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,110
I'll work hard

108
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,350
and get the job done.

109
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,710
Hand over the information to her.

110
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,990
If anyone wishes to observe my surgery,

111
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,510
I hope that you guys

112
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,030
can impress me with your performance.

113
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,710
Teacher,

114
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,980
I'd like to talk to you.

115
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,230
What's the matter?

116
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,070
I was the one discovering
Luo Xiao Jun's condition

117
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,270
and

118
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,990
I'm in charge of communicating
with his mother.

119
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,870
So what?

120
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,270
That's why you thought

121
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,270
you could daze and desert at will

122
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,390
during today's preoperative

123
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,510
discussion meeting?

124
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,390
You can do whatever you want

125
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,030
because he is your loot, right?

126
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,230
No.

127
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,990
Let me tell you this.

128
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,860
There are only two results
of saving lives.

129
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,100
Either

130
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,270
a promise success,

131
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,430
or zero failure.

132
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,510
There's no other choice.

133
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,590
Do you know how complicated

134
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,310
Luo Xiao Jun's surgery is?

135
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,630
Do you know how risky his surgery is,

136
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,310
how high the risk is?

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,830
If you have never
thought about what I said,

138
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,910
I'll never allow

139
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,510
an unprepared resident

140
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,310
to enter my operating room.

141
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,310
I'm sorry, Teacher.

142
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,790
I'm extremely disappointed

143
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,790
with what you did today.

144
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,610
<i>Miss Lan</i>

145
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,780
<i>Miss Lan</i>

146
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,510
<i>Miss Lan.</i>

147
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,430
Girl,

148
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,790
why didn't you answer my video call?

149
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,150
Are you working overtime?

150
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,950
No, no overtime today.

151
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,270
My internet is down.

152
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,070
I don't want to waste my internet data.

153
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,430
Have you eaten?

154
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,540
<i>Yes.</i>

155
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,030
What did you eat?

156
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,550
I ate

157
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,140
my homemade sweet and sour ribs.

158
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,750
<i>I cooked vegetables too.</i>

159
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,030
And a bowl of millet congee
with half a steamed bun.

160
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,670
Not bad.

161
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,430
You have made yourself a hearty meal.

162
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,910
<i>Of course.</i>

163
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,150
A healthy body leads to a healthy life.

164
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,780
That goes without saying.

165
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,630
<i>Right.</i>

166
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,350
You need to take care of yourself.

167
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,310
You're out there.

168
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,310
<i>I don't request anything,</i>

169
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,580
but you need to eat well

170
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,390
and take good care of yourself,
do you hear me?

171
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,670
<i>Girl,</i>

172
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,430
<i>how is</i>

173
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,380
Liang Mu Ze's house?

174
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,750
Do you still want to move out?

175
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,350
I do.

176
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,220
<i>When are you going to move out?</i>

177
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,070
<i>How's your house-hunting?</i>

178
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,550
I can come over to help you

179
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,870
if you're not free.

180
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,910
<i>Never mind.</i>

181
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,950
<i>The house...</i>

182
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,070
I've already found one.

183
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,990
It's very near to our hospital

184
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,430
<i>and the environment is good.</i>

185
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,310
<i>I like the renovation as well.</i>

186
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,420
<i>The point is</i>

187
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,700
<i>the landlord is not in the country.</i>

188
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,350
He is unfamiliar with the domestic market.

189
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,430
The fee is over

190
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,790
one-third below the market rates.

191
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,390
It's cost-effective.

192
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,790
I see.

193
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,030
That's great.

194
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,270
Then I'll tell Mu Min.

195
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,870
No, don't...

196
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,820
Mum.

197
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,230
<i>Son, what are you doing?</i>

198
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm going to sleep.

199
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,550
Sleep?

200
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,980
Are you sleeping alone

201
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,430
or sleeping with someone?

202
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,390
Mum, I'm in the unit.

203
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,190
I know that.

204
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,900
How is it?
What progress are you two making?

205
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,990
It's good.

206
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,030
How good is it?

207
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,030
How good is it?

208
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,150
When we're at home,

209
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,660
she cooks,

210
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,830
I wash the dishes.

211
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,510
<i>And then,</i>

212
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,390
<i>we go for a ride.</i>

213
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,310
<i>Both of us</i>

214
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,630
<i>know each other's job.</i>

215
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,870
<i>What a relief!</i>

216
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,110
We talk every chance we have.

217
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,150
<i>Move out</i>

218
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,670
<i>from my house in one week.</i>

219
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,100
It's very good.

220
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,070
Really, very good.

221
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,270
<i>Is it?</i>

222
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,590
Yes, we're good.

223
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,110
<i>Then why did her mother tell me</i>

224
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,630
that she found a rental

225
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,710
and that she's ready
to move out to live alone?

226
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,580
<i>Really?</i>

227
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,710
What do you mean?

228
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,190
Stop playing dumb!

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,190
She didn't tell me that.

230
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,230
What's going on?

231
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,830
<i>Did you tell her</i>

232
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,910
<i>that you have a son?</i>

233
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,430
Did you?

234
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,230
Liang Mu Ze,

235
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,910
I think you're crazy.

236
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,150
I'm not... I...

237
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,060
I... My reception... I...

238
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,510
<i>Hello, Mum,
I've got bad reception here. Hello?</i>

239
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,030
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you this.

240
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,670
If you dare to kick her out,

241
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,630
I'll find you a new tenant right away.

242
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,830
Too much noise, I can't hear you.

243
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,350
I can't hear you.

244
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,030
<i>You wait and see!</i>

245
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,590
The reception is bad.

246
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm sure

247
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,820
I can still deal with you.

248
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,190
I can't hear you.

249
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,390
Mum...

250
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,150
<i>Liang Mu Ze!</i>

251
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,070
Mum...

252
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,030
This brat!

253
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,990
<i>Old lady</i>

254
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,830
You had trouble sleeping too?

255
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,750
What do you mean?

256
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,910
You can't sleep,

257
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,030
but I'm just waiting to sleep.

258
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,350
How's your preparation
for the assessment?

259
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,550
I'm a bit cringed but
I don't want to give up.

260
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,790
Then just go on.

261
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,270
But I'm afraid that
I'll affect the result of the team.

262
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,350
"Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share".

263
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,630
Is this how they said?

264
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,550
The recruits line up,
the Special Forces Brigade

265
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,510
Hunter Military School, Isaia,

266
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,270
we are brothers.

267
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,540
I leave my life to you,
the result means nothing.

268
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,310
What's after that?

269
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,340
What do you mean?

270
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,510
How does the poem continue?

271
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,990
Captain Liang,
I wish you could hear yourself.

272
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,710
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

273
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,910
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our armour suit and spear shine.

274
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,910
We move forward, your hand in mine.

275
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,470
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

276
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,150
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our armour suit and spear shine.

277
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,820
We move forward, your hand in mine.

278
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,900
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?

279
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,470
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

280
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,950
Our Sire sends the troops,

281
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,420
let’s make our armour suit
and spear shine.

282
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,950
We move forward, your hand in mine.

283
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,910
The age of death of the deceased is

284
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,790
in the range between 40 to 45 years old.

285
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,340
The cause of death

286
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,550
is haemorrhagic shock

287
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,110
due to the gunshot wound on the chest.

288
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,630
From the deceased's skin wound

289
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,870
and the residue,

290
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,350
the deceased was

291
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,430
bitten by a large dog after he died.

292
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,470
But this is not the most crucial point.

293
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,580
The most crucial point is that

294
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,540
from the pathological anatomy,

295
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,630
I found

296
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,830
the deceased had suffered

297
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,950
from a very severe kidney disease.

298
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,750
He even needed a kidney transplant.

299
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,980
Transplant?

300
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,950
Yes.

301
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,910
Moreover,

302
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,670
the deceased and the data

303
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,910
sent by the Interpol

304
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,590
of the seriously wounded person

305
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,030
who was almost kidnapped

306
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,790
in Isaia Joint Medical outpost,

307
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,070
are highly matched,

308
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,790
no matter if it's their
ABO RBC blood group

309
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,910
or MHC antigen.

310
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,700
<i>Rao Zhi,</i>

311
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,590
there's been a murder
in Jiaotong University's district.

312
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,790
Okay, noted.

313
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,070
I'm going to the scene.

314
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,780
We'll talk about it later.

315
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,750
Okay.

316
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,150
Let's go.

317
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,990
Take a look in there. Yes.

318
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,660
Rao Zhi,

319
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,230
how is it?

320
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,140
It's in there.

321
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,350

322
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,980

it might be difficult.

326
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,670
Okay, noted.

327
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,550
Go a little further.

328
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,910

00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,870
<i>I think we should repair the ASD.</i>

376
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,310
<i>No.</i>

377
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,230
<i>The heart rate and blood pressure
of the patient are unstable.</i>

378
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,270
<i>He can't undergo cardiac surgery.</i>

379
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,870
Why did it fail?

380
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,230
How could it fail?

381
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,750
There shouldn't have been no problem
about the surgical plan.

382
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,590
What's the problem?

383
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,230
I don't know.

384
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,710
It would be great if I knew it.

385
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,990
Xia Chu,

386
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,190
do you know that?

387
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,510
The responsibility of a doctor

388
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,420
is to relieve often,

389
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,070
to comfort always,

390
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,670
to cure sometimes.

391
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,190
It means that

392
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,470
medicine

393
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,260
has boundaries that we can't reach.

394
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,340
Doctor is not God.

395
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,470
I've tried my best.

396
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,630
Really.

397
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,270
Perhaps the God of Fortune

398
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,190
is not on our side this time.

399
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,230
Then...

400
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,870
Then what should we do next?

401
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,390
When he has recovered,

402
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,230
we'll repair the atrial septal defect

403
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,870
and the surgery of the pulmonary artery.

404
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,380
But

405
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,230
his cardiopulmonary function
was seriously damaged.

406
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,870
Can he really withstand the trauma?

407
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,470
I hope so.

408
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,510
How's your wound?

409
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,190
It's fully recovered.

410
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,750
Then why did you act like
you were dying during the assessment?

411
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,870
Why would your strength
be reinforced otherwise?

412
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,550
Xiao Jun's condition is not good.

413
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,950
Have you asked the doctor?

414
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,670
No.

415
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,390
What about giving a call?

416
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,950
I'm scared.

417
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,870
13944822375

418
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,670
It's Dr Xia's number.

419
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,710
I have Zhang Yi Chi's number,
why would I ask her?

420
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,660
Dr Xia is prettier.

421
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,910
You're shallow.

422
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,350
I can get over it.

423
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,230
You can do it too,

424
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,110
sooner or later.

425
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,340
<i>Mu Ze.</i>

426
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,950
What would you do

427
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,470
if you knew Xiao Jun's operation

428
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,230
didn't work?

429
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,310
Call the doctor

430
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,470
to ask about the reason why it didn't work

431
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,270
and the next arrangement of the operation

432
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,750
to start an early preparation.

433
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,470
Right, it should be like this.

434
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,510
And you'll comfort
Xiao Jun and your sister-in-law.

435
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,110
You'll tell them

436
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,110
that you'll protect them,

437
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,220
even if the sky falls.

438
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,950
You've always been like this, right?

439
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,630
What are you holding back for?

440
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,590
I'm not sure.

441
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,430
I'll be scared

442
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,510
if it's a very bad result.

443
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,510
Will you?

444
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,070
I will.

445
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,070
Then what should I do?

446
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,910
I dare to stand in front of you

447
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,670
because I know

448
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,110
you're right behind me.

449
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,110
You too.

450
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,470
Go find your comrade

451
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,900
and fight with them.

452
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,630
<i>It's me.</i>

453
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,310
I'm looking for the house.

454
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,910
<i>It's not about the house.</i>

455
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,510
It's about Xiao Jun.

456
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,950
So you know.

457
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,270
The reason of the failure

458
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,190
is not known yet.

459
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,030
I have no idea

460
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,790
why it became like this.

461
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,350
Perhaps that's what
clinical practice is like.

462
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,989
<i>Even if</i>

463
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,550
<i>we're well-prepared,</i>

464
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,909
<i>there might still</i>

465
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,590
<i>be a probability to fail.</i>

466
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,429
<i>We are making the second surgical plan.</i>

467
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,550
<i>It needs some time.</i>

468
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,310
No matter if you believe it or not,

469
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,909
I still want to say

470
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,750
actually,

471
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,350
we, the doctors, are the ones who wish

472
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,389
more than anyone else
that the patient could be safe

473
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,670
every time we send them
to the operating room.

474
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,190
We...

475
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,500
I'm sorry.

476
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,590
Anything else?

477
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,790
If you have nothing to ask, I'll...

478
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,030
<i>800-meter road with obstacles.</i>

479
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,590
When I reached two-thirds of it,

480
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,670
I thought I couldn't do it.

481
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,540
8000-meter mazy run.

482
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,670
When I reached the final mile,

483
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,870
Tian Yong was hurt.

484
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,950
I carried him.

485
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,830
I knew he was hurt.

486
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,870
And he knew I was exhausted.

487
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,830
<i>But the reason I carried him
and ran to the finish line</i>

488
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,710
was only because he wished

489
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,670
to be on the field.

490
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,710
What are you trying to say,
Liang Mu Ze?

491
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,910
Xiao Jun is only eight years old.

492
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,830
I know the hospital is not my battlefield.

493
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,950
Now I also know that

494
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,030
<i>doctors</i>

495
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,270
<i>are irreplaceable.</i>

496
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,710
So I ask you

497
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,590
not to give up

498
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,190
on Xiao Jun

499
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,630
no matter what,

500
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,110
<i>okay?</i>

501
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,230
I got it.

502
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,190
I'll pass your message to Dr Zhang.

503
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,430
Thank you.

504
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,230
Dr Zhang.

505
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,910
I just finished an operation
and came here to see Xiao Jun.

506
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,790
You've worked hard.

507
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,030
What did you buy?

508
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,030
A customer ordered a bracelet from me.

509
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,590
She was eager to get it so I went out

510
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,270
to buy some accessories.

511
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,910
I heard it from Mu Ze

512
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,670
that you've opened a book store.

513
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,310
Opening a book store is my hobby.

514
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,190
I sell some clothes

515
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,780
designed by me
and some freelance designers

516
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,830
in the store.

517
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,190
And I sell some
cultural and creative products too.

518
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,470
Dreaming is important,

519
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,150
but it's important to earn a living too.

520
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,110
Don't you think, Dr Zhang?

521
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,150
Dr Zhang,

522
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,870
does Xiao Jun still have a chance?

523
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,030
Will you be willing to try

524
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,590
if we arrange a cardiac surgery

525
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,870
for Xiao Jun?

526
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,830
For his current situation,

527
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,110
it might be hard

528
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,870
to proceed with an interventional surgery.

529
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,430
I think

530
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,150
we're more confident

531
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,350
on performing a surgery.

532
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,510
I follow your decision.

533
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,830
I feel bad for him

534
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,910
as he has to suffer a lot

535
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,510
at this young age,

536
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,750
but you are a doctor.

537
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,220
I believe in your choice

538
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,750
as long as Xiao Jun can be cured.

539
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,870
I trust you, Dr Zhang.

540
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,190
I understand.

541
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,950
Who is it?

542
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,990
It's early.

543
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,030
Coming!

544
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,910
Why have you come here?

545
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,270
I want to sleep on my half Tatami.

546
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,270
Have you had breakfast?

547
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,470
Yes.

548
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,070
Don't mind me, carry on.

549
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,870
There are food and beverages
in the fridge, help yourself.

550
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,550
Okay.

551
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,150
Didn't you tell me that

552
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,110
you're really busy
preparing for the surgery?

553
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,110
The surgery didn't work.

554
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,230
Why?

555
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,470
I don't know.

556
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,110
Perhaps it's often the case.

557
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,630
The patient whom the doctors

558
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,750
pay a lot of attention to

559
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,670
might not have a positive outcome.

560
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,710
I increasingly find that

561
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,790
what we can do is very limited.

562
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,110
I think

563
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,550
something's wrong
with the Feng Shui of your house.

564
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,350
Did you get someone
to read the geomancy?

565
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,270
Why don't

566
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,750
you move out?

567
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,830
I wish too.

568
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,110
But the other houses are more terrifying.

569
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,230
Come to our district.

570
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,990
There's a unit in our district,

571
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,150
it has the same layout as mine.

572
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,100
It's right above us.

573
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,870
Does it have
a floor-to-ceiling window too?

574
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,310
It does.

575
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,030
That...

576
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,020
He gave me this at that day

577
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,900
after you left.

578
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,350
To get your news.

579
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,740
I was thinking

580
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,270
to throw it away,

581
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,230
but then I thought

582
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,830
he might not mean any harm.

583
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,230
It's been years after all.

584
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,780
I'll just throw it away.

585
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:35,804
