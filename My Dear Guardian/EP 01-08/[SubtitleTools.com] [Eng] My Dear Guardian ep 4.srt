<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>Episode 4</i>

4
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,709
Why

5
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,950
did such a dramatic matter happen to me?

6
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,630
<i>I'm sorry, Mi Gu.</i>

7
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,550
<i>I've just found out
that I left you behind.</i>

8
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,430
<i>You had already left
when I went back for you.</i>

9
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,779
<i>Where are you now?</i>

10
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,830
<i>Did you return home?</i>

11
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,110
<i>Please don't be mad at me.</i>

12
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,270
<i>Too many troubles happened tonight,</i>

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,910
<i>my mind went blank.</i>

14
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,310
<i>Forgive me, Mi Gu.</i>

15
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,270
Silly girl, I've reached home.

16
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,710
Rest assured.

17
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,430
Get some rest too.

18
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:56,990
Everything

19
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,790
will be better tomorrow.

20
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,710
This is my name card.

21
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,510
Remember to call me if Xia Chu

22
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,910
goes to this kind of place again.

23
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,230
<i>Miss Mi Gu?</i>

24
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,230
<i>Do you know me?</i>

25
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,510
<i>You took the wrong luggage.</i>

26
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,230
<i>That's yours.</i>

27
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,270
<i>We've never met before.</i>

28
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,430
<i>Never.</i>

29
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,310
Halt!

30
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,470
Turn to the left!

31
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,980
Face forward!

32
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,390
The destination is TSC base.

33
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,070
Run and go!

34
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,670
One, two, one...

35
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,230
-Xiao Teng!
-Yes!

36
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,109
Lead the team!

37
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,590
Captain!

38
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,750
Welcome back!

39
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,230
How's the water temperature?

40
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,710
It's too cold.

41
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,150
That's why I lead the team back.

42
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,150
What's wrong?

43
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,350
Do you want to try?

44
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,110
Yes, I do.

45
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,900
Report!

46
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,070
Captain, the Brigade Headquarters want you

47
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,270
in the Brigade Commander's office
at eleven o'clock.

48
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,630
Okay, noted.

49
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,590
Yes!

50
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,590
Is Xiao Jun hospitalised?

51
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,230
Yes.

52
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,230
His operation is tomorrow, I wish

53
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,710
to take leave.

54
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,110
No.

55
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,270
Someone from the higher unit
is coming tomorrow.

56
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,950
Thunderbolt Commando

57
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,740
was picked to take
the comprehensive assessment.

58
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,870
As usual,

59
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,070
every participant's result

60
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,260
will be recorded.

61
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,109
The team will fail

62
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,590
if any one of you gives up.

63
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,190
So

64
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,550
think thoroughly

65
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,150
whether to put Tian Yong on.

66
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,550
I don't have to think.

67
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,670
Just let him decide.

68
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,790
It's a matter of the honour
of the Special Forces Brigade

69
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,670
and your future.

70
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,270
Liang Mu Ze,

71
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,590
don't let me down.

72
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,910
Yes!

73
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,460
Luo Xiao Jun's condition is complicated.

74
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,950
A simple interventional surgery
can only cure ASD,

75
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,620
but it's useless
to the left inferior pulmonary artery.

76
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,990
It's the same to thoracotomy,
the wound is large

77
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,910
and it damages the patient's
cardiopulmonary function.

78
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,350
So I think

79
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,750
the most secure way is

80
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,230
to have a hybrid operation by combining
medical and surgical treatment.

81
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,510
You, cardiologists perform
the blocking of ASD.

82
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,270
We, cardiac surgeons operate
on the pulmonary artery.

83
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,150
The operation duration
can be shortened in this way.

84
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,790
And extracorporeal circulation
is not needed either.

85
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,950
The post-operative survival rate
will be improved.

86
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,390
If the interventional surgery fails,

87
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,380
we can still perform

88
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,700
surgical repair of ASD.

89
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,110
In this way,

90
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,470
we can avoid a second surgery situation.

91
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,310
This will put forward higher requirements

92
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,070
for our performance.

93
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,430
I hope that everyone

94
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,910
can work together.

95
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,350
Okay, you're dismissed.

96
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,380
This case

97
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,670
can be written in the SCI case.

98
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,710
Guess whom Zhang will take
to enter the operating room.

99
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,190
May I have your attention?

100
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,670
Xiao Xiao.

101
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:41,940
Yes.

102
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,990
From now on,

103
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,270
you're in charge of Luo Xiao Jun.

104
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,430
Tomorrow,

105
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,550
you're going into the operating room.

106
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,260
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

107
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,310
I'll work hard

108
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,550
and get the job done.

109
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,910
Hand over the information to her.

110
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,190
If anyone wishes to observe my surgery,

111
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
I hope that you guys

112
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,230
can impress me with your performance.

113
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,910
Teacher,

114
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,180
I'd like to talk to you.

115
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,430
What's the matter?

116
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,270
I was the one discovering
Luo Xiao Jun's condition

117
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,470
and

118
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,190
I'm in charge of communicating
with his mother.

119
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,070
So what?

120
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,470
That's why you thought

121
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,470
you could daze and desert at will

122
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,590
during today's preoperative

123
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,710
discussion meeting?

124
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,590
You can do whatever you want

125
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,230
because he is your loot, right?

126
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,430
No.

127
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,190
Let me tell you this.

128
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,060
There are only two results
of saving lives.

129
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,300
Either

130
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,470
a promise success,

131
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,630
or zero failure.

132
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,710
There's no other choice.

133
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,790
Do you know how complicated

134
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,510
Luo Xiao Jun's surgery is?

135
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,830
Do you know how risky his surgery is,

136
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,510
how high the risk is?

137
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,030
If you have never
thought about what I said,

138
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,110
I'll never allow

139
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,710
an unprepared resident

140
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,510
to enter my operating room.

141
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,510
I'm sorry, Teacher.

142
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,990
I'm extremely disappointed

143
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,990
with what you did today.

144
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,810
<i>Miss Lan</i>

145
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,980
<i>Miss Lan</i>

146
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,710
<i>Miss Lan.</i>

147
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,630
Girl,

148
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,990
why didn't you answer my video call?

149
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,350
Are you working overtime?

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,150
No, no overtime today.

151
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,470
My internet is down.

152
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,270
I don't want to waste my internet data.

153
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,630
Have you eaten?

154
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,740
<i>Yes.</i>

155
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,230
What did you eat?

156
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,750
I ate

157
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,340
my homemade sweet and sour ribs.

158
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,950
<i>I cooked vegetables too.</i>

159
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,230
And a bowl of millet congee
with half a steamed bun.

160
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,870
Not bad.

161
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,630
You have made yourself a hearty meal.

162
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,110
<i>Of course.</i>

163
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,350
A healthy body leads to a healthy life.

164
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,980
That goes without saying.

165
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,830
<i>Right.</i>

166
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,550
You need to take care of yourself.

167
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,510
You're out there.

168
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,510
<i>I don't request anything,</i>

169
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,780
but you need to eat well

170
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,590
and take good care of yourself,
do you hear me?

171
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,870
<i>Girl,</i>

172
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,630
<i>how is</i>

173
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,580
Liang Mu Ze's house?

174
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,950
Do you still want to move out?

175
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,550
I do.

176
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,420
<i>When are you going to move out?</i>

177
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,270
<i>How's your house-hunting?</i>

178
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
I can come over to help you

179
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,070
if you're not free.

180
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,110
<i>Never mind.</i>

181
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,150
<i>The house...</i>

182
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,270
I've already found one.

183
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,190
It's very near to our hospital

184
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,630
<i>and the environment is good.</i>

185
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,510
<i>I like the renovation as well.</i>

186
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,620
<i>The point is</i>

187
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,900
<i>the landlord is not in the country.</i>

188
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,550
He is unfamiliar with the domestic market.

189
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,630
The fee is over

190
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,990
one-third below the market rates.

191
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,590
It's cost-effective.

192
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,990
I see.

193
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,230
That's great.

194
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,470
Then I'll tell Mu Min.

195
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,070
No, don't...

196
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,020
Mum.

197
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,430
<i>Son, what are you doing?</i>

198
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,270
I'm going to sleep.

199
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,750
Sleep?

200
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,180
Are you sleeping alone

201
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,630
or sleeping with someone?

202
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,590
Mum, I'm in the unit.

203
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,390
I know that.

204
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,100
How is it?
What progress are you two making?

205
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,190
It's good.

206
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,230
How good is it?

207
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,230
How good is it?

208
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,350
When we're at home,

209
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,860
she cooks,

210
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,030
I wash the dishes.

211
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,710
<i>And then,</i>

212
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,590
<i>we go for a ride.</i>

213
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,510
<i>Both of us</i>

214
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,830
<i>know each other's job.</i>

215
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,070
<i>What a relief!</i>

216
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,310
We talk every chance we have.

217
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,350
<i>Move out</i>

218
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,870
<i>from my house in one week.</i>

219
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,300
It's very good.

220
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,270
Really, very good.

221
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,470
<i>Is it?</i>

222
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,790
Yes, we're good.

223
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,310
<i>Then why did her mother tell me</i>

224
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,830
that she found a rental

225
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,910
and that she's ready
to move out to live alone?

226
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,780
<i>Really?</i>

227
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,910
What do you mean?

228
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,390
Stop playing dumb!

229
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,390
She didn't tell me that.

230
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,430
What's going on?

231
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,030
<i>Did you tell her</i>

232
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,110
<i>that you have a son?</i>

233
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,630
Did you?

234
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,430
Liang Mu Ze,

235
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,110
I think you're crazy.

236
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,350
I'm not... I...

237
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,260
I... My reception... I...

238
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,710
<i>Hello, Mum,
I've got bad reception here. Hello?</i>

239
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,230
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you this.

240
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,870
If you dare to kick her out,

241
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,830
I'll find you a new tenant right away.

242
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,030
Too much noise, I can't hear you.

243
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,550
I can't hear you.

244
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,230
<i>You wait and see!</i>

245
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,790
The reception is bad.

246
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,700
I'm sure

247
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,020
I can still deal with you.

248
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,390
I can't hear you.

249
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,590
Mum...

250
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,350
<i>Liang Mu Ze!</i>

251
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,270
Mum...

252
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,230
This brat!

253
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,190
<i>Old lady</i>

254
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,030
You had trouble sleeping too?

255
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,950
What do you mean?

256
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,110
You can't sleep,

257
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,230
but I'm just waiting to sleep.

258
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,550
How's your preparation
for the assessment?

259
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm a bit cringed but
I don't want to give up.

260
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,990
Then just go on.

261
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,470
But I'm afraid that
I'll affect the result of the team.

262
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,550
"Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share".

263
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,830
Is this how they said?

264
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,750
The recruits line up,
the Special Forces Brigade

265
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,710
Hunter Military School, Isaia,

266
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,470
we are brothers.

267
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,740
I leave my life to you,
the result means nothing.

268
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,510
What's after that?

269
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,540
What do you mean?

270
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,710
How does the poem continue?

271
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,190
Captain Liang,
I wish you could hear yourself.

272
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,910
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

273
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,110
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our armour suit and spear shine.

274
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,110
We move forward, your hand in mine.

275
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,670
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

276
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,350
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our armour suit and spear shine.

277
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,020
We move forward, your hand in mine.

278
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,100
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?

279
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,670
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

280
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,150
Our Sire sends the troops,

281
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,620
let’s make our armour suit
and spear shine.

282
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,150
We move forward, your hand in mine.

283
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,110
The age of death of the deceased is

284
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,990
in the range between 40 to 45 years old.

285
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,540
The cause of death

286
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,750
is haemorrhagic shock

287
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,310
due to the gunshot wound on the chest.

288
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,830
From the deceased's skin wound

289
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,070
and the residue,

290
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,550
the deceased was

291
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,630
bitten by a large dog after he died.

292
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,670
But this is not the most crucial point.

293
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,780
The most crucial point is that

294
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,740
from the pathological anatomy,

295
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,830
I found

296
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
the deceased had suffered

297
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,150
from a very severe kidney disease.

298
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,950
He even needed a kidney transplant.

299
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,180
Transplant?

300
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,150
Yes.

301
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,110
Moreover,

302
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,870
the deceased and the data

303
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,110
sent by the Interpol

304
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,790
of the seriously wounded person

305
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,230
who was almost kidnapped

306
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,990
in Isaia Joint Medical outpost,

307
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,270
are highly matched,

308
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,990
no matter if it's their
ABO RBC blood group

309
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,110
or MHC antigen.

310
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,900
<i>Rao Zhi,</i>

311
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,790
there's been a murder
in Jiaotong University's district.

312
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,990
Okay, noted.

313
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,270
I'm going to the scene.

314
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,980
We'll talk about it later.

315
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,950
Okay.

316
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,350
Let's go.

317
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,190
Take a look in there. Yes.

318
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,860
Rao Zhi,

319
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,430
how is it?

320
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,340
It's in there.

321
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,550

322
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,180

it might be difficult.

326
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,870
Okay, noted.

327
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,750
Go a little further.

328
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,110

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,070
<i>I think we should repair the ASD.</i>

376
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,510
<i>No.</i>

377
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,430
<i>The heart rate and blood pressure
of the patient are unstable.</i>

378
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,470
<i>He can't undergo cardiac surgery.</i>

379
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,070
Why did it fail?

380
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,430
How could it fail?

381
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,950
There shouldn't have been no problem
about the surgical plan.

382
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,790
What's the problem?

383
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,430
I don't know.

384
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,910
It would be great if I knew it.

385
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,190
Xia Chu,

386
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,390
do you know that?

387
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,710
The responsibility of a doctor

388
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,620
is to relieve often,

389
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,270
to comfort always,

390
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,870
to cure sometimes.

391
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,390
It means that

392
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,670
medicine

393
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,460
has boundaries that we can't reach.

394
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,540
Doctor is not God.

395
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,670
I've tried my best.

396
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,830
Really.

397
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,470
Perhaps the God of Fortune

398
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,390
is not on our side this time.

399
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,430
Then...

400
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,070
Then what should we do next?

401
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,590
When he has recovered,

402
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,430
we'll repair the atrial septal defect

403
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,070
and the surgery of the pulmonary artery.

404
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,580
But

405
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,430
his cardiopulmonary function
was seriously damaged.

406
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,070
Can he really withstand the trauma?

407
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,670
I hope so.

408
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,710
How's your wound?

409
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,390
It's fully recovered.

410
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,950
Then why did you act like
you were dying during the assessment?

411
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,070
Why would your strength
be reinforced otherwise?

412
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,750
Xiao Jun's condition is not good.

413
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,150
Have you asked the doctor?

414
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,870
No.

415
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,590
What about giving a call?

416
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,150
I'm scared.

417
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,070
13944822375

418
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,870
It's Dr Xia's number.

419
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,910
I have Zhang Yi Chi's number,
why would I ask her?

420
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,860
Dr Xia is prettier.

421
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,110
You're shallow.

422
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,550
I can get over it.

423
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,430
You can do it too,

424
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,310
sooner or later.

425
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,540
<i>Mu Ze.</i>

426
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,150
What would you do

427
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,670
if you knew Xiao Jun's operation

428
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,430
didn't work?

429
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,510
Call the doctor

430
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,670
to ask about the reason why it didn't work

431
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,470
and the next arrangement of the operation

432
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,950
to start an early preparation.

433
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,670
Right, it should be like this.

434
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,710
And you'll comfort
Xiao Jun and your sister-in-law.

435
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,310
You'll tell them

436
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,310
that you'll protect them,

437
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,420
even if the sky falls.

438
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,150
You've always been like this, right?

439
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,830
What are you holding back for?

440
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,790
I'm not sure.

441
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,630
I'll be scared

442
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,710
if it's a very bad result.

443
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,710
Will you?

444
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,270
I will.

445
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,270
Then what should I do?

446
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,110
I dare to stand in front of you

447
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,870
because I know

448
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,310
you're right behind me.

449
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,310
You too.

450
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,670
Go find your comrade

451
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,100
and fight with them.

452
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,830
<i>It's me.</i>

453
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,510
I'm looking for the house.

454
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,110
<i>It's not about the house.</i>

455
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,710
It's about Xiao Jun.

456
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,150
So you know.

457
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,470
The reason of the failure

458
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,390
is not known yet.

459
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,230
I have no idea

460
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,990
why it became like this.

461
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,550
Perhaps that's what
clinical practice is like.

462
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,189
<i>Even if</i>

463
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:16,750
<i>we're well-prepared,</i>

464
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,109
<i>there might still</i>

465
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,790
<i>be a probability to fail.</i>

466
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,629
<i>We are making the second surgical plan.</i>

467
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,750
<i>It needs some time.</i>

468
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,510
No matter if you believe it or not,

469
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,109
I still want to say

470
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,950
actually,

471
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,550
we, the doctors, are the ones who wish

472
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,589
more than anyone else
that the patient could be safe

473
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:43,870
every time we send them
to the operating room.

474
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,390
We...

475
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm sorry.

476
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,790
Anything else?

477
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,990
If you have nothing to ask, I'll...

478
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,230
<i>800-meter road with obstacles.</i>

479
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,790
When I reached two-thirds of it,

480
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,870
I thought I couldn't do it.

481
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,740
8000-meter mazy run.

482
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,870
When I reached the final mile,

483
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,070
Tian Yong was hurt.

484
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,150
I carried him.

485
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,030
I knew he was hurt.

486
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,070
And he knew I was exhausted.

487
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,030
<i>But the reason I carried him
and ran to the finish line</i>

488
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,910
was only because he wished

489
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,870
to be on the field.

490
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,910
What are you trying to say,
Liang Mu Ze?

491
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,110
Xiao Jun is only eight years old.

492
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,030
I know the hospital is not my battlefield.

493
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,150
Now I also know that

494
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,230
<i>doctors</i>

495
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,470
<i>are irreplaceable.</i>

496
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,910
So I ask you

497
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,790
not to give up

498
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,390
on Xiao Jun

499
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,830
no matter what,

500
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,310
<i>okay?</i>

501
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,430
I got it.

502
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,390
I'll pass your message to Dr Zhang.

503
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,630
Thank you.

504
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,430
Dr Zhang.

505
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,110
I just finished an operation
and came here to see Xiao Jun.

506
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,990
You've worked hard.

507
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,230
What did you buy?

508
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,230
A customer ordered a bracelet from me.

509
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,790
She was eager to get it so I went out

510
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,470
to buy some accessories.

511
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,110
I heard it from Mu Ze

512
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,870
that you've opened a book store.

513
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,510
Opening a book store is my hobby.

514
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,390
I sell some clothes

515
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,980
designed by me
and some freelance designers

516
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,030
in the store.

517
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,390
And I sell some
cultural and creative products too.

518
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,670
Dreaming is important,

519
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,350
but it's important to earn a living too.

520
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,310
Don't you think, Dr Zhang?

521
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,350
Dr Zhang,

522
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,070
does Xiao Jun still have a chance?

523
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,230
Will you be willing to try

524
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,790
if we arrange a cardiac surgery

525
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,070
for Xiao Jun?

526
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,030
For his current situation,

527
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,310
it might be hard

528
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,070
to proceed with an interventional surgery.

529
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,630
I think

530
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,350
we're more confident

531
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,550
on performing a surgery.

532
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,710
I follow your decision.

533
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,030
I feel bad for him

534
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,110
as he has to suffer a lot

535
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,710
at this young age,

536
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,950
but you are a doctor.

537
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,420
I believe in your choice

538
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,950
as long as Xiao Jun can be cured.

539
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,070
I trust you, Dr Zhang.

540
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,390
I understand.

541
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,150
Who is it?

542
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,190
It's early.

543
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,230
Coming!

544
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,110
Why have you come here?

545
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,470
I want to sleep on my half Tatami.

546
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,470
Have you had breakfast?

547
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,670
Yes.

548
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,270
Don't mind me, carry on.

549
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,070
There are food and beverages
in the fridge, help yourself.

550
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,750
Okay.

551
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,350
Didn't you tell me that

552
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,310
you're really busy
preparing for the surgery?

553
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,310
The surgery didn't work.

554
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,430
Why?

555
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,670
I don't know.

556
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,310
Perhaps it's often the case.

557
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,830
The patient whom the doctors

558
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,950
pay a lot of attention to

559
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,870
might not have a positive outcome.

560
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,910
I increasingly find that

561
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,990
what we can do is very limited.

562
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,310
I think

563
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,750
something's wrong
with the Feng Shui of your house.

564
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,550
Did you get someone
to read the geomancy?

565
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,470
Why don't

566
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,950
you move out?

567
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,030
I wish too.

568
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,310
But the other houses are more terrifying.

569
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,430
Come to our district.

570
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,190
There's a unit in our district,

571
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,350
it has the same layout as mine.

572
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,300
It's right above us.

573
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,070
Does it have
a floor-to-ceiling window too?

574
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,510
It does.

575
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,230
That...

576
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,220
He gave me this at that day

577
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,100
after you left.

578
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,550
To get your news.

579
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,940
I was thinking

580
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,470
to throw it away,

581
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,430
but then I thought

582
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,030
he might not mean any harm.

583
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,430
It's been years after all.

584
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,980
I'll just throw it away.

585
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:36,004
