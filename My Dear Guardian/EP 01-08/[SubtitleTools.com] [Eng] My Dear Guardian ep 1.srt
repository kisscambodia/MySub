12
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,029
Uniform, weapon, blood, lives.

13
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,950
What kind of work

14
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,630
do you associate with these things?

15
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,350
Soldiers.

16
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,790
Us,

17
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,990
the military doctors.

18
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,190
Wouldn't you agree?

19
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:02,900
Okay.

20
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,860
That's it.

21
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,540
That's it?

22
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,500
Yes.

23
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,110
That didn't hurt at all.

24
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,590
You are a big boy now.

25
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,630
No more tears next time.

26
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,790
Okay?

27
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,750
Okay.

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,300
Hello.

29
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,270
Good afternoon.

30
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,550
Hey, beauty.

31
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,590
Hi Eugene, how are you?

32
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,550
You have to hold your breath.
Hold it, yes.

33
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,190
Keep it up, captain.

34
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,580
Keep calm, captain. Steady.

35
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,940
Keep calm, don't panic,
adjust your heart rate.

36
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,300
Very good.

37
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,950
Adjust your heart rate, captain.

38
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,980
Come on, captain.

39
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,620
You can do it.

40
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,580
Thank you.

41
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,870
Keep it up, Captain.

42
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,990
Songpaisarn has already lost.

43
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,590
Hang in there.

44
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,950
Keep it up.

45
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,310
Seven and a half minutes.

46
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,109
Chinese?

47
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,550
Yes, what's the matter?

48
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,790
You don't own the restaurant.

49
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,470
It's fine if you make noise,

50
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,940
but don't spill water on me

51
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,910
nor on the food.

52
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,230
That is very rude.

53
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,270
Well...

54
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,380
I've been locked up for a year.

55
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,750
Please excuse me.

56
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,390
I'll pay for your food.

57
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,430
I've no appetite.

58
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,190
Pretentious.

59
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,190
What did you say?

60
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,180
We are sorry, miss.

61
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,860
He held his breath for too long.

62
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,820
He lost his mind.

63
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,830
No, miss.

64
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,350
I just said that you are

65
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,470
pretentious.

66
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,820
You have a bad temper.

67
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,020
You are very quick.

68
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,350
Let's go, urgent mission. Let's go.

69
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,780
Dr Zhang.

70
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,500
Where are you, Xia Chu?

71
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,470
An explosion on Reman Bridge.

72
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,390
A lot of wounded people will be arriving
at the hospital soon.

73
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,830
We need manpower.

74
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,950
Come back now.

75
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,270
Okay, I'll be right back.

76
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,390
Dr Zhang.

77
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,830
I am already downstairs.

78
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,110
Okay, I'm coming.

79
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,750
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,390
Wait.

81
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,230
Where are you taking him?

82
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,470
Sorry, I can't understand what you said.

83
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,140
I need to call.

84
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,870
I need to call to confirm.

85
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,620
There. There they are.

86
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,910
They are taking my husband.

87
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,550
Hey, you!

88
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,030
Dagon.

89
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,820
Calling! Calling!

90
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,910
Terrorists in the hospital.

91
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,870
Dagon.

92
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,110
Dagon.

93
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,140
Dagon.

94
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,380
Hold on.

95
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,500
The mission has changed.

96
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,100
We'll head to Isaia Hospital now

97
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,910
and rescue hostages with the local police.

98
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,580
The attack on Reman Bridge

99
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,629
is suspected to be

100
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,259
a diversion by the T4 group.

101
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,390
Boss, the police have surrounded us.

102
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,230
The helicopter will be here in 15 minutes.

103
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,660
Get ready to negotiate with the police.

104
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,750
Let's go. Let's go.

105
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,710
Go! Go! Go! Let's move.

106
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,430
Liang Mu Ze.

107
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,550
What's the situation now, Dr Zhang?

108
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,350
A Chinese

109
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,430
resident doctor is

110
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,550
being held hostage.

111
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,950
There are more than

112
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,190
ten terrorists.

113
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,550
A few of them are wearing

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,830
lab coats.

115
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,990
How many hostages in total?

116
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,070
More than ten.

117
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,110
Come with me.

118
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,220
Be careful.

119
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,350
Our first round was busted.

120
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,190
These guys are savages.

121
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,030
Every five minutes they'll kill a hostage.

122
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,230
We'll have to

123
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,670
play by their rules for now.

124
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,750
The clock's ticking.

125
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,310
You've got 15 minutes
to rescue the hostages.

126
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,030
Boss, he's not good.

127
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,390
You.

128
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,220
A doctor?

129
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,020
Yes.

130
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,990
Stop the bleeding.

131
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,310
No.

132
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,390
Come on.

133
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,390
Come on.

134
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,110
What did you do?

135
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,830
Wait.

136
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,030
I'm a doctor.

137
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,390
I'm going to treat him.

138
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,430
Please, no more killing.

139
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,510
Come on.

140
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,070
Okay.

141
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,390
Let me check.

142
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,950
Please help me.

143
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,150
Take it easy.

144
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,310
I need to stop the bleeding.

145
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,670
I need morphine.

146
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,990
A doctor

147
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,620
never hurts their patients, right?

148
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,900
No, we don't.

149
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,870
I need help.

150
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,350
Relax.

151
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,470
It's finished.

152
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,830
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

153
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,710
He's okay.

154
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,430
Good job.

155
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,990
Thank you.

156
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,190
Tian Yong.

157
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,029
Tian Yong.

158
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,420
Doctor, help!

159
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,819
Who's the doctor?

160
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,230
Tian Yong.

161
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,590
Help! Who's the doctor?

162
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,100
Doctor.

163
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,550
I...

164
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,270
I am.

165
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,870
Help him.

166
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,470
Are you okay?

167
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,590
He was shot in the chest.

168
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,340
The bleeding is heavy.

169
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,630
The bullet is in the chest.

170
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,620
Immediately for surgery.

171
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,590
Hurry up.

172
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,260
Perform

173
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,110
pericardiocentesis,

174
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,350
peripheral and deep vein catheter.

175
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,550
Prepare intubation

176
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,500
and forceps.

177
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,470
Okay.

178
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,300
What's wrong?

179
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,710
My hand hurts.

180
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,110
Where's the anaesthetist?

181
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,270
There are many wounded people today.
We don't have enough manpower.

182
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,470
Dr Zhang.

183
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,150
Let me try.

184
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,430
You?

185
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,100
I did an anaesthesia training.

186
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,940
Hurry up.

187
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,030
Yes.

188
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,230
Here.

189
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,510
Thanks.

190
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,230
He's going to be okay, buddy.

191
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,110
He's a Chinese soldier.

192
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,190
20mcg of noradrenaline intravenous
every minute.

193
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,710
-Prepare the blood.
-Yes.

194
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,350
-Xia Chu.
-I know.

195
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,910
Draw out the blood.

196
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,420
Pump it back

197
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,390
through the jugular vein.

198
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,300
Very good.

199
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,270
Open the chest.

201
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,710
It's here, I found it.

202
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,430
The bullet pierced

203
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,350
through the pericardium
and visceral layers from the edge

204
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,350
and embedded in the myocardium.

205
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,590
Luckily,

206
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,710
it didn't pierce the heart.

207
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,350
There's only a thin crack

208
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,780
in between.

209
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,750
This guy is very lucky.

210
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,270
Tweezers.

211
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,220
No wonder the blood

212
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,190
is not gushing.

213
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,740
It slowly seeps in instead.

214
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,110
It gives us ample time to rescue him.

215
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,150
-We are lucky.
-Haemostat.

216
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,830
What's wrong? Feeling dizzy?

217
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,710
No.

218
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,030
I'm just a little scared.

219
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,270
Relax.

220
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,910
Let me tell you.

221
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,350
There was an officer who suffered

222
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,270
a more serious injury than him.

223
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,310
He was shot twice and had stab wounds.

224
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,150
Fractures too.

225
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,630
After the surgery,

226
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,190
he recovered in half a year.

227
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,550
And

228
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,910
without any side effects.

229
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,390
Good, hold it.

230
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,630
Good, hold it.

231
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,190
Okay.

232
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,110
We've done it.

233
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,110
Okay.

234
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,630
Needle.

235
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,350
Good. It's completed.

236
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,260
Fifteen minutes faster

237
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,380
than estimated.

238
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,070
What do you think?

239
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,830
Do you think I'm good?

240
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,750
You are my idol.

241
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,870
Okay.

242
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,670
When you go back, don't forget

243
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,150
to introduce

244
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,270
a girlfriend to me.

245
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,870
Okay.

246
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,230
How was it?

247
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,190
The operation was very successful.

248
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,030
After the observation period,

249
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,750
I'll send him to ICU.

250
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,110
If he gets through today,

251
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,710
he shouldn't have any problem.

252
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,380
He still needs to endure today?

253
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,550
I drank it.

254
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,910
I am thirsty.

255
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,150
Captain Liang.

256
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,750
When he stabilises,

257
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,750
I suggest

258
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,390
you send him back immediately.

259
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,030
The conditions here aren't ideal.

260
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,550
Okay.

261
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,260
We've sent

262
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,670
your comrade to the ICU.

263
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,550
Wait.

264
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,030
Listen to me first.

265
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,350
I don't have time to listen to a fool.

266
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,950
What?

267
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,660
Because of your crazy action,

268
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,100
my friend was shot.

269
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,710
I'm very sorry

270
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,230
about your friend.

271
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,660
But you know exactly

272
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,710
what happened.

273
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,150
When that terrorist

274
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,100
tried to shoot,

275
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,940
I was really worried

276
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,420
more people would get hurt.

277
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,260
That's why

278
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,140
I tried to stop him.

279
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,020
We were carrying out a rescue mission.

280
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,100
As a hostage, you just stay where you are.

281
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,270
I know.

282
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,390
But the situation was changing rapidly.

283
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,990
I was trying to help.

284
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,390
We don't need your help.

285
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,950
We are trained soldiers.

286
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,500
This is our battlefield.

287
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,140
As a hostage, you only need

288
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,540
to stay calm and cooperate.

289
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,790
What were you thinking?

290
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,860
You are a professional soldier.

291
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,180
I am a professional doctor.

292
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,270
I'm a soldier too.

293
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,990
I knew that terrorist was injured.

294
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,630
I made a judgement call.

295
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,180
I thought I could stop him.

296
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,510
What was the result?

297
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,350
A bullet pierced his heart.

298
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,830
I'll take care of him in ICU.

299
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,110
I'll make sure he is all right.

300
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,550
Maybe I didn't keep my cool.

301
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,590
I didn't do well.

302
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,420
Once again, I'm sorry.

303
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,390
But I want to let you know.

304
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,660
It's your battlefield

305
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,870
and mine too.

306
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,070
I always try my best to help.

307
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,230
Did you bandage the terrorist's wound?

308
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,820
Yes.

309
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,190
You did your utmost to save the terrorist,

310
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,580
they tried their best to kill us.

311
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,500
I've already told you.

312
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,750
This wasn't my intention.

313
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,030
At that moment,

314
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,940
he was an injured man

315
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,070
who needed help.

316
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,180
I'm telling you, this is a battlefield.

317
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,380
An enemy on the battlefield
is an enemy indeed.

318
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,620
The Geneva Conventions

319
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,540
must be obeyed.

320
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,060
I've taken

321
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,460
the Hippocratic Oath.

322
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,380
Unless I get an order from my superior,

323
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,230
my specialization

324
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,230
requires me to save
who is in mortal danger.

325
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,550
I don't care about that.

326
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,380
You are

327
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,100
not qualified to be a soldier

328
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,070
nor a doctor.

329
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,870
What?

330
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,910
Apologise to me.

331
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,710
Are you crazy?

332
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,230
You must apologise to me.

333
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,430
You can't insult my specialization.

334
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,190
You can't question...

335
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,230
What're you doing?

336
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,230
Release me.

337
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,390
You're a crazy man!

338
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,590
Come back.

339
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,670
Let go of me.

340
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,030
Come back.

341
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,710
Which unit are you from, 2467?

342
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,350
Come back, let go of me.

343
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,110
I'll make a complaint.

344
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,370
<i>One week later.
Special Forces Brigade in Ningjiang</i>

345
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,590
Brigade Commander.

346
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,750
Brigade Commander.

347
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,230
So?

348
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,270
Have you reflected on your problem?

349
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,700
Yes.

350
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,340
Then tell me.

351
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,310
I represent China mainland's
special forces

352
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,790
in the Hunter Military School.

353
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm one of the 14 soldiers

354
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,670
who have completed all subjects,

355
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,390
but I'm ranked number two.

356
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,580
My grades are poor.

357
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,190
-That's all?
-That's all.

358
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,550
Fine, you can continue to stay.

359
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,470
Yes, there is more.

360
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,380
Say it.

361
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,390
There's also that doctor's complaint
about me.

362
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,910
What about?

363
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,190
It has spread throughout the war zone.

364
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,950
You tied up a doctor

365
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,750
from the medical team in Isaia.

366
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,830
What have you done, Liang Mu Ze?

367
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,870
No, Sir.

368
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,260
Tian Yong almost died

369
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,340
because of her.

370
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,310
She's a hostage you must protect.

371
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,350
Brigade Commander.

372
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,830
As a joint operations commander,

373
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,260
I must ensure

374
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,550
the safety of the hostages

375
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,620
and

376
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,790
of my comrades.

377
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,060
So, you mean you are right?

378
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,910
You did nothing wrong, correct?

379
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,620
No, Sir.

380
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,350
Calm down.

381
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,950
Watch your blood pressure.

382
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,430
Don't make excuses.

383
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,670
Watch your behaviour.

384
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,750
I've completed my self-reflection report,
Brigade Commander.

385
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,350
Liang Mu Ze.

386
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,190
Do you really

387
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,630
admit your mistake this time?

388
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,310
Yes, I do.

389
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,310
-If I do it again...
-It's fine.

390
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,620
Do 500 push-ups.

391
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,060
Go home

392
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,500
after you have completed them.

393
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,510
Continue to reflect.

394
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,990
-Yes.
-And

395
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,070
after completing

396
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,590
Tian Yong's hospitalisation,

397
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,460
-return to the unit.
-Yes.

398
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,670
<i>My son.</i>

399
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,870
<i>Mr Dong said he approved your leave.</i>

400
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,830
<i>That's great.</i>

401
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,460
<i>You should think about</i>

402
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,030
<i>your personal issues.</i>

403
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,660
<i>By the way,</i>

404
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,710
<i>we found you a housemate.</i>

405
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,950
<i>It's my friend's child.</i>

406
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,030
<i>I hope
you can get along with each other.</i>

407
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,420
How are you?

408
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,990
I'll visit you one day.

409
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,950
Can you share the table?

410
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,430
I have no choice.

411
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,270
Don't worry about me.

412
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,910
I never hear anything.

413
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,750
I don't know.

414
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,470
He can share the table.

415
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,790
I don't know.

416
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,110
Thank you.

417
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,670
Can I take your order?

418
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,150
Let me have a look.

419
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,470
Talk to you later.

420
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,830
Goodbye.

421
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,310
Don't pretend.

422
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,820
If you want to apologise,
wait till I'm done.

423
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,790
Apologise?

424
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,030
Are you apologising to me?

425
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,950
Were you punished?

426
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,390
Are you upset?

427
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,710
It's fine.

428
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,670
Men grow up in blows.

429
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,750
I don't want to share the table.

430
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,830
You can leave.

431
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,910
This is my table.

432
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,470
Then leave with your table.

433
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,670
Are you ready to order?

434
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,780
-Yes.
-Okra.

435
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,750
Chicken.

436
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,750
Tofu.

437
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,100
Salted egg yolk bun.

438
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,910
Okay.

439
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,940
We have one bun left.

441
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,430
He ordered it first.

442
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,150
Put it here.

443
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,620
What's wrong?

444
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,460
What's wrong?

445
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,140
It's my boyfriend.

446
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,190
My boyfriend choked on the beef.

447
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,070
Put him over the back of the chair.

448
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,580
No.

449
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,580
Punch him.

450
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,540
A hollow punch.

451
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,150
Punch where?

452
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,110
In the stomach.

453
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,070
How are you?

454
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,070
Thank you.

455
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,350
It feels good.

456
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,589
What a poor kitten.

457
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,270
Why are you here?

458
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,109
Were you abandoned?

459
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,149
Do you want me to bring you home?

460
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,430
<i>Bring me home, miss.</i>

461
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,550
I don't have my own place.

462
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,950
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,629
Goodbye.

464
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,310
I don't care.

465
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,430
Let's take a bath.

466
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,740
It's very cute, for real.

467
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,910
<i>No, it's not.</i>

468
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,660
<i>Do you know how many parasites</i>

469
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,630
<i>a cat has?</i>

470
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,470
I have de-wormed it.

471
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,270
No.

472
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,230
That house was lent to you

473
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,390
by Mu Min.

474
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,540
I know, I know.

475
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,790
I'll be very careful.

476
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,190
I remember locking it.

477
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,870
<i>What did you say?</i>

478
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,030
I'll talk to you later, Mum.

479
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,950
Xia Chu.

480
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,390
<i>Oh my, what a handsome man.</i>

481
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,350
It's you.

482
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,510
Why are you here?

483
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,380
This is my house.

484
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,470
Are you Mu Min's son?

485
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,550
Yes.

486
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,620
Didn't you say

487
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,300
the house was vacant?

488
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,340
Liang Mu Ze appeared

489
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,790
when I moved in.

490
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,910
<i>Isn't that normal?</i>

491
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,070
<i>He is the actual owner.</i>

492
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,750
If you aren't willing,

493
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,150
you can move out.

494
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,540
<i>Move again?</i>

495
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,070
<i>I just moved in.</i>

496
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,470
I've moved multiple times

497
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,070
since I graduated.

498
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,620
Xia Chu is a girl.

499
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,540
Of course,

500
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,510
she's a girl.

501
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,070
Didn't I tell you?

502
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,110
You said he's a guy.

503
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,660
<i>When did I tell you he's a guy?</i>

504
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,340
<i>I don't care.</i>

505
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,470
<i>She already stopped
renting her old place.</i>

506
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,740
<i>Furthermore,</i>

507
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,070
<i>do you want to see her
live on the street?</i>

508
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,150
They have a hostel in the hospital.

509
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,110
The application time is already over.

510
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,910
Or

511
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,350
you can come home.

512
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,140
You can be a doctor here.

513
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,470
Why would you go to such a faraway place?

514
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,830
You should know.

515
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,860
When I married your dad,

516
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,310
her mum came to help me

517
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,430
in Dong'an.

518
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,910
What does it have to do with me?

519
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,140
You can take care

520
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,670
of each other.

521
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,950
It's a complicated society outside.

522
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,420
<i>You have two choices.</i>

523
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,180
<i>You can choose to stay,</i>

524
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,380
<i>or you can come back to Dong'an.</i>

525
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,750
<i>It's no use.</i>

526
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,940
When I bought the house,

527
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,710
I wanted you to get married soon.

528
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,230
I heard

529
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,550
her son

530
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,950
is an officer.

531
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,470
How does she look like?

532
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,550
Is she pretty?

533
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,150
What are you thinking, Mum?

534
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,950
What do you think?

535
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,590
Or...

536
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,870
<i>I can get your grandfather
to inquire about him</i>

537
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,670
<i>in his unit.</i>

538
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,580
Miss Lan.

539
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,310
Don't create problems for me.

540
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,940
It's my problem.

541
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,870
I can solve it myself.

542
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,580
Do you want some noodles?

543
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,750
Yes, I do.

544
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,190
You forgot to add salt.

545
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,150
I did add it. A little bit.

546
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,940
Too much salt is not healthy.

547
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,030
Not more than 5g per person every day.

548
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,390
Xia Chu.

549
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,430
I must talk to you.

550
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,630
Wait until I'm done.

551
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,430
This is my lunch.

552
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,790
I'm going to the hospital.

553
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,270
What do you want to discuss?

554
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,030
First of all, which room do you stay in?

555
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,470
This one.

556
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,870
Are you sure?

557
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,470
Mu Min told me I can use

558
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,510
the bathroom in the master bedroom.

559
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,380
So, when you are not home,

560
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,350
occasionally,

561
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,460
only once in a while,

562
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,140
I can use your bathtub.

563
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,270
Secondly.

564
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:42,740
What's this?

565
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,350
<i>Don't be so rough.</i>

566
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,750
<i>You are hurting me.</i>

567
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,700
Don't hold it this way.

568
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,020
It'll be scared.

569
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,790
It's a cat that I picked up.

570
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,870
You can keep the cat,

571
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,900
but I don't want to see

572
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,380
any faeces in the room.

573
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,670
No fur and no smell.

574
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,900
Don't worry,

575
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,300
cats are cleaner than humans.

576
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,590
Thirdly,

577
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,390
you can use my bathroom.

578
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,830
But you must pack things up.

579
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,390
Is this yours?

580
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,020
My memory padded bra.

581
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,510
I thought I lost it.

582
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,630
Where was it?

583
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,030
In my dryer.

584
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,790
It's so dirty.

585
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,190
Okay.

586
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,350
Lastly, number four, which is also

587
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,940
the most important.

588
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,910
Listen clearly.

589
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,990
Move out from here

590
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,510
in one week time.

591
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,910
What?

592
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,990
Move out.

593
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,700
You ate my noodles just now.

594
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,660
Have you forgotten?

595
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,230
I remember. It wasn't tasty.

596
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,150
Do you really want me to move out?

597
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,780
Why did you

598
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,340
talk so much just now?

599
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,870
Just go straight to the fourth point.

600
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,660
To see

601
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,870
your shocking look.

602
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,510
It feels good.

603
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,670
I can pay the rent.

604
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,870
I don't need money.

605
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,190
Liang Mu Ze.

606
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,140
If you can't afford one,

607
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,110
tell me.

608
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,150
I'll find you a moving company.

609
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,270
Liang Mu Ze.
