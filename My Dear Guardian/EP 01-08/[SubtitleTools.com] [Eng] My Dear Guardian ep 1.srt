12
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,829
Uniform, weapon, blood, lives.

13
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,750
What kind of work

14
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,430
do you associate with these things?

15
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,150
Soldiers.

16
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,590
Us,

17
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,790
the military doctors.

18
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,990
Wouldn't you agree?

19
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:02,700
Okay.

20
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,660
That's it.

21
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,340
That's it?

22
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,300
Yes.

23
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,910
That didn't hurt at all.

24
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,390
You are a big boy now.

25
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,430
No more tears next time.

26
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,590
Okay?

27
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,550
Okay.

28
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,100
Hello.

29
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,070
Good afternoon.

30
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,350
Hey, beauty.

31
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,390
Hi Eugene, how are you?

32
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,350
You have to hold your breath.
Hold it, yes.

33
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,990
Keep it up, captain.

34
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,380
Keep calm, captain. Steady.

35
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,740
Keep calm, don't panic,
adjust your heart rate.

36
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,100
Very good.

37
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,750
Adjust your heart rate, captain.

38
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,780
Come on, captain.

39
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,420
You can do it.

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,380
Thank you.

41
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,670
Keep it up, Captain.

42
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,790
Songpaisarn has already lost.

43
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,390
Hang in there.

44
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,750
Keep it up.

45
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,110
Seven and a half minutes.

46
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,909
Chinese?

47
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,350
Yes, what's the matter?

48
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,590
You don't own the restaurant.

49
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,270
It's fine if you make noise,

50
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,740
but don't spill water on me

51
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,710
nor on the food.

52
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,030
That is very rude.

53
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,070
Well...

54
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,180
I've been locked up for a year.

55
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,550
Please excuse me.

56
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,190
I'll pay for your food.

57
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,230
I've no appetite.

58
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,990
Pretentious.

59
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,990
What did you say?

60
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,980
We are sorry, miss.

61
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,660
He held his breath for too long.

62
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,620
He lost his mind.

63
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,630
No, miss.

64
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,150
I just said that you are

65
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,270
pretentious.

66
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,620
You have a bad temper.

67
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,820
You are very quick.

68
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,150
Let's go, urgent mission. Let's go.

69
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,580
Dr Zhang.

70
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,300
Where are you, Xia Chu?

71
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,270
An explosion on Reman Bridge.

72
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,190
A lot of wounded people will be arriving
at the hospital soon.

73
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,630
We need manpower.

74
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,750
Come back now.

75
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,070
Okay, I'll be right back.

76
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,190
Dr Zhang.

77
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,630
I am already downstairs.

78
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,910
Okay, I'm coming.

79
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,550
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,190
Wait.

81
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,030
Where are you taking him?

82
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,270
Sorry, I can't understand what you said.

83
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,940
I need to call.

84
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,670
I need to call to confirm.

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,420
There. There they are.

86
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,710
They are taking my husband.

87
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,350
Hey, you!

88
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,830
Dagon.

89
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,620
Calling! Calling!

90
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,710
Terrorists in the hospital.

91
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,670
Dagon.

92
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,910
Dagon.

93
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,940
Dagon.

94
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,180
Hold on.

95
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,300
The mission has changed.

96
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,900
We'll head to Isaia Hospital now

97
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,710
and rescue hostages with the local police.

98
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,380
The attack on Reman Bridge

99
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,429
is suspected to be

100
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,059
a diversion by the T4 group.

101
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,190
Boss, the police have surrounded us.

102
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,030
The helicopter will be here in 15 minutes.

103
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,460
Get ready to negotiate with the police.

104
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,550
Let's go. Let's go.

105
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,510
Go! Go! Go! Let's move.

106
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,230
Liang Mu Ze.

107
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,350
What's the situation now, Dr Zhang?

108
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,150
A Chinese

109
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,230
resident doctor is

110
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,350
being held hostage.

111
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,750
There are more than

112
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,990
ten terrorists.

113
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,350
A few of them are wearing

114
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,630
lab coats.

115
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,790
How many hostages in total?

116
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,870
More than ten.

117
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,910
Come with me.

118
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,020
Be careful.

119
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,150
Our first round was busted.

120
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,990
These guys are savages.

121
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,830
Every five minutes they'll kill a hostage.

122
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,030
We'll have to

123
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,470
play by their rules for now.

124
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,550
The clock's ticking.

125
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,110
You've got 15 minutes
to rescue the hostages.

126
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,830
Boss, he's not good.

127
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,190
You.

128
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,020
A doctor?

129
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,820
Yes.

130
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,790
Stop the bleeding.

131
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,110
No.

132
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,190
Come on.

133
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,190
Come on.

134
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,910
What did you do?

135
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,630
Wait.

136
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,830
I'm a doctor.

137
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,190
I'm going to treat him.

138
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,230
Please, no more killing.

139
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,310
Come on.

140
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,870
Okay.

141
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,190
Let me check.

142
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,750
Please help me.

143
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,950
Take it easy.

144
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,110
I need to stop the bleeding.

145
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,470
I need morphine.

146
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,790
A doctor

147
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,420
never hurts their patients, right?

148
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,700
No, we don't.

149
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,670
I need help.

150
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,150
Relax.

151
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,270
It's finished.

152
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,630
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

153
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,510
He's okay.

154
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,230
Good job.

155
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,790
Thank you.

156
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,990
Tian Yong.

157
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,829
Tian Yong.

158
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,220
Doctor, help!

159
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,619
Who's the doctor?

160
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,030
Tian Yong.

161
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,390
Help! Who's the doctor?

162
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,900
Doctor.

163
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,350
I...

164
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,070
I am.

165
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,670
Help him.

166
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,270
Are you okay?

167
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,390
He was shot in the chest.

168
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,140
The bleeding is heavy.

169
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,430
The bullet is in the chest.

170
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,420
Immediately for surgery.

171
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,390
Hurry up.

172
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,060
Perform

173
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,910
pericardiocentesis,

174
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,150
peripheral and deep vein catheter.

175
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,350
Prepare intubation

176
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,300
and forceps.

177
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,270
Okay.

178
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,100
What's wrong?

179
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,510
My hand hurts.

180
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,910
Where's the anaesthetist?

181
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,070
There are many wounded people today.
We don't have enough manpower.

182
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,270
Dr Zhang.

183
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,950
Let me try.

184
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,230
You?

185
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,900
I did an anaesthesia training.

186
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,740
Hurry up.

187
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,830
Yes.

188
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,030
Here.

189
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,310
Thanks.

190
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,030
He's going to be okay, buddy.

191
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,910
He's a Chinese soldier.

192
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,990
20mcg of noradrenaline intravenous
every minute.

193
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,510
-Prepare the blood.
-Yes.

194
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,150
-Xia Chu.
-I know.

195
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,710
Draw out the blood.

196
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,220
Pump it back

197
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,190
through the jugular vein.

198
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,100
Very good.

199
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,070
Open the chest.

201
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,510
It's here, I found it.

202
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,230
The bullet pierced

203
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,150
through the pericardium
and visceral layers from the edge

204
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,150
and embedded in the myocardium.

205
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,390
Luckily,

206
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,510
it didn't pierce the heart.

207
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,150
There's only a thin crack

208
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,580
in between.

209
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,550
This guy is very lucky.

210
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,070
Tweezers.

211
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,020
No wonder the blood

212
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,990
is not gushing.

213
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,540
It slowly seeps in instead.

214
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,910
It gives us ample time to rescue him.

215
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,950
-We are lucky.
-Haemostat.

216
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,630
What's wrong? Feeling dizzy?

217
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,510
No.

218
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,830
I'm just a little scared.

219
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,070
Relax.

220
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,710
Let me tell you.

221
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,150
There was an officer who suffered

222
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,070
a more serious injury than him.

223
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,110
He was shot twice and had stab wounds.

224
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,950
Fractures too.

225
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,430
After the surgery,

226
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,990
he recovered in half a year.

227
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,350
And

228
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,710
without any side effects.

229
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,190
Good, hold it.

230
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,430
Good, hold it.

231
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,990
Okay.

232
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,910
We've done it.

233
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,910
Okay.

234
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,430
Needle.

235
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,150
Good. It's completed.

236
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,060
Fifteen minutes faster

237
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,180
than estimated.

238
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,870
What do you think?

239
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,630
Do you think I'm good?

240
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,550
You are my idol.

241
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,670
Okay.

242
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,470
When you go back, don't forget

243
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,950
to introduce

244
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,070
a girlfriend to me.

245
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,670
Okay.

246
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,030
How was it?

247
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,990
The operation was very successful.

248
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,830
After the observation period,

249
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,550
I'll send him to ICU.

250
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,910
If he gets through today,

251
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,510
he shouldn't have any problem.

252
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,180
He still needs to endure today?

253
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,350
I drank it.

254
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,710
I am thirsty.

255
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,950
Captain Liang.

256
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,550
When he stabilises,

257
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,550
I suggest

258
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,190
you send him back immediately.

259
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,830
The conditions here aren't ideal.

260
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,350
Okay.

261
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,060
We've sent

262
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,470
your comrade to the ICU.

263
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,350
Wait.

264
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,830
Listen to me first.

265
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,150
I don't have time to listen to a fool.

266
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,750
What?

267
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,460
Because of your crazy action,

268
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,900
my friend was shot.

269
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,510
I'm very sorry

270
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,030
about your friend.

271
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,460
But you know exactly

272
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,510
what happened.

273
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,950
When that terrorist

274
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,900
tried to shoot,

275
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,740
I was really worried

276
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,220
more people would get hurt.

277
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,060
That's why

278
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,940
I tried to stop him.

279
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,820
We were carrying out a rescue mission.

280
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,900
As a hostage, you just stay where you are.

281
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,070
I know.

282
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,190
But the situation was changing rapidly.

283
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,790
I was trying to help.

284
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,190
We don't need your help.

285
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,750
We are trained soldiers.

286
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,300
This is our battlefield.

287
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,940
As a hostage, you only need

288
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,340
to stay calm and cooperate.

289
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,590
What were you thinking?

290
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,660
You are a professional soldier.

291
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,980
I am a professional doctor.

292
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm a soldier too.

293
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,790
I knew that terrorist was injured.

294
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,430
I made a judgement call.

295
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,980
I thought I could stop him.

296
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,310
What was the result?

297
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,150
A bullet pierced his heart.

298
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,630
I'll take care of him in ICU.

299
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,910
I'll make sure he is all right.

300
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,350
Maybe I didn't keep my cool.

301
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,390
I didn't do well.

302
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,220
Once again, I'm sorry.

303
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,190
But I want to let you know.

304
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,460
It's your battlefield

305
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,670
and mine too.

306
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,870
I always try my best to help.

307
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,030
Did you bandage the terrorist's wound?

308
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,620
Yes.

309
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,990
You did your utmost to save the terrorist,

310
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,380
they tried their best to kill us.

311
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,300
I've already told you.

312
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,550
This wasn't my intention.

313
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,830
At that moment,

314
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,740
he was an injured man

315
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,870
who needed help.

316
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,980
I'm telling you, this is a battlefield.

317
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,180
An enemy on the battlefield
is an enemy indeed.

318
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,420
The Geneva Conventions

319
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,340
must be obeyed.

320
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,860
I've taken

321
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,260
the Hippocratic Oath.

322
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,180
Unless I get an order from my superior,

323
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,030
my specialization

324
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,030
requires me to save
who is in mortal danger.

325
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,350
I don't care about that.

326
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,180
You are

327
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,900
not qualified to be a soldier

328
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,870
nor a doctor.

329
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,670
What?

330
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,710
Apologise to me.

331
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,510
Are you crazy?

332
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,030
You must apologise to me.

333
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,230
You can't insult my specialization.

334
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,990
You can't question...

335
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,030
What're you doing?

336
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,030
Release me.

337
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,190
You're a crazy man!

338
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,390
Come back.

339
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,470
Let go of me.

340
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,830
Come back.

341
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,510
Which unit are you from, 2467?

342
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,150
Come back, let go of me.

343
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,910
I'll make a complaint.

344
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:33,170
<i>One week later.
Special Forces Brigade in Ningjiang</i>

345
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,390
Brigade Commander.

346
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,550
Brigade Commander.

347
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,030
So?

348
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,070
Have you reflected on your problem?

349
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,500
Yes.

350
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,140
Then tell me.

351
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,110
I represent China mainland's
special forces

352
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,590
in the Hunter Military School.

353
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,900
I'm one of the 14 soldiers

354
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,470
who have completed all subjects,

355
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,190
but I'm ranked number two.

356
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,380
My grades are poor.

357
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,990
-That's all?
-That's all.

358
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,350
Fine, you can continue to stay.

359
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,270
Yes, there is more.

360
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,180
Say it.

361
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,190
There's also that doctor's complaint
about me.

362
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,710
What about?

363
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,990
It has spread throughout the war zone.

364
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,750
You tied up a doctor

365
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,550
from the medical team in Isaia.

366
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,630
What have you done, Liang Mu Ze?

367
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,670
No, Sir.

368
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,060
Tian Yong almost died

369
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,140
because of her.

370
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,110
She's a hostage you must protect.

371
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,150
Brigade Commander.

372
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,630
As a joint operations commander,

373
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,060
I must ensure

374
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,350
the safety of the hostages

375
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,420
and

376
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,590
of my comrades.

377
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,860
So, you mean you are right?

378
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,710
You did nothing wrong, correct?

379
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,420
No, Sir.

380
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,150
Calm down.

381
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,750
Watch your blood pressure.

382
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,230
Don't make excuses.

383
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,470
Watch your behaviour.

384
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,550
I've completed my self-reflection report,
Brigade Commander.

385
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,150
Liang Mu Ze.

386
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,990
Do you really

387
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,430
admit your mistake this time?

388
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,110
Yes, I do.

389
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,110
-If I do it again...
-It's fine.

390
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,420
Do 500 push-ups.

391
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,860
Go home

392
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,300
after you have completed them.

393
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,310
Continue to reflect.

394
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,790
-Yes.
-And

395
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,870
after completing

396
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,390
Tian Yong's hospitalisation,

397
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,260
-return to the unit.
-Yes.

398
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,470
<i>My son.</i>

399
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,670
<i>Mr Dong said he approved your leave.</i>

400
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,630
<i>That's great.</i>

401
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,260
<i>You should think about</i>

402
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,830
<i>your personal issues.</i>

403
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,460
<i>By the way,</i>

404
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,510
<i>we found you a housemate.</i>

405
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,750
<i>It's my friend's child.</i>

406
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,830
<i>I hope
you can get along with each other.</i>

407
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,220
How are you?

408
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,790
I'll visit you one day.

409
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,750
Can you share the table?

410
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,230
I have no choice.

411
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,070
Don't worry about me.

412
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,710
I never hear anything.

413
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,550
I don't know.

414
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,270
He can share the table.

415
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,590
I don't know.

416
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,910
Thank you.

417
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,470
Can I take your order?

418
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,950
Let me have a look.

419
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,270
Talk to you later.

420
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,630
Goodbye.

421
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,110
Don't pretend.

422
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,620
If you want to apologise,
wait till I'm done.

423
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,590
Apologise?

424
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,830
Are you apologising to me?

425
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,750
Were you punished?

426
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,190
Are you upset?

427
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,510
It's fine.

428
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,470
Men grow up in blows.

429
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
I don't want to share the table.

430
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,630
You can leave.

431
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,710
This is my table.

432
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,270
Then leave with your table.

433
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,470
Are you ready to order?

434
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,580
-Yes.
-Okra.

435
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,550
Chicken.

436
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,550
Tofu.

437
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,900
Salted egg yolk bun.

438
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,710
Okay.

439
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,540
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,740
We have one bun left.

441
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,230
He ordered it first.

442
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,950
Put it here.

443
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,420
What's wrong?

444
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,260
What's wrong?

445
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,940
It's my boyfriend.

446
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,990
My boyfriend choked on the beef.

447
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,870
Put him over the back of the chair.

448
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,380
No.

449
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,380
Punch him.

450
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,340
A hollow punch.

451
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:24,950
Punch where?

452
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,910
In the stomach.

453
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,870
How are you?

454
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,870
Thank you.

455
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,150
It feels good.

456
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,389
What a poor kitten.

457
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,070
Why are you here?

458
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,909
Were you abandoned?

459
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,949
Do you want me to bring you home?

460
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,230
<i>Bring me home, miss.</i>

461
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,350
I don't have my own place.

462
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,750
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,429
Goodbye.

464
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,110
I don't care.

465
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,230
Let's take a bath.

466
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:00,540
It's very cute, for real.

467
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,710
<i>No, it's not.</i>

468
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,460
<i>Do you know how many parasites</i>

469
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,430
<i>a cat has?</i>

470
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,270
I have de-wormed it.

471
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,070
No.

472
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,030
That house was lent to you

473
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,190
by Mu Min.

474
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,340
I know, I know.

475
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,590
I'll be very careful.

476
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,990
I remember locking it.

477
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,670
<i>What did you say?</i>

478
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,830
I'll talk to you later, Mum.

479
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,750
Xia Chu.

480
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,190
<i>Oh my, what a handsome man.</i>

481
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,150
It's you.

482
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,310
Why are you here?

483
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,180
This is my house.

484
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,270
Are you Mu Min's son?

485
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,350
Yes.

486
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,420
Didn't you say

487
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,100
the house was vacant?

488
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,140
Liang Mu Ze appeared

489
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,590
when I moved in.

490
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,710
<i>Isn't that normal?</i>

491
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,870
<i>He is the actual owner.</i>

492
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,550
If you aren't willing,

493
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,950
you can move out.

494
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,340
<i>Move again?</i>

495
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,870
<i>I just moved in.</i>

496
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,270
I've moved multiple times

497
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,870
since I graduated.

498
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,420
Xia Chu is a girl.

499
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,340
Of course,

500
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,310
she's a girl.

501
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,870
Didn't I tell you?

502
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,910
You said he's a guy.

503
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,460
<i>When did I tell you he's a guy?</i>

504
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,140
<i>I don't care.</i>

505
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,270
<i>She already stopped
renting her old place.</i>

506
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,540
<i>Furthermore,</i>

507
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,870
<i>do you want to see her
live on the street?</i>

508
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,950
They have a hostel in the hospital.

509
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,910
The application time is already over.

510
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,710
Or

511
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,150
you can come home.

512
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,940
You can be a doctor here.

513
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,270
Why would you go to such a faraway place?

514
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,630
You should know.

515
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,660
When I married your dad,

516
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,110
her mum came to help me

517
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,230
in Dong'an.

518
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,710
What does it have to do with me?

519
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,940
You can take care

520
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,470
of each other.

521
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,750
It's a complicated society outside.

522
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,220
<i>You have two choices.</i>

523
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,980
<i>You can choose to stay,</i>

524
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,180
<i>or you can come back to Dong'an.</i>

525
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,550
<i>It's no use.</i>

526
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,740
When I bought the house,

527
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,510
I wanted you to get married soon.

528
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,030
I heard

529
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,350
her son

530
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,750
is an officer.

531
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,270
How does she look like?

532
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,350
Is she pretty?

533
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,950
What are you thinking, Mum?

534
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,750
What do you think?

535
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,390
Or...

536
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,670
<i>I can get your grandfather
to inquire about him</i>

537
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,470
<i>in his unit.</i>

538
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,380
Miss Lan.

539
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,110
Don't create problems for me.

540
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,740
It's my problem.

541
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,670
I can solve it myself.

542
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,380
Do you want some noodles?

543
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,550
Yes, I do.

544
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,990
You forgot to add salt.

545
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,950
I did add it. A little bit.

546
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,740
Too much salt is not healthy.

547
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,830
Not more than 5g per person every day.

548
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,190
Xia Chu.

549
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,230
I must talk to you.

550
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,430
Wait until I'm done.

551
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,230
This is my lunch.

552
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,590
I'm going to the hospital.

553
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,070
What do you want to discuss?

554
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,830
First of all, which room do you stay in?

555
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,270
This one.

556
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,670
Are you sure?

557
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,270
Mu Min told me I can use

558
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,310
the bathroom in the master bedroom.

559
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,180
So, when you are not home,

560
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,150
occasionally,

561
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,260
only once in a while,

562
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,940
I can use your bathtub.

563
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,070
Secondly.

564
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,540
What's this?

565
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,150
<i>Don't be so rough.</i>

566
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,550
<i>You are hurting me.</i>

567
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,500
Don't hold it this way.

568
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,820
It'll be scared.

569
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,590
It's a cat that I picked up.

570
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,670
You can keep the cat,

571
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,700
but I don't want to see

572
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,180
any faeces in the room.

573
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,470
No fur and no smell.

574
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,700
Don't worry,

575
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,100
cats are cleaner than humans.

576
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,390
Thirdly,

577
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,190
you can use my bathroom.

578
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,630
But you must pack things up.

579
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,190
Is this yours?

580
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,820
My memory padded bra.

581
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,310
I thought I lost it.

582
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,430
Where was it?

583
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,830
In my dryer.

584
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,590
It's so dirty.

585
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,990
Okay.

586
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,150
Lastly, number four, which is also

587
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,740
the most important.

588
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,710
Listen clearly.

589
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,790
Move out from here

590
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,310
in one week time.

591
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,710
What?

592
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,790
Move out.

593
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,500
You ate my noodles just now.

594
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,460
Have you forgotten?

595
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,030
I remember. It wasn't tasty.

596
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,950
Do you really want me to move out?

597
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,580
Why did you

598
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,140
talk so much just now?

599
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,670
Just go straight to the fourth point.

600
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,460
To see

601
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,670
your shocking look.

602
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,310
It feels good.

603
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,470
I can pay the rent.

604
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,670
I don't need money.

605
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,990
Liang Mu Ze.

606
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,940
If you can't afford one,

607
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,910
tell me.

608
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,950
I'll find you a moving company.

609
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,070
Liang Mu Ze.
