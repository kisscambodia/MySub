00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,330
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,610
Old Master.

5
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,530
It's been a while, Zhuo Ran.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,860
Old Master.

7
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,260
[How is it going with the company?]

8
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,020
Everything is going well.

9
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,110
But I've heard that

10
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,060
there has been a little trouble
with this task.

11
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,640
[It's just a bit tortuous, that's all.]

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,850
Tortuous?

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,470
This doesn't sound like your
usual way of doing things.

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,430
[Old Master,]

15
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,250
I have flexible ways to get things done,

16
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,750
it depends on the target.

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,950
[Approaching the target's daughter,
I get it.]

18
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,230
But why mess with the army?

19
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,890
In order to remove all obstacles,

20
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,450
to hold the

21
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,220
daughter card in our hands.

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,420
Isn't that what you sent me to China for?

23
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,080
So

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,290
you are acting in the
interest of the company,

25
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,290
is that right?

26
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,460
[Of course.]

27
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,850
[There's nothing personal here.]

28
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,610
Good.

29
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,770
Trusting you is a right decision.

30
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,800
[Thank you for your trust, Old Master.]

31
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,450
Zhuo Ran,

32
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,730
[your mother hasn't been]

33
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,760
[in the best of health lately.]

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,279
Can I talk to her for a minute?

35
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,570
[She's resting.]

36
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,920
The doctor said

37
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,810
her blood vessels that
have been bypassed before

38
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,000
are blocked again.

39
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,940
Looks like the medicine isn't working.

40
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,610
[She needs a heart transplant.]

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,660
You should finish the task
as soon as possible

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,040
so that you can come back early.

43
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,980
[Without her son around,]

44
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,420
[how am I supposed to arrange]

45
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,270
such a major operation
for her, am I right?

46
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,470
[I got it.]

47
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,040
Okay, that's all.

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,750
I'll be waiting for the good news.

49
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,670
Old Master,

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,910
he is lying.

51
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,010
He didn't approach the military major

52
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,590
simply to complete the task
you assigned him.

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,880
Long Yi,

54
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,830
do you know the tips of flying a kite?

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,870
The wind direction, wind
force, running speed

56
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,920
and the timing to pull the string,

57
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,310
if you can get these things right,

58
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:23,760
the kite

59
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,990
will fly high and far.

60
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,110
However,

61
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,390
no matter how high or how far it flies,

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,070
as long as the string is still in my hand,

63
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,240
it will never fly away.

64
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,109
Old Master,

65
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm going back to China tomorrow then.

66
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,200
Do one more thing for me before you leave.

67
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,109
Okay.

68
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,670
Get rid of Gui.

69
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,690
He approached my client
without permission.

70
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,570
I'm afraid he's getting greedy.

71
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,760
Got it.

72
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,550
Thanks.

73
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,240
Don't mention it.

74
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,310
If you really want to read that book,

75
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,440
I can buy you another one online.

76
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,590
Never mind, I'll go back and look again.

77
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,490
Okay.

78
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,680
Have you met with Mi Gu lately?

79
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,640
Lately?

80
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,790
We met once after we came
back from the flood relief mission.

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,560
What's the matter?

82
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,690
You want to talk to her?

83
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,190
No, I'm just asking.

84
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,850
Mr Zhang asked you

85
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,040
to find out about this for him, didn't he?

86
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,230
No.

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,270
It's very obvious that Mr Zhang

88
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,650
has a thing for Mi Gu.

89
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,330
I just didn't expect

90
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,280
you would do such

91
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,960
meddlesome thing.

92
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,600
Once again, you're out of
character, Captain Liang.

93
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,780
Bye.

94
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,510
[Outpatient Department]

95
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,590
[Liang Mu Ze, come to the
flower shop now, it's an emergency.]

96
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,210
The most crucial first
step in floral arrangement

97
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,230
is to choose the right colour scheme,

98
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,870
avoid using too many different colours.

99
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,090
For example,

100
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,750
these three colours I use seem more...

101
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,780
Avoid using too many different colours.

102
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,870
For example,

103
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,850
choose the colours based
on the age and personality

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,000
of the person you are
giving the flower basket to.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,100
When I chose this gladiolus,

106
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,040
we should trim its roots.

107
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,970
What brings you here?

108
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,190
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,800
Xiao Jun's little girlfriend

110
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,270
sent him a postcard,

111
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,520
I came here to give it to him.

112
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,470
Since I'm here, I stayed to
learn about floral arrangement,

113
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,990
cultivate my taste.

114
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,480
Meng Zhen, where's Xiao Jun?

115
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,490
He's upstairs, go and see him.

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,750
I'll be upstairs then.

117
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,200
Enjoy your class.

118
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,360
To make it absorb more water,

119
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,870
I cut it diagonally.

120
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,430
Xiao Jun.

121
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,560
Liang Mu Ze, you're finally here.

122
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,720
Hurry up, show me the moves

123
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,160
of the military boxing skill again.

124
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,690
Now.

125
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,350
What's the matter? Who
picked on you again?

126
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,230
No one, it's for Xuan Xuan.

127
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,440
A month ago,

128
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,430
she sent a postcard to the hospital.

129
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,370
But by the time it arrived,

130
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,720
I was already discharged.

131
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,640
Dr Zhang just gave it to me today.

132
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,910
She mentioned in her postcard that

133
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,200
she wanted to see me

134
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,280
do the military boxing
skill on her birthday.

135
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,609
but I can't remember some of the moves.

136
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,800
This is the emergency?

137
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,010
-This is very important to me, okay?
-Okay.

138
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Xiao Jun!

139
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,490
What's the matter?

140
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,840
Nothing.

141
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,880
Mu Ze, would you like to stay for dinner?

142
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,070
Sure.

143
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,170
Xiao Jun,

144
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,830
stop pestering Mu Ze all the time.

145
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,600
He just came back, he's tired.

146
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,530
Give him a break.

147
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,530
It's okay. Let me hang
with him for a while.

148
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,720
Okay.

149
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,160
Have you done your homework?

150
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,210
Just a little bit left.

151
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,360
Finish your homework first.

152
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,330
Yes, Sir!

153
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,550
You need to do

154
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,930
this.

155
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,110
Yes, Sir!

156
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,520
Why are you here alone?

157
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,390
Meng Zhen went food shopping.

158
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,989
She's making you a welcome-back dinner.

159
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,150
Look.

160
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,759
That's me right there.

161
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,530
Looking good, right?

162
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,390
I looked sharp in military uniform.

163
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,790
Does he work for your hospital?

164
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,010
No.

165
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,890
Their company

166
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,440
has set up a fund in our hospital

167
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,920
called Public Interest Research Fund.

168
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,050
That day,

169
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,050
Xia Chu's friend said she
wanted to interview me,

170
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,210
so I took her to record some footage.

171
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,880
I didn't expect that
she actually aired them.

172
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,550
Xia Chu's friend? Mi Gu?

173
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,790
Yes.

174
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,080
Director Mi said

175
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,270
in her next show, she is planning to

176
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,990
interview urban independent bookshops.

177
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,200
I think I should recommend
Meng Zhen's shop

178
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,370
to her.

179
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,680
It'll be good publicity for her shop.

180
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,130
Who? What did you call her?

181
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,320
Meng Zhen.

182
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,840
Chen Meng Zhen.

183
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,950
Nice, right?

184
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,830
Not only is her name nice,

185
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,590
she's very beautiful too.

186
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,010
And she's elegant.

187
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,760
Not only does she know how to enjoy life,

188
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,000
she also has great business mind.

189
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,680
Look how well she manages her small shop.

190
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,370
Whoever gets to marry her

191
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,230
will be a very lucky man.

192
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,320
Dr Zhang, do you come here often?

193
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,510
No, this is my first time.

194
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,130
I will come here more often from now on.

195
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,310
Don't come here again.

196
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,710
Don't hit on her.

197
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm not hitting on her.

198
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,190
If you are making a mistake,
you must correct it.

199
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,390
Wait, correct what?

200
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,490
I'm an unmarried man

201
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,510
who admires a single woman.

202
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,350
There's nothing wrong with that.

203
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,960
Meng Zhen is different.

204
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,120
Besides, I know fully well what
you are into, Dr Zhang.

205
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,470
You can admire Meng Zhen,
just don't hit on her.

206
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,270
If she and Xiao Jun

207
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,920
are hurt because of you,

208
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,230
I won't let you off.

209
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,610
Let me ask you a question.

210
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,960
What's your relationship with her?

211
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,120
With Meng Zhen? She's the
widow of my fallen comrade.

212
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,960
I know she's the widow
of your fallen comrade.

213
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,110
So she's not your lover, is she?

214
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,320
In any case,

215
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,080
even if I'm interested
in Chen Meng Zhen...

216
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,390
Meng Zhen, you're back!

217
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,450
I forgot my phone.

218
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,850
Don't mind me.

219
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,110
You guys carry on.

220
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,750
I'll be back soon.

221
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,450
-Dinner will be ready when I get back.
-Okay.

222
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,770
-Take your time.
-Okay.

223
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,230
Don't buy too much food.

224
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,890
She's so nice.

225
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,840
Go back. Are you
really going to stay for dinner?

226
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,560
Shouldn't I leave after dinner?

227
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,270
No dinner for you, just go.

228
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,770
Honestly, I was just joking.

229
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,950
Did you fall for it?

230
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,560
Fine, I'll leave.

231
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,810
I can see that if I really stay,

232
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,190
you're going to lose your appetite.

233
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,030
All right now, just go.

234
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,820
Doesn't your hospital have a

235
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,490
toxicology and pharmacology laboratory?

236
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,310
Yes, the best in the city. Why?

237
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,350
Examine this bottle of pills for me.

238
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,160
Is this an official task
or a private favour?

239
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,840
A tough ask. Just go already.

240
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,640
Fine, leave it to me.

241
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,640
How are the patients?

242
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,410
Mr Zhang, what are you doing here?

243
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,920
Isn't today your off day?

244
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,560
I'm running an errand for a friend.

245
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm just dropping by to

246
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,320
bring you girls

247
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,650
some food.

248
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,840
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

249
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,610
Most of the patients are doing fine,

250
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,570
except for one patient

251
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,390
who just had a heart surgery.

252
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,600
After he woke up,

253
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,810
his emotions became
unusually sensitive and fragile.

254
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,240
According to his wife's description,

255
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,230
he has become a totally different person.

256
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,050
His personality changed?

257
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,690
I looked into the heart donor.

258
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,000
He was a young man in his twenties,

259
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,070
who loved to read and write poetry.

260
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,210
When he was recuperating,

261
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,070
he even composed nearly 100 song lyrics.

262
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,700
You are saying that

263
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,510
his personality changed

264
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,880
because he has someone else's
heart in his body now?

265
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,640
I was just thinking that

266
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,740
since the heart delivers
blood to the whole body,

267
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,510
including the brain,

268
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,310
is it possible that

269
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,330
when some of the donor's stem cells

270
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,850
reach the brain,

271
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,720
it has affected the memory
function of the recipient,

272
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,720
and that this could
be a sign of rejection?

273
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,560
I think you are overthinking this.

274
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,750
It's actually a
psychological implication.

275
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,010
Think about it,

276
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,350
a man who has been suffered
from heart disease for over 20 years,

277
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,690
had a narrow escape from death.

278
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,600
He has received a second chance to live,

279
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,450
it's completely normal that

280
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,760
his personality has changed dramatically.

281
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,730
Besides, he also knew that his donor

282
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,770
was a young man in his twenties.

283
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,550
And unconsciously,

284
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,430
it could affect him
psychologically too, right?

285
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,360
It's hard to tell about such stuff.

286
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,650
There's one thing I've
always been curious about.

287
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,330
You see,

288
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,310
about the Chinese characters
invented by our ancestors,

289
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,530
the one word that associates
with emotions and feelings,

290
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,170
is 'heart'.

291
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,470
You see,

292
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,960
when one sees a pretty
woman, his heart flutters.

293
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,430
When one falls in love,
he finds his heart's desire.

294
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,150
When one has a breakup, his heart breaks.

295
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,540
Am I right?

296
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,160
Could there be something that

297
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,760
cannot be explained medically in this?

298
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,000
How about this?

299
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,970
Go talk to the doctors
in psychiatry department,

300
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,270
they may have better advice.

301
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,170
Okay, I'll go now.

302
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,920
Dr Zhang,

303
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,960
there's something wrong
with those pills you gave me.

304
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,670
[Hang in there, Liang Mu Ze.]

305
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,910
Go now.

306
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,510
What's wrong with them?

307
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,630
The compound of
these pills are a bit odd.

308
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,910
Where did you get it from?

309
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,550
Don't bother with where did I get it from.

310
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,080
You just need to tell me

311
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,550
if it's toxic or not.

312
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,050
Fine.

313
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,010
I'll let you know when
the results are out.

314
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,360
-Be quick.
-Okay.

315
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,330
-And don't tell anyone else.
-Okay.

316
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,520
Mr Zhang.

317
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,920
What are you doing back here?

318
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,950
Did you get that bottle of pills just now

319
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,450
from Liang Mu Ze?

320
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,440
He told you too?

321
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,110
He's such a big mouth.

322
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,140
He even asked me to keep it a secret.

323
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,680
Why did he want to examine it?

324
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,470
Why do you care

325
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,080
about his affairs?

326
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

327
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,130
[Outpatient Department]

328
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,930
Get in the car.

329
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,040
Did you eat the bottle
of pills I gave you?

330
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,230
I did.

331
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,720
Is there a problem?

332
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,070
No.

333
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,750
Then why did you ask Mr Zhang
to find someone to examine it for you?

334
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,250
Zhang Yi Chi told you?

335
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,560
I saw it myself.

336
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,840
What exactly are you
thinking about, Liang Mu Ze?

337
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,600
Did you think I gave you fake drug?

338
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,710
No.

339
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,390
This has nothing to do with you.

340
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,830
Who does this have to do with then?

341
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,210
-Get in the car first.
-Why exactly?

342
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,670
You have to give me an explanation.

343
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,730
Otherwise, I will think

344
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,600
my good intention has been misunderstood.

345
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,590
I'll explain it after
the results are out.

346
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,640
Fine then.

347
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll see you when the results are out.

348
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,830
Rao Zhi, okay, I'll be right there.

349
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,280
Uncle Rao.

350
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,520
I hope I didn't disturb you.

351
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,000
You didn't.

352
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,280
What are you doing here?

353
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,590
I once made a promise to your aunt.

354
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,270
No matter how busy I am,

355
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,990
I must take one day per week

356
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,180
to spend time with her and our daughter.

357
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,440
In the past,

358
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,240
we visited this park often.

359
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,680
They would feed the pigeons

360
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,400
and I would doze off on this bench,

361
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,750
occasionally woken by their laughter,

362
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,029
watching them running around.

363
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,430
At that time,

364
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,309
I felt that no matter how hard
and exhausting my works were,

365
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,200
it was worth it.

366
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,470
Xue is coming back home.

367
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:30,760
She didn't listen to me.

368
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:33,840
She only informed me
after she booked the flight.

369
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,480
But Mu Ze,

370
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,870
I can't see her.

371
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,240
I understand.

372
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,690
Send me her flight number,

373
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,110
leave the rest to me.

374
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,990
Thanks.

375
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,510
By the way,

376
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,140
you said you suspected someone

377
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,360
had broken into your house.

378
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,610
I've gotten someone
to pull the CCTV footage

379
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,800
from the streets around.

380
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,350
There are a lot of footage.

381
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,750
It might take some time.

382
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,470
It's okay, no hurry.

383
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,510
I've installed CCTV in my home.

384
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,710
If anything happens,
I'll be the first to find out.

385
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,650
After that,

386
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,520
is there anything else unusual happen?

387
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,720
Someone switched my usual medication.

388
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,700
Who did it?

389
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,710
I'm getting the ingredients
of the medicine checked.

390
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,980
I will contact you if there is a problem.

391
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,340
Uncle Rao,

392
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,430
have you ever thought that

393
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,520
if you let Xue and Aunt

394
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,350
see you at work,

395
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,020
all misunderstandings would be cleared?

396
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,820
I've always thought that

397
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,710
the elimination of crime is not
really about anything else,

398
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,150
it's to protect their smiles.

399
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,040
But sometimes there is more evil

400
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,470
in the world than we can imagine.

401
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,630
Honestly,

402
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,390
I don't dare to risk it.

403
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,760
I'd rather keep them far away.

404
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,360
Old Master, we have a problem.

405
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,930
Several of our processing plants
outside the country have been robbed.

406
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,050
All the goods are gone.

407
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,960
Who did it?

408
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,970
Gui.

409
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,040
You sure?

410
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,010
Without doubt.

411
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,750
And I just got word that

412
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,190
he's on a boat to China.

413
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,760
Notify Zhuo Ran.

414
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes.

415
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,360
Who is this?

416
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,830
Mi Gu.

417
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,390
What's the matter with you?
Why do you look so nervous?

418
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,720
The lift pervert is back.

419
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,710
He almost got into my place today.

420
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,750
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

421
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,760
Running into such a pervert,

422
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,170
why are you so unlucky?

423
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,480
It's all because...

424
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,560
Because of what?

425
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,080
Because I've been down on my luck.

426
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,280
Have you had dinner?

427
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,880
I'm so mad that I've lost my appetite.

428
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,910
Has that annoying colleague

429
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,290
of yours set you up again?

430
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,920
It's that braised egg, Liang Mu Ze.

431
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,890
He actually took the medicine

432
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,470
I gave him to our hospital for testing.

433
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,730
What is he thinking about?

434
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,650
Did he seriously think that

435
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,210
I would take advantage of

436
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,760
my own profession to poison his drug?

437
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,310
Am I that wicked to him?

438
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,270
Xia Chu.

439
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,840
I've made up my mind.

440
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,480
This time, I'm really going to move out.

441
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,800
I don't want to share a place

442
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,040
with a man who has such
evil thoughts anymore.

443
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,050
What if he did find out something?

444
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,320
What can he find out?

445
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,130
I gave him that drug personally.

446
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,320
It's impossible that there's
something wrong with it.

447
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,110
I switched the pills.

448
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,920
What do you mean by that?

449
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,080
The day I went to pick up Er Miao,

450
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,160
I replaced the bottle of pills

451
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,720
with tranquillizers.

452
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,560
You...

453
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,200
Why?

454
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,640
Because of Zhuo Ran.

455
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,360
He was really worried about you.

456
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,950
Xia Chu isn't doing good.

457
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,080
When I had a meal
with her the other day,

458
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,480
I noticed that she was very tense

459
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,720
and stressed.

460
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,560
It can't be.

461
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,490
I just had a video chat with her,

462
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,390
she seemed fine.

463
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,570
She even told me that
she was going to join

464
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,720
the frontline of flood relief
with her medical team.

465
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,320
She has been avoiding me.

466
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,000
My return this time

467
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,160
seems to have made her feel distressed.

468
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,510
You want me to talk to her?

469
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,690
What is this?

470
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,880
Tranquillizer.

471
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,770
Xia Chu has

472
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,840
a history of sleeping pill addiction.

473
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,310
It's a bad habit

474
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,720
she picked up after I left.

475
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,750
I knew that.

476
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,030
But she hasn't had
insomnia for a long time.

477
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,790
But I'm still worried.

478
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,550
I'm afraid that she would relapse.

479
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,250
You've been keeping an eye on her?

480
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,430
Yes.

481
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,870
What do you want me to do?

482
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,960
Find a chance to go
through her backpack.

483
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,920
If you find those pills,

484
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,190
replace them with this.

485
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,690
Its dose is very small,

486
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,050
equivalent to a placebo.

487
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,070
It won't affect her much if she eats it.

488
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,350
You and I both want her to be well,

489
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,670
right?

490
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,170
I really thought that
bottle of pills were yours.

491
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,360
Are you guys close?

492
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,090
If you aren't close,

493
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,600
things like switching my pills,

494
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,230
why would he come to you?

495
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,730
Because he knows we are good friends.

496
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,400
Last time when he suddenly fell ill,

497
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,150
you were the one who
took him to the hospital.

498
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,240
We were talking about work that time.

499
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,640
Mi Gu,

500
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,750
I want the truth.

501
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,640
Xia Chu,

502
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,360
do you remember the man at the airport

503
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,010
I told you about,

504
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,680
the one I fell in love
with at first sight?

505
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,920
I used the same suitcase as him.

506
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,620
He was staying at the
hotel opposite my house.

507
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
His window was just opposite my house.

508
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,710
A French window.

509
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,030
I thought

510
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,870
I was meant to be with him.

511
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,550
Until you told me that

512
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,070
he was Zhuo Ran.

513
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,400
I didn't tell you before

514
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,880
because I thought

515
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,350
I could let go.

516
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,720
I didn't want to make things complicated.

517
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,440
Then why are you telling me now?

518
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,960
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,880
[It's me.]

520
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,230
Xia Chu just came by.

521
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,920
She learned

522
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,010
about the pills.

523
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,320
[Liang Mu Ze is now having
the drug examined.]

524
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,880
It's fine.

525
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,400
Those pills I gave you,

526
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,520
even if they're tested,

527
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,190
they won't find anything wrong in it.

528
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm not worried about the pills.

529
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm worried about our relationship.

530
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,790
[Us.]

531
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,510
[Xia Chu and I.]

532
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,040
[You and I.]

533
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,000
[Gui betrayed us, get rid of him.]

534
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,670
[Copy that.]

535
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,750
[Zhuo Ran, are you there?]

536
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,080
I really don't want to lose Xia Chu.

537
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,480
And I don't want to miss out on you.

538
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,830
Missing out on me

539
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,390
might actually be a blessing to you.

540
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,760
Whether it's good luck or bad luck,

541
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,350
I just want my own choice.

542
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,870
[I only trust my own judgment.]

543
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,030
You can reject me,

544
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,030
but don't try to change my mind.

545
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,990
[Xia Chu,]

546
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,880
[it was Zhuo Ran who
asked me to switch the pills.]

547
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,970
[Hello, everyone. I'm Zhuo Ran.]

548
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,910
[Z-h-u-o, R-a-n.]

549
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,630
Hello, Xia Chu.

550
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,360
Zhuo Ran?

551
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,560
It's me.

552
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,150
Xia Chu,

553
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,540
I'm back.

554
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,400
Have you met with Mi Gu lately?

555
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,600

557
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,350
Why?

558
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,670
Because of Zhuo Ran.

559
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,160
He's really worried about you.

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,840
I've found a place.

570
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,360

575
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,700
Sorry for the trouble I've
caused you during this period.

576
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,240
Thank you.

577
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,910
If you are leaving,
take all those things you bought with you.

578
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,880
[They are too big for me to take away,
I'll give it to you.]

579
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,630
[I don't want those junk.]

580
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,370
[What junk?]

581
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,650
[I hand-picked those stuff]

582
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,080
and I paired them carefully.

583
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,790
And you are just going to leave them here?

584
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,840
Just abandon them here?

585
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,070
Have you ever thought about my...

586
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,470
Thought about what?

587
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,430
Have you even thought
about these junks' feelings?

588
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,690
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

589
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,030
Wait.

590
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,750
Let me show you something.

591
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,960
This...

592
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,080
You installed a surveillance in the house?

593
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,720
[You spied on me?]

594
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,150
[I have no interest in your privacy.]

595
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,600
I installed surveillance to
keep an eye on my house,

596
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,480
to protect you.

597
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,830
This isn't spying.

598
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,920
And it just happened to record

599
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,750
what you friend did.

600
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,960
She did it for a reason.

601
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,410
The pills she switched aren't harmful

602
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,850
to the body of the person taking them.

603
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,130
No matter her reason,

604
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,370
no matter what her purpose is,

605
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,150
I found that my pills had been switched,

606
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,660
so I took it for a test.

607
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,980
Nothing wrong with that, right?

608
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,230
No.

609
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,190
Why are you still leaving then?

610
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,710
Get out of the way!

611
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,710
Let go!

612
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,800
Let go!

613
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,490
Stop it, Xia Chu.

614
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,930
Let go! I'm not mad at you!

615
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,010
Who are you mad at then?

616
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,040
I don't want to say.

617
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,090
Then you are mad at me.

618
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,520
No, I'm not mad at you, really!

619
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,430
I just had too much going on today.

620
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,770
First, I found that you took
the drug I gave you for testing,

621
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,130
and I was furious.

622
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,920
I went to see Mi Gu.

623
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,680
I just wanted to complain to her,

624
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,110
I didn't expect that she would tell me...

625
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,080
Forget it, that's not important.

626
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,930
Everything just came together.

627
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,200
I'm in over my head.

628
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,120
I don't know how to digest it.

629
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,600
I need time.

630
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,970
I need space to calm myself down.

631
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,170
I need to get my mind straight.

632
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,430
At least right now, I don't
want to see you, Liang Mu Ze.

633
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,660
No.

634
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,270
Get out of my way!

635
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,860
If you don't want to see me, it's fine.

636
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,020
I can leave,

637
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,050
but you can't.

638
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,400
Not to mention that it's night now.

639
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,560
What do you care?

640
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,160
I don't.

641
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,030
I need you.

642
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,390
My cousin is returning
home at the end of the month.

643
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,670
That's your business.

644
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,120
I've sent you her flight number.

645
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,090
Pick her up for me.

646
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,970
Why should I?

647
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,970
She will stay here too.

648
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,290

649
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,480
get along with each other.

650
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,930
She will be living here,

651
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,120
but I won't.

652
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,550
Help me out, Xia Chu.

653
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,000
Please?

654
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,050
I really have to leave now.

655
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,010
Call me if you need anything,

656
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,560
but I might not be able to answer it.

657
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,200
I haven't agreed to it yet!

658
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,330
There is another thing I need to tell you.

659
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,520
I don't want to hear it.

660
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,680
Fine, tell me, hurry up.

661
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,120

Liang Shao Xue,

00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,080
she has adult ADHD.

664
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,000
She has difficulty in concentrating

665
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,250
and controlling her emotions.

666
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,890
She also has intermittent depression.

667
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,890
She can pass out at any time.

668
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,920
What?

669
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,800
So when you pick her up,

670
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,050
make sure you pay
attention to her condition.

671
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,480
Be careful and more careful, okay?

672
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,890
You know she is sick

673
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,190
and you are still asking
me to pick her up?

674
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,090
Well, you are a doctor.

675
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,570
I am a cardiothoracic surgeon!

676
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,360
That's still a doctor.

677
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,030
Besides, other than you,

678
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,720
I don't trust other people.

679
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,830
So it can only be you, Xia Chu.

680
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,350
Stop flattering me.

681
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,520
All right now.

you some candy when I get back.

689

I want to eat some too.

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,380
Long Yi.

739
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,090
Please.

740
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,440
You deserve to die.

741
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,780
Nice shot.

742
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,220
Looks like you really hate him.

743
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,020
Even his head is blown off.

744
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,020
I found Gui.

745
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,660
Where is he?

746
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,780
The ID of Zhou Lan, which
we have been monitoring,

747
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,990
was found to have been logged in

748
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,240
by someone else at Xiong's company.

749
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,830
After that,

750
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,070
he engaged with someone
with the ID, Buddha

751
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,710
on City of Desire.

752
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,670
They agreed to pick up the goods

753
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,790
at Wenhui Hotel

754
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,460
at 3 p.m. the day after tomorrow.

755
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,340
As for the identity of the other party,

756
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,420
it is not yet clear.

757
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,400
Keep an eye on this Xiong person.

758
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,580
Yes, Sir!

759
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,150
So this is Gui?

760
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,270
As the founder of the platform,

761
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,750
I have a way of finding out every ID

762
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,850
that appears on the platform.

763
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,420
By the way,

764
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,350
a medical forum will be held

765
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,380
at Wenhui Hotel two days later.

766
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,470
The security measures will definitely

767
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,540
be much tighter than usual.

768
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,390
Yet he chose to hand
out the goods at that place.

769
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,700
Why would he want to do that?

770
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,900
Xia Guang Yuan?

771
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,200
Since Gui wants to
replace Old Master so badly,

772
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,180
he won't let go of this opportunity.

773
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,430
Are you saying that Xia Guang Yuan

774
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,130
is his real target?

775
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,340
Gui

776
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,500
is too greedy.

777
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,340
Where are you going?

778
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,160
The hotel.

779
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,530
Gui, I've confirmed it.

780
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,360
Xia Guang Yuan will attend
the event as scheduled.

781
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,550
Good.

782
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,670
What about the deal
with Xiong the day after?

783
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,960
I'll go personally. Leave it to me, Gui.

784
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,090
Finally, I'm going to meet Xia Guang Yuan.

785
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,240
Are you home?

786
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,230
[I am.]

787
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,410
[What's the matter?]

788
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,220
Draw the curtains.

789
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,140
Open the window too.

790
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,180
Do you see me?

791
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,740
I do.

792
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,810
What are you doing up there?

793
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,060
I am watching you.

794
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,770
It's windy.

795
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,340
It's nothing.

796
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,460
Do you have any plans two days later?

797
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,130
I have work to do that day.

798
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,890
Are you going to cover the medical forum?

799
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,650
How did you know that?

800
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,850
[I always have a way of finding out about]

801
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,420
[the people and things that interest me.]

802
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,620
I would like to ask
you for a favour, Mi Gu.

803
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,090
Go on.

804
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,090
The test results are out.

805
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,740
[How is it? Is it poisonous?]

806
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,860
I can't exactly say it's poisonous,

807
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,110
but it's not completely safe either.

808
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,300
What do you mean?

809
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,500
Do you know about its characteristics?

810
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,100
[It dissolves very easily in water.]

811
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,230
That's right.

812
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,350
The inside of the pill is porous,

813
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,040
it dissolve easily in water,

814
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,590
making it easy for
the patient to swallow.

815
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,730
This is the key feature
of 3D-printed drug.

816
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,600
3D-printed drug? Are you sure?

817
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,910
[It can't be wrong.]

818
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,630
[Our department is also
working on developing this.]

819
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,590
The main ingredient of the drug

820
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,870
is a combination of several herbs

821
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,710
that have a calming and sedative effect,

822
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,940
synthesized by 3D printing technology.

823
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,680
[Most importantly,]

824
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,620
[it is overdosed with an adjuvant]

825
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,450
[called aristolochia debilis.]

826
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,760
Long-term use of this drug

827
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,340
comes with the risk of liver cancer.

828
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,050
[What are you going to do with this drug?]

829
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,060
[For an assassination mission?]

830
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,300
Put the drug away.

831
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,140
I'll come and get it from you.
