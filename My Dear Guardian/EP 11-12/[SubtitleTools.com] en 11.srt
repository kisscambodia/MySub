Captain.

00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,560
Captain Liang!

6
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,090
What are you doing here? Leave now!

7
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,410
I'm here to deliver the medicine
and to give you a checkup.

8
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,610
I'm alright. Leave now!

9
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,960
How can you be alright?

10
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,080
Xiao Teng said you haven't slept
for days.

11
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,210
I'm reminding you as a doctor.

12
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,720
You must take a break now!

13
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,040
No need to!

14
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,120
Just take a break for a few minutes.

15
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,080
Send her away.

16
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,400
Unless you take a break,
I'm not going anywhere.

17
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,200
Captain, why don't you listen to Dr Xia?

18
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,800
So you're aware that
I'm your captain?

19
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,250
Send her away!

20
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,800
Listen, Liang Mu Ze.

21
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,090
You should carry out the mission

22
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,410
on the premise that
you take care of yourself.

23
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,160
You're made of blood and flesh!

I'm an occupational military officer.

25
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,650
I know my own body's condition.

26

Send her away!

27
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,330
Yes!

28
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,670
Don't touch me! Liang Mu Ze!

Cool down.

50
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,950
Thank you, Brigade Commander Dong.

51
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:49,670
He's not gentle at all.

52
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,640
You need to reflect upon yourself

53
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,520
for what has happened today.

54
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,560
As long as she stays away from the dyke,

55
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,830
I'll reflect upon myself on anything.

56
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,150
If I don't go to the dyke,
will you take a break?

57
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,650
Is it the right time for a break?

58
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,470
-As I said, your safety...
-Enough!

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,050
How are things going on on your side?

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,200
No doubt the water level

61
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,930
at the ten mission areas have reduced

62
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,040
but the water level at three other areas

63
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,120
are still above the warning line.

64
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,550
Mission area number two
is the most dangerous one.

65
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,290
What happened?

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,630
Don't move. Let me check on him.

67
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,600
He came down with a fever.

68
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,590

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,400
Brigade Commander,
the three patients who caught a cold

74
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,359
came down with fevers
higher than 39 degrees Celsius.

75
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,670
They have sore throats,
stuffy noses and body aches.

76
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,910
They also suffer from
coughing and diarrhoea.

77
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,480
Report.

78
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,450
I need to use the outhouse.

79
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,690
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

80
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,070
-Bring him to the outhouse.
-Yes.

81
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,630
Brigade Commander, I must not die.

82
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,590
I'm the only son in the family.

83
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,150
He is still waiting to hand over
the family business to me.

84
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,350
Cut the nonsense.

85
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,720
Stay in bed.

86
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes.

87
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,320
Can't you confirm the diagnosis by now?

88
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,600
With the equipment that we have,

89
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,570
I can't confirm the diagnosis.

90
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,290
You can report it to the superior
since there are three patients.

91
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,250
It's four.

92
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,840
We have to include the staff officer
who has just passed out.

-What's wrong, Xiao Teng?
-I'm having a stomachache.

94

Don't go near him.

95
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,560
Stay back.

besides Dr Wu and me,

103
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,590

has to leave the tent immediately.

104
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,430

-Okay.

132

I only have one thought.

I would rather be
the person in the casket.

144

I don't want anything
to happen to my comrades.

145
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,750
That's why when we were in Isaia,

146
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,390
when Lieutenant Tian injured himself,

147
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,760
you overreacted.

148
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,790
It's not only because
Tian Yong injured himself.

149
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,370
It's also because of
your reckless behaviour

150
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,710
when we're organising the rescue.

151
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,890
The moment you lifted the robber's gun,

152
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,800
it's no different from committing suicide.

153
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,990
Do you know that?

154
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,050
If I didn't give it a second thought

155
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,390
and fired the gun at you,

156
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,440
I think my career as a military officer
would have stopped then.

157
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,400
I bet the complaint

158
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,720
must have caused you so much trouble.

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,550
I was number one
in the Hunter Military School assessment.

160
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,560
Then, I dropped to number two.

161
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,320

162
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,320

She contracted SARS
when she was taking care of the patients.

[Though she survived the disease,]

173

[her health deteriorated.]

174

was sent to my house,]

fear

185

is one of the human natures
that we have to get over.

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,430
my urge to play my role as a doctor

188
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,830
at disastrous times is stronger.

189
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,510
I don't want to live with regrets.

190
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,570
As such,

191
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,080
no matter what,

192
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,480
I'll guard the dyke.

193
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,800
I'll stay committed
and dedicated to my job.

194
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,120
I'll complete my duty.

195
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,030
Before my comrades give up,

196
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,520
I'll never give up.

197
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,520
Being committed doesn't mean
you don't have to take care of yourself.

198
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,990
Something bad will happen
if you don't rest well.

199
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,920
Are you worried about me?

200
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,050
Yes.

201
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,250
Why?

202
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,440
Why are you worried about me?

203
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm a doctor, Liang Mu Ze.

204
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,910
I can't stand it when someone
doesn't take care of themselves.

205
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,520
Thank you, Dr Xia.

206
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,590
They're back.

207
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,730
Brigade Commander!

208
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,330
Brigade Commander!

209
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,170
Sir.

210
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,000
It's the W4C9 virus.

211
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,450
No mutation is detected.

212
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,590
The vaccine is already on the way.

213
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,440
The isolation measures
were executed just in time.

214
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,400
We'll wait for the patients
to be vaccinated.

215
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,000
Then, conduct blood tests on the soldiers.

216
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,000
We'll give them a talk
on prevention and control

217
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,240
to prevent further infection.

218
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,810
Let's start working!

219
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,720
Yes!

220
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,350
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

221
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,040
Carry out full protection!

222
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,010
Yes!

223
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,530
Come with me!

224
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,450
See?

225
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,350
As usual, you hold us up again.

226
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,740
But,

227
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,920
well done!

228
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,350
-Report.
-Come in.

229
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,870
Captain, Xiao Teng's fever is gone.

230
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,070
How is he doing?

231
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,460
He's doing fine.

232
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,630
Xiang Yang is taking care of him.

233
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,470
He's still muddle-headed though.

234
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,590
He kept asking me,

235
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,230
"Where are the angels?"

236
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,760
What angels?

237
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,600
When he came down
with the fever, he thought

238
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,360
Dr Xia had a pair of wings.

239
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,000
Have the medical team left?

240
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,670
Not yet, they're on the dyke.

241
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,670
Brigade Commander wants to send them off.

242
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,120
Let's check it out.

243
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,110
Yes.

244
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,269
Thank you for your help.

245
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,920
-Don't mention it.
-Otherwise, god knows

246
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,480
what would happen to the soldiers.

247
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,809
It's our duty.

248
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,769
Thank you for the hard work.

249
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,350
Salute!

250
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,120
Take care.

251
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,490
I'll wait for you to come home.

252
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,430
All thanks to the doctors,

253
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,030
especially Dr Xia.

254
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,520
She looks fragile

255
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,350
but she takes her job so seriously.

256
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,640
Not only is she professional,

257
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,360
she is also kind-hearted.

258
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,560
She is such a nice lady.

259
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,000
What do you think, captain?

260
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,840
What's wrong? Are you having insomnia?

261
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm exhausted physically
but my brain keeps me awake.

262
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,790
These are my first sleeping pills
since I came here.

263
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,520
Every medicine has its side effects.
Don't...

264
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,770
What's wrong?

265
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,270
Something is wrong with the pills.

266
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,350
It looks like an effervescent tablet.

267
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,760
It dissolves in the water right away.

268
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,360
It melts in water.

269
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,040
At ease! Attention!

270
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,910
Look to the left!

271
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,880
Eyes front! At Ease.

272
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,200
Attention!

273
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,870
Later, according
to the order from the superior,

274
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,120
besides the injured soldiers
who are recuperating,

275
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,470
the rest who are
from combat battalion and Special Forces

276
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,520
are going to Zone Four.

277
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,050
Team Nine of the Special Forces Brigade
will stay back

278
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,480
as the reserve team, just in case.

279
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,720
Got it?

280
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,830
Yes!

281
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,040
It's the same formula.

282
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,630
The smell is so familiar.

283
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,790
Are you done being sentimental?

284
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,600
Dr Zhang.

285
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,800
How does leading a surgery feel?

286
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,230
Just like a nightmare, it's exciting!

287
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,810
Great.

288
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,360
Get ready to enter the theatre.

289
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,680
Now?

290
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,890
The heart transplant
which was scheduled earlier

291
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,330
had been postponed.

292
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,010
Of course, if you're not keen
to take part in it,

293
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,200
you may skip it.

294
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,190
I want to join.

295
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,160
-Sure.
-Dr Zhang.

296
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,900
Yes?

297
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,670
Xiao Xiao performed well too.

298
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,320
So?

299
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,050
She would like to watch

300
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,800
the heart transplant surgery.

301
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,760
Can both of us

302
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,930
enter the theatre together?

303
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,070
It's full.

304
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,960
There's only one vacancy
for a houseman.

305
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,040
Is there any question?

306
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,310
No.

307
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,320
All right, hurry up.

308
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,240
-In the next round...
-I won't thank you.

309
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,790
Next time, it'll be me.

310
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,890
This place

311
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,870
is a battlefield for patients.

312
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,630
It's also a battlefield for doctors.

313
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,930
Everyone who enters this place

314
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,470
is fighting for survival.

315
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,880
For life,

316
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,910
dignity,

317
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,170
responsibility,

318
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,600
and the irreplaceable
sense of accomplishment at work,

319
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,560
we put ourselves in tight spots
over and over again.

320
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,030
We fight hard against the God of Death.

321
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,930
If I chose the path

322
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,920
because of youth's passion,

323
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,190
then being persistent
throughout the journey

324
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,000
is because I have faith in the profession.

325
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,350
As the saying goes,

326
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,050
"The one who wants to wear a crown"

327
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,840
"must bear the weight."

328
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,390
I'm looking for a birthday present
for our daughter.

329
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,690
You told me

330
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,910
she likes dolls, right?

331
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,270
She doesn't like it anymore?

332
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,910
All right, I got it.

333
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,350
What is it? Say it.

334
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,370
No, no way!

335
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,910
It's not the right time.

336
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,330
When I'm done with my work,

337
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,750
I'll pay her a visit.

338
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,360
I don't know when I can get it done.

339
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,600
Stop speaking in English!

340
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,760
I don't understand English.

341
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,160
Listen...

342
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,890
Li Lei.

343
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,240
Rao Zhi, we found something.

344
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,230
Okay, got it. I'm coming back.

345
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,870
How is it?

346
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,650
Rao Zhi.

347
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,520
The information is provided by
the Intelligence Bureau.

348
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,490
Xiong

349
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,890
has been scrutinised by the narcotics
squad for a long time.

350
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,450
They suspect that his business

351
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,760
is just a camouflage.

352
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,090
He supplies
a type of Chinese shrub, Ephedra

353
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,410
which is one of the ingredients
to produce crystal meth

354
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,760
to drug cartels abroad.

355
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,710
Have the narcotics squad taken any action?

356
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,050
Not yet.

357
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,330
They haven't figured out

358
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,720
the mode of communication
and the transaction channel

359
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,970
between Xiong and the purchasers.

360
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,730
Just like us,

361
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,750
they're monitoring him.

362
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,560
Channel?

363
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,470
The City of Desire?

364
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,150
[Completing invasion]

365
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,660
[Please send the information
to my mailbox.]

366
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,360
Xiao Xiao, let's hang out tonight.

367
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,270
I can't make it. I'm on duty.

368
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,030
How about Xiao Chu?

369
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,200
I'll pass. Something happened at home.

370
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,930
I heard that front line flood fighters

371
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,320
have left the disaster area.

372
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,730
I guess your beloved military officer

373
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,320
is coming home, right?

374
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,910
He's not mine.

375
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,360
As for his whereabouts,

376
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,590
you have to ask him.

377
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,170
Goodbye, everyone.

378
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,430
Have fun!

379
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,440
She's so impatient.

380
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,350
Welcome home, Captain Liang.

381
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,790
I left my key in the military camp.

382
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,140
Take it.

383
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,020
What is this?

384
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,630
Give me a hug.

385
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,110
You bought custard steamed buns!

386
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,670
Yes, I crave it.

387
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,280
That's why I bought an extra portion.

388
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:38,150
♫ Heart is filled
with your little company everyday ♫

389
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,640
Finally you're back.
I've missed you so much!

390
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:48,220
♫ Can't miss a thing about you,
hence there is no regrets ♫

391
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,990
♫ Getting used to your habits
from breakfast to dinner ♫

392
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,770
♫ Spending every minute to stay with you ♫

393
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,280
Liang Mu Ze.

394
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,750
You should smile more frequently.

395
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,440
You look quite handsome when you smile.

396
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,270
How shallow.

397
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,230
Come join me for dinner
after you have unpacked.

398
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,390
♫ Liking your habits,
remembering small moments ♫

399
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,690
♫ Infecting sorrows with smiles ♫

400
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,900
♫ Getting used to what you like,
trying to be brave ♫

401
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,230
♫ Liking becomes natural
and turns into a habit ♫

402
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,980
♫ Even though it's simple, my heart
still fills with deep emotion for you ♫

403
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,800
I do look quite handsome.

404
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,350
How long will it take?
Should I start cooking?

405
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,310
You may cook now! I'm almost done!

406
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:50,660
♫ We're trying to keep it natural
and romantic at the same time ♫

407
00:27:52,420 --> 00:28:00,730
♫ Every time we slow down,
the whole world is filled with love ♫

408
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:10,720
♫ Can't miss a thing about you,
hence the path is simple yet dazzling ♫

409
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,490
♫ Liking your habits,
remembering small moments ♫

410
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,090
♫ Infecting sorrows with smiles ♫

411
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,340
♫ Getting used to what you like,
trying to be brave ♫

412
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:32,460
♫ Liking becomes natural
and turns into a habit ♫

413
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,180
By the way,

414
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,270
I prepared some pills for you.

415
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,370
Take one tablet
when you're having insomnia.

416
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,810
Don't overdose.

417
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,230
Every medicine has its side effects.

418
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,530
What's wrong?

419
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,240
Something is wrong with the medicine.

420
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,720
I'll leave Er Miao with you. Let's go.

421
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,120
Custard steamed bun will be ready soon.

422
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,550
Did you cook those dishes?

423
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,070
No, they're cooked by Ms Snail.

424
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,270
What a lame joke.

425
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,400
I love cooking.

426
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,480
Why?

427
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,000
Human heart is located above the stomach.

428
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,160
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

429
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,310
Is it scientifically proven?

430
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,130
Please trust the professional judgment

431
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,350
of a cardiac surgeon.

432
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,150
So much for professional judgment.

433
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,550
Have some soup.

434
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,030
[Have you taken the pills I gave you?]

435
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,570
[I took one.]

436
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,500
[You...]

437
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,800
[Did you notice anything?]

438
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,440
[What is it?]

439
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,960
You're indeed a straight guy.

440
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,970
Nothing.

441
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,000
How many days will you stay?

442
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,450
I'm going back to
the military camp tomorrow.

443
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,170
All your comrades are back, right?

444
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,190
Yes, they're back.

445
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,460
Good to hear that.

446
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,280
I was under the impression

447
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,950
doctors take life and death lightly.

448
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,320
I don't know about others

449
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,490
but I...

450
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't have the talent
to take it lightly.

451
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,360
When I was undergoing rotation
at the Obstetrics Department,

452
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,760
there was an old pregnant woman.

453
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,080
She couldn't give birth to the baby.

454
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,310
She held my hand and said,

455
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,240
"Doctor, it's too painful."

456
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,070
"I don't want to do it anymore."

457
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,710
Two minutes later,

458
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,670
she passed away due to
amniotic fluid embolism.

459
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,510
Her husband

460
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,200
while carrying the newborn

461
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,760
burst into loud sobs.

462
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,280
I never knew

463
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,600
a man could cry for so long.

464
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,320
That was the first time

465
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,520
I witnessed the death of a patient.

466
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,730
Until now, I still vividly remember

467
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,710
the moment she lied
on the operating table.

468
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,810
I always feel that a hand

469
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,590
is holding me down.

470
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,600
No matter how difficult it is,

471
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,150
she motivates me to run forward.

472
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,770
[I'm sorry.]

473
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,880
Five years ago, I went to Yunnan
for residency training.

474
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,230
I received a phone call from home

475
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,750
informing me that
my grandma was terminally ill.

476
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,880
I applied for leave and rushed home.

477
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,030
When I reached home,

478
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,520
my grandma was already unable to talk.

479
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,760
However, when she saw me,

480
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,880
she got agitated. She cried non-stop.

481
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,890
I don't think I would ever

482
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,230
understand how she felt.

483
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,400
I didn't know what to do.

484
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,110
I didn't know what I could do.

485
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,710
I sat at the bedside.

486
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,000
I held her hand

487
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,870
and sang her a song.

488
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,040
So, my grandma passed away

489
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,150
as I sang.

490
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,650
Then, I could feel the warmth of her palm

491
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,040
slowly disappearing.

492
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,630
In the end, it turned completely cold.

493
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,510
But at that moment,

494
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,510
I was really calm.

495
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:24,530
Yes.

496
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,750
Calm.

497
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:35,410
[Why are we talking about this]

498
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,120
[all of a sudden?]

499
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,000
You started it first.

500
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,450
However,

501
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,439
it's okay to talk about it.

502
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,550
Military officers and doctors

503
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,200
are two occupations

504
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,480
that are close to death.

505
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,000
We understand death.

506
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,000
That's why we cherish the moment.

507
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:55,470
When we're alive,

508
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,720
we won't miss out on
any wonderful moments.

509
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,410
Am I right?

510
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,390
You are afraid of missing out.

511
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,150
Do you want some?

512
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,190
Does it go well with Chinese cuisine?

513
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,310
I like it.

514
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,680
We deserve to take a well-earned break.

515
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,230
We can have some liquor.

516
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,110
Just a sip.

517
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,710
Bourbon Whiskey.

518
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,390
It's Matthew's favourite drink.

519
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,370
Who is that?

520
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,990
He's a detective
in Lawrence Block's novel.

521
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,990
When I was in high school,

522
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,120
a new student joined our class.

523
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,830
He sat beside me.

524
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,840
Under his influence,

525
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,040
I started reading detective novels.

526
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,110
He said

527
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,560
he wanted to be a detective novelist.

528
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,320
However,

529
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,470
due to the harsh reality,

530
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,630
he didn't realise his dream.

531
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,070
He said he wanted to be
a National Defence Student

532
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,320
and contribute to society
by joining the special forces.

533
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,690
Back then,

534
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,400
no matter what he said or what he did,

535
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,070
I always thought that he was right.

536
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,440
However, one day,

537
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,270
he disappeared from school.

538
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,080
I couldn't find him anywhere.

539
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,230
I didn't know where to find him.

540
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,080
I couldn't do anything besides reading

541
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,150
the detective novels he got me one by one.

542
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,350
Then, I bought more novels from
the book store.

543
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,790
I even hoped that

544
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,090
one day,

545
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,510
in one of the detective novels,

546
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,000
I could see his name, Zhuo Ran.

547
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,000
He is now neither a novelist
nor a military officer.

548
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,230
He set up a 3D printing company.

549
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,960
He's now a business owner.

550
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,310
I have retained a habit of his

551
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,600
in my own life.

552
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,120
However, I was already 18

553
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,910
and our high school memories

554
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,430
were gone for good.

555
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,030
[How about you, Liang Mu Ze?]

556
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,790
Do you practice

557
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,080
someone else's habit?

558
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,180
No.

559
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,000
Your life

560
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,580
is so boring.

561
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,300
Because of his ambition,

562
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,180
you're not interested
in military officers, is that it?

563
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,090
What do you mean?

564
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,460
The other day,

565
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,220
you told him,

566
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,900
for a very long time,

567
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,820
you couldn't even stand the phrase,
"special forces soldier,"

568
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,740
let alone seeing one.

569
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,460
You eavesdropped on me?

570
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,460
No, I didn't.

571
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,820
I can read lips.

572
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,780
Just a bit.

573
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,500
However, I could understand what you said.

574
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,420
Cheers.

575
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,740
Good morning.

576
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
Good morning.

577
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,740
Did you stay awake
for the whole night again?

578
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,360
What say you?

579
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,200
You look energetic.

580
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,700
You have sharp eyes.

581
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,130
You're not humble at all, Braised Egg.

582
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,280
What?

583
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,850
I'm complimenting your head shape.

584
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,100
Thank you for the compliment.

585
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,220
What are you looking for?

586
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,900
"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders."

587
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,900
You're still reading it?

588
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,300
Didn't I tell you the ending?

589
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,860
I'll never get sick of reading you.

590
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,890
It feels like spring when I read you.

591
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,170
What are you saying?

592
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,420
I'm talking about the book.

593
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,820
What were you thinking?

594
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,380
It was on the shelf.

595
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,460
Where is it?

596
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,420
Do you have any plans later?

597
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,020
No, I don't have any plans.

598
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,260
I'm going to chill in the morning
before going to the hospital.

599
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,050
Let's take a stroll
at the furniture store.

600
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,780
I want to change some of the furniture.
Give me some suggestions.

601
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,740
Sure.

602
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,650
♫ The sky is smiling
and my heart is fluttering ♫

603
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:55,060
♫ Time stops as we're surrounded
by happiness ♫

604
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,810
♫ I always have the urge
to hold you in my arms ♫

605
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,540
♫ Though we argue at times ♫

606
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,220
♫ Though we fight at times ♫

607
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,110
♫ We chit-chat the whole night through ♫
♫ ​The sweetness is just right ♫

608
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:15,390
♫ We share the same taste in food ♫
♫ The sweetness is just right ♫

609
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,830
♫ No one knows
what triggered our first fight ♫

610
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,160
♫ When we think back, love is a wonder ♫

611
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,110
Xia Chu.

612
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,910
♫ Our encounter is not too old school ♫
♫ The amount of happiness is just right ♫

613
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,880
♫ Our connection is not too boring ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

614
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,460
♫ No one ever notices
your smiling lashes ♫

615
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:46,580
♫ We don't have to think about it
as we are destined to meet ♫

616
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,860
Slow down.

617
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,900
It's so comforting.

618
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,370
Finally it doesn't look like
a sample house.

619
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,620
Er Miao, come on, try out the new couch.

620
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,330
Er Miao!

621
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,820
You're not giving me face.

622
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:09,110
♫ The sky is smiling
and my heart is fluttering ♫

623
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,430
♫ Time stops as we're surrounded
by happiness ♫

624
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,130
♫ I always have the urge
to hold you in my arms ♫

625
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,610
♫ Though we argue at times ♫

626
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,220
I think I'm out of favour.

627
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,550
♫ Though we fight at times ♫

628
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,520
Like this?

629
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,540
-Like this?
-Yes.

630
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,130
♫ We chit-chat the whole night through ♫
♫ ​The sweetness is just right ♫

631
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,220
It's quite nice.

632
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,410
♫ We share the same taste in food ♫
♫ The sweetness is just right ♫

633
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,700
Come here.

634
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,860
♫ No one knows
what triggered our first fight ♫

635
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,650
One, two, three!

636
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:44,050
♫ When we think back, love is a wonder ♫

637
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,820
♫ Our encounter is not too old school ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

638
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:53,920
♫ Our connection is not too boring ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

639
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,610
♫ No one ever notices
your smiling lashes ♫

640
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:05,340
♫ We don't have to think about it
as we are destined to meet ♫

641
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,180
What are you doing?

642
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,020
Do you want some?

643
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,660
You haven't lost all your conscience.

644
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,970
Why are you laughing?

645
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,660
Nothing.

646
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,900
You can't have it unless you tell me.

647
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,230
I suddenly recalled the first time

648
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,970
we had custard steamed bun in the store.

649
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,460
I had the urge to squeeze the custard

650
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,060
onto your face.

651
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,500
It's never crossed my mind.

652
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,260
Here.

653
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,400
Liang Mu Ze, that's inhumane!

654
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,510
Don't move!

655
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,500
Go back!

656
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,570
I didn't see anything.

657
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,580
The memory has been deleted.

658
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,620
I'll go get changed. Clean up the mess.

659
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,660
By the way,
don't forget to clean the litter.

660
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,820
Why?

661
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,650
Fine, I'll do it.
