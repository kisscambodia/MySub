[Episode 14]

4
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,400
Zhuo Ran.

5
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,690
Did you notice that

6
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,959
you're especially unlucky
when you're with me?

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,340
You either injure yourself or fall sick.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,320
Perhaps we're not meant to be together.

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,880
How about this?

10
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,400
I'll stay away from you.

11
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,880
I know I'm quite annoying at times.

12
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,630
Mi Gu.

13
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,560
It's not your fault.

14
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't mind.

15
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,440
Did I interrupt you?

16
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,800
We're coming in.

17
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,070
Hello, Mr Zhuo and Ms Mi.

18
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,300
With regard to the incident

19
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:40,930
outside the banquet hall at the hotel,

20
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,240
it's indeed tricky and troublesome.

21
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,770
Now, we need cooperation
from both of you

22
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,000
to give a statement.

23
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,170
He's still bleeding.

24
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,130
Can we do it later?

25
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,120
No.

26
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,000
Please cooperate with us.
It won't be long.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,800
-You...
-Mi Gu.

28
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,730
It's okay.

29
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,770
Do we do it together or...

30
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,880
Do it separately.

31
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,200
Come with me.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,980
He's a lunatic.

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,690
He's been pestering me a long time
insisting to date me.

34
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,850
Have you ever given him any promises?

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,990
Of course not.

36
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,400
I don't know.

37
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,360
Don't know?

38
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,220
Ms Mi Gu and I

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,920
met each other not long ago.

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,529
I'm not quite familiar

41
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,080
with her romantic experience.

42
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,200
So,

43
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,830
both of you are not close with each other?

44
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,360
Yes, you may say so.

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,440
All thanks to Zhuo Ran.

46
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,330
That's why I escaped.

47
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,170
Why did he

48
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,000
ask for your help to obtain
the licence of the forum?

49
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,410
He's a businessman.

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,110
Isn't it normal for him
to expand his connection?

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,620
I couldn't help but wonder

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,100
why you chose to attend

53
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,060
a medicine related forum?

54
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,510
My company

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,710
is mainly about 3D printing.

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,110
Lately, we're doing a collaboration

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,700
with the hospital.

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,430
Therefore, I'm interested
to get an understanding

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,330
of the related industry information.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,470
You're indeed far-sighted

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,820
and in the full vigour of life.

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,570
Do you know this person?

63
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,010
No.

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,310
No.

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,610
Does Zhuo Ran know him?

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,100
How do I know?

67
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,660
Why do you keep asking about Zhuo Ran?

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,300
He's not the person who assaulted me.

69
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,020
We need to get a better understanding
of every detail at the scene.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,190
Take off your shirt.

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,950
We received complaints
from the public

72
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,540
that you

73
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,270
illegally possessed a gun.

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,780
We need to confirm on that.

75
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,850
Can you give me a hand?

76
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,270
Okay, no problem.

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,710
What a nice material.

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,340
Please raise your hands.

79
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,890
It seems that it was just a mischief.

80
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,710
Mr Zhuo, I'm so sorry.

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,420
People who simply take up police resources

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,780
should be taught a lesson.

83
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,940
That's all for today.

84
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,940
You're working for the people.

85
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,670
I can understand that.

86
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,010
All right, see you again.

87
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,010
Please sign the document
if everything is okay.

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,740
It's not working.

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,820
Do you have any other pen?

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,200
I have a pen.

91
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,850
Do you?

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,020
It's done.

93
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,770
Use it.

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,740
Thank you for your cooperation.

95
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,470
What do you keep in your bag?

96
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,610
It looks quite heavy.

97
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,650
It's camera.
I need it for working purposes.

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,040
Let's go.

99
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,660
Mi Gu.

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,500
It's not your fault.

101
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,470
I heard from my dad
that someone assaulted you.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,660
Are you okay?

103
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,020
Are you injured?

104
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,420
I'm fine.

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,630
Zhuo Ran injured himself though.

106
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,090
Is it serious?

107
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,950
According to the doctor,

108
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,780
his nerves and bones are intact.

109
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,930
I think he should be fine.

110
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,180
Where is he?

111
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,500
He's undergoing debridement.

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,250
Well...

113
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,180
I went to the hotel
for film shooting on location.

114
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,260
He was there to attend a medical forum.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,490
We...

116
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,350
We were there for work

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,570
and we ran into each other by chance.

118
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,660
Something unexpected occurred.

119
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,390
As he's bleeding profusely,

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,290
-I sent him to the hospital.
-Actually...

121
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,859
Don't mind it.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,980
Take a seat.

123
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,180
I mean,

124
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,420
to Zhuo Ran, I...

125
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,780
Yes.

126
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,140
When I saw him,

127
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,150
I still felt something

128
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,810
which couldn't be explained.

129
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,940
However, I think

130
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,770
it's not because of him per se

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,050
but it's because of the memories.

132
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,360
Everything in the past happened for real

133
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,240
and it won't happen again in the future.

134
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,860
Hence, I won't forget it.

135
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,940
Sometimes, we couldn't help reminiscing

136
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,660
those guys in white shirts

137
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,940
who played basketball on the court.

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,830
However, it's just nostalgia.

139
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,379
Life goes on no matter what.

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,780
The story between Zhuo Ran
and I has ended.

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,860
As for you,

142
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,050
if he really makes you happy,

143
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,120
then you should go ahead.

144
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,580
I thought

145
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,180
you wouldn't talk to me anymore.

146
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,260
Just because of a former lover?

147
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,890
Am I so petty?

148
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,340
To me,

149
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,780
a serious friendship

150
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,780
is more memorable than
romantic relationship.

151
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,300
I love you, Mi Gu.

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,970
Any man

153
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,630
can never take your place in my heart.

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,380
I've to get back to work.

155
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,740
Call me if anything.

156
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,150
Why did you bring me to the hospital?

157
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,190
Didn't I tell you to send me home?

158
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,420
We're here to apologise.

159
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,490
What?

160
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,030
Hello.

161
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,470
Hello.

162
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,580
Is Xia Chu here?

163
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,710
I think she went to the emergency ward.

164
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,910
You may give her a call.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,170
All right, thank you.

166
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,620
-I don't want to go there.
-Let's go.

167
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,420
Thank you for your help at the hotel.

168
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,260
Have you taken the medicine?

169
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,310
What?

170
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,370
-What are you doing?
-It's tranquillizer.

171
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,540
I told Mi Gu to replace the tranquillizer.

172
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,980
Have you taken it?

173
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,370
The tranquillizer is not for myself.

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,220
I gave it to Liang Mu Ze.

175
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,780
Tell him to throw it away.

176
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,860
What's wrong?

177
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,710
My company had a collaboration
with a medicine manufacturer before.

178
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,670
We attempted to use 3D printing technology

179
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,610
to produce hypnotic
which is made of Chinese medicine.

180
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,610
However, the first batch

181
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,420
contains excessive birthwort.

182
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,510
Long term consumption

183
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,500
may lead to kidney failure
or worse, liver cancer.

184
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,760
Hence, we decided to destroy the products.

185
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,270
My assistant took it by mistake.

186
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,860
I didn't know that

187
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,320
and I gave it to Mi Gu.

188
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,550
Normally, when a man and a woman
are together

189
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,230
and they did not pick up the phone call
at first instance,

190
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,670
it's either they're busy
or they're having fun.

191
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,980
Don't ask for embarrassment.

192
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,610
Xia Chu.

193
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,110
It was an accident.

194
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,720
Luckily nothing happened to you.

195
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,420
I'm fine

196
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,000
but my friend almost took

197
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,260
substandard medicine.

198
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,170
Do you know

199
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,530
how much of trouble you caused me?

200
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,940
If his health is affected

201
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,450
because of my negligence,

202
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,640
I won't be able to forgive myself.

203
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,330
Also,

204
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,540
before you make any decision

205
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,160
that has something to do with me,

206
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,250
will you please

207
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,620
inform me about it?

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,890
Don't simply do whatever you want.

209
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,260
Don't get Mi Gu
involved in your so-called accidents.

210
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,900
Please don't hurt me over and over again

211
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,640
in the name of protecting me.

212
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,530
She looks like she's having fun.

214
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,400
Where did you go?

215
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,800
Take a guess.

216
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,240
Where did you find her?

217
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,880
Well...

218
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,160
Sorry to have troubled you
to pick her up at the airport.

219
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,240
Mu Ze.

220
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm tired.

221
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,420
She...

222
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,380
What's wrong?

223
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,460
She fell asleep due to her illness.

224
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,800
Let's go to your office.

225
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,760
Let's go.

226
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,320
Zhuo Ran.

227
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,640
You're still here.

228
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,000
I went to pick up the medicine.

229
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,530
The doctor prescribed medicine

230
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,010
for tetanus and antibiotics.

231
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,990
Thank you.

232
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,970
Let's go to the injection room.

233
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,320
Okay.

234
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,940
Do you plan to leave her here?

235
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,850
Yes, if I send her home,

236
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,920
she'll run away once she's awake.

237
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,800
Even if you leave her here,

238
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,000
I can't be watching her all the time.

239
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,400
Are you busy?

240
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,640
Of course.

241
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,380
At night, if any emergency

242
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,580
happens to any of the patients,

243
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,330
I have to handle it at the first instance.

244
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,810
Why were you

245
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,410
hugging a man in the lift?

246
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,620
The test result of the medicine is out.

247
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,600
I know.

248
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,410
It's Chinese medicine
produced by 3D printing technology.

249
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,770
Zhang Yi Chi told you that?

250
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,450
No, it's Zhuo Ran.

251
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,400
Zhuo Ran told you about it?

252
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,530
He told his assistant to get the medicine.

253
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,200
His assistant got confused.

254
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,370
-So, he's the one who gave it to Mi Gu?
-Yes.

255
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,210
However, he didn't know that
his assistant made a mistake.

256
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,440
Was that his explanation?

257
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,100
I believe that it's the truth.

258
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,180
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have had come to to see me

259
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,440
at the first instance.

260
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,040
Did he know that
I was testing the medicine?

261
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,480
I didn't tell him anything.

262
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,680
How about Mi Gu?

263
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm not sure of that.

264
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,280
He's...

265
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,530
trying to get us before we get him.

266
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,130
It's just an accident.

267
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,000
You don't have to come down
on him too hard.

268
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,900
Accident?

269
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,170
Of course it's an accident.

270
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,970
Otherwise,

271
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,250
why would Zhuo Ran harm me?

272
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,170
The medicine was for me.

273
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,560
He didn't know that.

274
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,170
How did he know
that you have the medicine?

275
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,890
How did he know?

276
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,180
For a very long time

277
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,810
after he left,

278
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,780
I could only fall asleep

279
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,090
with the help of drugs.

280
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,680
When I had insomnia,

281
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,080
I sent many emails to him.

282
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,610
In some emails, I scolded him.

283
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,400
In some, I begged of him.

284
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,600
He didn't reply any of the emails.

285
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,170
He didn't reply

286
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,610
but I think he knew

287
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,370
what was going on with me.

288
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,810
Therefore, when he came back,

289
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,970
he worried that I got agitated.

290
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,930
He told Mi Gu to keep a close watch on me

291
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,990
just in case.

292
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,400
As a result,

293
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,520
he accidentally discovered the medicine.

294
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,260
Trust me, Liang Mu Ze.

295
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,760
Zhuo Ran wouldn't harm me.

296
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,400
There's no reason for him
to make things personal against you too.

297
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,170
This is just

298
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,920
an odd coincidence.

299
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,570
In short,

300
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,690
I'm sorry for this incident.

301
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,170
If you get mad at me or hate me for that,

302
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,360
I can totally understand it.

303
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,730
However, I can't doubt my friend.

304
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,880
This is my principle
when it comes to dealing with people.

305
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:21,480
Are both of you just friends?

306
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,360
Liang Mu Ze, what do you mean?

307
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,970
There's an eight year gap.

308
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,319
Are you sure you still know him well?

309
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,040
Also, how old are you?

310
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,440
Running away from home

311
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,460
was a trick I used when I was young.

312
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,530
You can't be using the same trick
all the time.

313
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,920
It'll become ineffective.

314
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,320
Think like an adult.

315
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,610
You may fight me or mess around

316
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,720
but you're not allowed
to run away from home.

317
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,300
Got it?

318
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,660
You just want me to stay home

319
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,170
and take care of your cousin.

320
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,170
That's right.

321
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,480
[Zhuo Ran didn't have a gun with him.]

322
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,330
[The meeting concluded successfully.]

323
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,350
[I'm back to the camp.]

324
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,240
Zhuo Ran switched my medicine.

325
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,040
It's not a coincidence for sure.

326
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,360
Something must be wrong with him.

327
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,160
Keep a close watch on him.

328
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,300
What's wrong?

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,220
Professor Xia is receiving
physiotherapy treatment. It's ending soon.

330
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,980
Tang Lin wants us to wait for him.

331
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,340
Zhuo Ran.

332
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,280
Officer Liang.

333
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,850
Why did you attend the medical forum?

334
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,760
What's wrong?

335
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,730
Are you going to question me again

336
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,920
like those police officers?

337
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,860
At that moment, you behaved

338
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,600
as if you're fully prepared.

339
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,560
It's all about upbringing.

340
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,280
I must protect a lady

341
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,080
who was assaulted by a violent guy.

342
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,420
How about changing away my medicine?

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,480
Who were you trying to protect? Xia Chu?

344
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,220
It was me.

345
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,970
I'm asking you a question.

346
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,660
What happened?

348
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,600
Xia Chu doesn't need your protection.

349
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,520
Stay away from her.

350
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,860
Can you stay by her side

351
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,410
twenty-four hours a day?

352
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,930
When I am by her side,

353
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,530
what can you do for her

354
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,430
being in the military camp?

355
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,730
Try me.

356
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,770
Who is he?

357
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,020
Why did he mention about Xia Chu?

358
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,920
Do they know each other?

359
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,320
Professor Xia.

360
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,140
He

361
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,320
is Liang Mu Ze.

362
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,010
He's an officer with
the Special Forces Brigade.

363
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,660
He's just an uncultured person

364
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,480
who is not good at
controlling his emotion.

365
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,000
It seems that he's one of
Xia Chu's admirers too.

366
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,330
Rao Zhi, finally he said something.

367
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,360
He wants to see you.

368
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,250
Have you thought it through?

369
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,530
Are you their leader?

370
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,950
Yes.

371
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,090
Leader.

372
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,850
No, I mean Chief.

373
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,290
I really had no idea that

374
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,160
there were many other things in the car.

375
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,470
[I trust you.]

376
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,250
[But would the person who met you
believe you?]

377
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,930
No, Chief.

378
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,410
Please believe me.

379
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,100
I accepted a job on the internet.

380
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,070
I was told to get a new car
when I reached there.

381
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,570
That lad didn't escape, did he?

382
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,170
What do you think?

383
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,930
Not only did he not escape,

384
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,490
he sold you out.

385
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,070
He said you betrayed him.

386
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,560
He's talking nonsense.

387
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,090
[I get nothing if I betray him.]

388
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,060
[Betraying him]

389
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,730
is no different than betraying myself.

390
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,960
Fine.

391
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm no stranger to people like you.

392
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,090
Hurry up.

393
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,810
Tell me everything that you know.

394
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,890
Listen, Chief.

395
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm

396
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,800
always unlucky.

397
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,530
You know what?

398
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,530
I ran into a silly lady.

399
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,010
That lady...

400
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,050
You'd better contact her parents
as soon as possible.

401
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
That young lady is crazy.

402
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,650
Something is truly wrong with her.

403
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,060
I'm worried about her.

404
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,640
When her illness strikes,

405
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,130
in just a split second,

406
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,400
she may destroy her whole family.

407
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,680
She always...

408
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,530
You don't have to worry
about that young lady.

409
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,850
You'd better worry about yourself.

410
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,610
Okay, got it.

411
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,740
If I come clean,

412
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,050
will you protect me?

413
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,760
You're not in the position to negotiate.

414
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,840
We'll ensure your safety.

415
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,040
Answering all the questions honestly

416
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,910
is the best way to save yourself.

417
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,200
The cross-border crimes

418
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,250
is unique.

419
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,740
The criminal knew that
we wouldn't conduct security check

420
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,120
on the VIP's car.

421
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,650
They filled the door

422
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,050
and other compartments

423
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,370
in two identical commercial vehicles

424
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,440
with gold and drugs.

425
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,300
They intended

426
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,500
to get the transaction done in a fast way

427
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,810
by exchanging cars.

428
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,690
According to Liu Zheng Min,

429
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,970
the real owner of the sapphire

430
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,720
is someone by the name of Old Master.

431
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,170
He's the one

432
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,690
who made Liu Zheng Min
took a photo of the sapphire.

433
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,040
In the name of Old Master,

434
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,240
he also transferred the sapphire
to the deceased in the bungalow,

435
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,430
Sang Kun.

436
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,210
Sang Kun

437
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,770
is kind of a big shot.

438
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,410
Under his financial aid, T4

439
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,120
developed along the way.

440
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,610
However, in recent years,

441
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,650
he's down with kidney failure.

442
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,700
As such, T4

443
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,400
has been controlled by

444
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,910
Old Master who has the real power.

445
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,190
As for him,

446
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,640
he's been

447
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,400
looking for a kidney for transplant.

448
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,780
Not long ago, the kidnapping case

449
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,170
that happened to
the Isaia Joint Medical Team

450
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,280
is also related to him.

451
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,680
His murder

452
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,250
is most likely a result of

453
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,730
the internal conflict in T4.

454
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,400
Judging from the current situation,

455
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,040
we're unable to ascertain

456
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,340
the identity of Old Master.

457
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,090
Liu Zheng Min also said that

458
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,890
he's never seen Old Master.

459
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,820
He always

460
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,940
contacted him through a middle person

461
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,060
on City of Desire.

462
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,940
Middle person?

463
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,820
Was it the person who met with him today?

464
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,580
No.

465
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,480
That person is Gui's lackey.

466
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,130
According to Liu Zheng Min's statement,

467
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,450
the person who was supposed

468
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,840
to meet up with him for transaction
was Sang Kun's younger brother,

469
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,810
Bai Sen, whose nickname is Gui.

470
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,220
Last year,

471
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,930
when Gui came to China

472
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,620
to find a cure for his elder brother,

473
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,920
both of them met once.

474
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,690
According to Liu Zheng Min's description

475
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,380
and the surveillance recording
at the scene,

476
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,570
we did a comparison.

477
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,520
We've targeted the suspect
who was blended in with the guests,

478
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,890
Gui.

479
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,050
He disguised as Ba Song.

480
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,970
He pretended to be a legal representative

481
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,290
of a foreign listed company

482
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,140
as a cover.

483
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,680
He was invited to attend
the medical forum.

484
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,090
Why did he send his lackey

485
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,500
to meet Xiong

486
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,810
but he attended the forum instead?

487
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,650
What was his plan?

488
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,210
Xiong is unsure of his plan.

489
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,130
It looks like

490
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,450
only when we find Gui

491
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,880
can we find out more.

492
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,020
At the nearby street of the scene,

493
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,780
we stopped a Chevrolet car

494
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,690
which was ferrying Gui.

495
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,660
We only found a severely injured driver.

496
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,940
He was announced dead
not long after he reached the hospital.

497
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,380
As for Gui's whereabouts,

498
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,720
we're still locating him.

499
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,600
Did the sniper who was hiding
in the residential area

500
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,980
find any clues?

501
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,330
We contacted the management department
to get the surveillance recording

502
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,890
and we found that only the recording

503
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,460
of the said building had gone missing.

504
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,700
We could only leave it to
the technology department

505
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,980
to recover the recording.

506
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,860
At the same time,

507
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,100
we tried to find out
the relevant information

508
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,620
by interviewing the residents.

509
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,180
However, the progress is slow.

510
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,370
We're unable to ascertain his identity
at the moment.

511
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,900
All right, let me

512
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,970
explain the coming work arrangements.

513
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,690
For Team A,

514
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,050
continue locating Gui's whereabouts.

515
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,970
You may send the relevant information

516
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,980
to the Command Center.

517
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,900
Ask them to look out for us too.

518
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,870
Got it.

519
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,340
Team B,

520
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,330
continue look out for the hidden clues

521
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,060
on City of Desire.

522
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,980
Find out if Gui and the sniper

523
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,280
share any form of contact.

524
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,440
Team C,

525
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,490
follow up with Zhuo Ran, the man
who was suspected of possessing a gun.

526
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,180
No doubt we didn't find

527
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,720
any gun on him,

528
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,130
but taking into consideration

529
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,460
there was a time gap,

530
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,730
he's most likely
transferred the gun to somewhere else.

531
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,660
Besides that,

532
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,760
based on the surveillance recording
at the scene,

533
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,700
when Gui saw Zhuo Ran,

534
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,090
he behaved strangely.

535
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,420
Hence,

536
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,220
we must find out his background.

537
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,740
Make sure you leave no stone unturned.

538
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,490
-Got it?
-Yes.

539
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,960
Slow down.

540
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,550
I live next door.

541
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,030
Let me know if anything.

542
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,170
Okay.

543
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,840
Thank you for your help.

544
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,500
Rest early.

545
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,280
Mi Gu.

546
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,000
The interview...

547
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,210
It's okay, Mr Xia.

548
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,770
We can talk about it when you feel better.

549
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,340
That's great.

550
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,000
Let me...

551
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,830
Rest early.

552
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,420
Mr Zhuo.

553
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,900
Please send Mi Gu off.

554
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,370
It's okay. I should do that.

555
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,740
This is my name card.

556
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,220
When Professor Xia is in Ningjiang

557
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,290
and if he needs anything,
he may contact me at any time.

558
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,280
Thank you.

559
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,650
If it weren't for you,

560
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,780
god knows how huge of a mess

561
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,240
that madman would make.

562
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,750
I'm glad that everyone is safe.

563
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,210
Let's go.

564
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,540
Sure, let me get ready
for tomorrow's forum.

565
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,690
I'll see you off.

566
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,930
Goodbye.

567
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,320
Goodbye.

568
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,790
Zhuo Ran.

569
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,560
I'm home.

570
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,820
You should go up.

571
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,300
Hold on.

572
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,830
I've something to return to you.

573
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,770
Is this yours?

574
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,070
Don't you think you need to explain to me?

575
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,580
I'm exhausted, Mi Gu.

576
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm exhausted too.

577
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,810
I was on tenterhooks at the hospital.

578
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,540
I wanted to ask you

579
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,120
but I worried that someone
might find out about it.

580
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,960
Where did it come from?

581
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,910
Why did you keep a gun with you?

582
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,910
It's fake.

583
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,570
It's just a toy.

584
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,080
Then why didn't you inform me before hand?

585
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,840
It was an emergency.

586
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,450
I did it subconsciously.

587
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,330
You knew that the police officers
would conduct a search on you.

588
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,040
I only know that all the police officers
in the world are the same.

589
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,100
If they found out that

590
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,640
I brought a toy gun with me,

591
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,010
they would interrogate me non-stop

592
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,760
and then choose to believe
what they want to believe.

593
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,420
I didn't want to put myself in trouble.

594
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,120
What if I got myself into trouble?

595
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,610
If that ever happened,

596
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,570
I would explain to them.

597
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,960
You hugged me

598
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,970
just to hide the gun

599
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,520
and avoid the risk, right?

600
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,280
Am I right, Zhuo Ran?

601
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,640
No.

602
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,180
At that moment,

603
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,480
I wanted to give you some comfort.

604
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm going upstairs.

605
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,350
Have you found Gui?

606
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,560
You're asking me?

607
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,520
He ran away under your nose.
Why are you asking me?

608
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,060
The situation was a chaos.

609
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,520
It was chaotic, yes.

610
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,780
You've been making errors
in the past few missions.

611
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,530
Don't tell me it's an accident.

612
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,960
What else could it be?

613
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,490
What do you think it is?

614
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,730
Don't think that you can
check and balance Old Master

615
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,120
by releasing Gui.

616
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,500
If you don't want your mum...

617
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,740
Don't talk about my mum!

618
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,770
For your mum's sake,

619
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,280
you'd better stop playing tricks!

620
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,570
Old Master.

621
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,640
[Are you done with Gui?]

622
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,610
I'm sorry.

623
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,250
[You know that I hate apologies the most.]

624
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,320
I know.

625
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,090
However,

626
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,730
though Gui escaped,

627
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,240
we finally got to meet Xia Guang Yuan.

628
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,850
He's changed his mind about me
due to the incident.

629
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,290
Hence,

630
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,020
it's not completely a bust.

631
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,020
What went wrong in the process?

632
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,140
Liang Mu Ze.

633
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,290
Who?

634
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,690
[He's the Chinese military officer]

635
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,180
who I had bugs installed at his place.

636
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,760
Xia Chu is living at his place.

637
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,080
They're quite close.

638
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,850
Because of him,

639
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,330
Gui escaped.

640
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,340
[His presence has made my attempt]

641
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,240
[to approach Xia Chu even harder.]

642
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,080
I wanted to kill him before

643
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,439
but I failed.

644
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,919
He's a Special Forces soldier

645
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,330
and he usually live in the military camp.

646
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,810
It's difficult to go near him.

647
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:22,089
Even if I get to approach him,

648
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,320
it would be

649
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,890
too risky

650
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,859
to take action in China.

651
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,260
Unless...

652
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,399
[Unless what?]

653
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,580
Unless we can find a chance

654
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,480
to end him

655
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,919
when he receives training abroad.

656
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,750
The difficulty

657
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,050
[will be much lower.]

658
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,120
End him abroad?

659
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,790
Zhuo Ran.

660
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:43,600
[You're really something.]

661
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,250
Just by one line,

662
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,089
you passed the problem to me.

663
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,600
You can send Long Yi.

664
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,700
Are you trying to get rid of me?

665
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,240
You serve no purpose here.

666
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,970
[Enough.]

667
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,260
[Your mission]

668
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,689
[is to look for Gui
and nail Xia Guang Yuan.]

669
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,280
As for Liang Mu Ze who may spoil our plan,

670
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,800
send his particulars to me.

671
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,190
Got it.

672
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,840
What should we do?

673
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,840
It's not difficult to trace Gui.

674
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,080
It's easy for you to say.

675
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,930
Keep a close eye on
the police and Xia Guang Yuan.

676
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,180
The police are looking for him
and he's looking for Xia Guang Yuan.

677
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,720
We'll find something eventually.

678
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,050
What on earth is this?

679
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,920
Who is she?

680
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,640
Meet each other.

681
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,600
She's Liang Mu Ze's cousin.
Her name is Liang Shao Xue.

682
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,360
Be careful.

683
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,040
Don't let her crush you to death.

684
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,530
This is my place!

685
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,670
Look after her. I need to take a rest.

686
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,860
Please don't leave.

687
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,450
Where is this?

688
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,960
What's wrong?

689
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,840
It has nothing to do with me.

690
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,850
Where is this?

691
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,910
This...

692
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,660
This is Liang Mu Ze's place.

693
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,440
How is it possible?

694
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,570
No way Mu Ze has a pet cat.

695
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,330
It licked my face!

696
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,090
Don't be dramatic.

697
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,520
Calm down.

698
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,840
It's early in the morning.

699
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,170
Don't make a ruckus.

700
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,540
Don't irritate our neighbour

701
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,860
or they may report it to the police.

702
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,460
Leave me alone!

703
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,170
I'm about to explode!

704
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,030
Calm down.

705
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,650
You're completely awake.

706
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
If I hadn't woken up,

707
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,810
I might have been sold off
without knowing it.

708
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,040
Do you remember
yesterday, in the afternoon,

709
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,070
you suddenly fell asleep
at the corridor in the hospital?

710
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,520
Falling asleep is normal.

711
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,540
I was dealing with jet lag.

712
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,940
I didn't say that it's abnormal.

713
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,690
I just want to remind you that

714
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,490
when you were in a deep sleep,

715
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,770
it was me

716
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,740
who brought you home

717
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,450
despite being completely
burnt out after a night shift.

718
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,580
Not only did you not thank me,

719
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,300
you're dubious of me.

720
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,720
You suspected that I would sell you off!

721
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,540
Fine, it's okay.

722
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,490
You can question me all you want.

723
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,600
But now,

724
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,460
I beg of you.

725
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,780
Will you keep quiet

726
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,540
and let me take a nap?

727
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,500
That's because I need to work

728
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,900
in the afternoon.

729
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,860
Okay?

730
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,280
Repeat!

731
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,250
-What?
-Repeat

732
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,560
the last word.

733
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,900
I said so many things.

734
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,860
The last...

735
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,810
What did I say?

736
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,920
I said I need to work in the afternoon.

737
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,570
Okay?

738
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,250
OK?

739
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,540
What should I do? I forgot about OK!

740
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,880
How could I forgot OK?

741
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,010
My OK!

742
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,880
Report.

743
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,720
Come in.

744
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,160
Brigade Commander.

745
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,690
The police have forwarded the summary

746
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,210
of the action to me.

747
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,120
I'm waiting for
a detailed report from you.

748
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,200
Something happened in the process.

749
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,960
However, it went on smoothly in general.

750
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,200
Sure, it's okay.

751
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,940
Later,

752
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,570
please submit a report in detail.

753
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,970
By the way,

754
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,200
have an internal meeting

755
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,600
with everyone who took part in the action

756
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,960
to conclude the matter.

757
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,820
Yes.

758
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,700
Also,

759
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,980
I received instruction
from the higher authorities

760
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,480
to send a team to
the Central Asian military training

761
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,360
which will be held by Willick
at the end of the month.

762
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,590
End of the month?

763
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,930
We don't have much time.

764
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,080
You'll be leading the team
during the training camp.

765
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,520
How long will it take?

766
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,230
It's tentatively scheduled for a week.

767
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,030
However,
it depends on the training progress.

768
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,490
Do you have any question?

769
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,450
No.

770
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,040
Get ready.
Military reform is just around the corner.

771
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,850
This is a rare opportunity.

772
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,530
Don't make any mistake.

773
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,290
Yes, sir.

774
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,120
[Can you stay by her side]

775
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,640
[twenty-four hours a day?]

776
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,110
[When I am by her side,]

777
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,010
[what can you do for her]

778
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,890
[being in the military camp?]

779
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,990
Brigade Commander
wants me to check on you.

780
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,330
Why?

781
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,220
He thinks that you're not in a good mood

782
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,480
after executing the mission.

783
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,170
It turns out that
Xia Chu is also suffering from insomnia.

784
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,060
Why can't she fall asleep?

785
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,530
It's because of her first love.

786
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,600
You...

787
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,330
Are you in a bad mood?

788
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,080
No.

789
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,860
I'm worried.

790
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,290
I think this guy

791
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,990
has some hidden agendas.

792
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,080
Hello.

793
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,270
[Old Master.]

794
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,260
[The military]

795
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,690
[invited the special forces of China
for a training camp.]

796
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,800
[It seems that]

797
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,540
[the person who you're interested in]

798
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,880
[is in the participant list.]

799
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,780
[I've sent you his particulars
through email.]

800
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,310
You may take a look.

801
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,680
Got it.

802
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,870
Judging from the X-ray,

803
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,140
it's aortic regurgitation.

804
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,930
You can't wait

805
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,030
any longer.

806
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,210
Many problems will manifest as time pass.

807
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,520
Therefore, I suggest that

808
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,610
you undergo the surgery
as soon as possible.

809
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,410
I can't do that, doctor.

810
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,410
I'm really occupied at work.

811
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,770
I can't make it.

812
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,730
Let me be frank.

813
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,090
You will have to undergo the surgery
sooner or later.

814
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,530
It's better to do it early.

815
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,270
I think my body is doing fine.

816
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,600
It's okay.

817
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,080
Why are you here if everything is okay?

818
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,210
Why do you come to me if you're okay?

819
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,370
I'm busy.
Don't take up my time for nothing.

820
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,270
Doctor, don't be mad.

821
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,510
I'm not mad.

822
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,800
It's your body.

823
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,770
You should think for yourself.

824
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,450
I know. How about this?

825
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,650
Please prescribe some medicine for me.

826
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,740
I'll start with taking medicine.

827
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,700
What do you think?

828
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,460
Please do me a favour.

829
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,920
Thank you. Please do me a favour.

830
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,100
Don't stretch yourself thin.

831
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,050
If you are down with flu or diarrhoea,

832
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,520
you must seek medical help
soonest the possible.

833
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,170
Sure.

834
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,220
If your heart contracted a virus,

835
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,540
it would become a serious problem.

836
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,920
-Okay.
-Bear it in mind.

837
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,580
Okay.

838
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,040
Okay.

839
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,980
Thank you, doctor.

840
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,720
That's all for today. Come again tomorrow.

841
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,380
Dr Zhang, it's me.

842
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,180
It's you.

843
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,450
Yes.

844
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,050
Where is Xiao Jun?

845
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,850
Xiao Jun has gone to school.

846
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,850
I'm out for groceries shopping.

847
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,330
That's why I brought you

848
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,940
some steamed cakes which I just made.

849
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,780
Try it.

850
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,740
Great.

851
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,170
I was thinking
what I should have for lunch.

852
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,210
Thank you.

853
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,450
You're welcome.

854
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,940
I should be the one to thank you.

855
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,960
Xiao Jun recovered well after the surgery.

856
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:22,940
Therefore,

857
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,840
I'm here to thank you officially.

858
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,680
Don't do that.

859
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,020
What are you doing?
You don't have to do that.

860
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,920
Well...

861
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,800
I'll not take up your time.

862
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,120
Enjoy the food.

863
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,750
Sure, thank you.

864
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,600
I'm leaving.

865
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,580
-Goodbye.
-Sure.

866
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,370
Chen Meng Zhen.

867
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,200
My name is Zhang Yi Chi.

868
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,660
The next time we meet each other,

869
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,810
you may address me by my first name.

870
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,060
You're being so polite all the time.

871
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,250
You sound distant.

872
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,040
We're almost the same age.

873
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,720
The way you address me

874
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,070
makes me sound old.

875
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,660
Okay, I got it now.

876
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,460
-I'll go now.
-Goodbye.

877
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,050
Goodbye.
