00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,970
[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,480
[She has her own reason.]

5
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,890
[The medicine she replaced]

6
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,850
[did not cause major harm]

7
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,360
[to the person who took it.]

8
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,070
[It is not poisonous,]

9
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,480
[but it's not completely safe either.]

10
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,720
[The most important thing]

11
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,170
[is there's an overdose of adjuvant,]

12
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,040
[called Aristolochia.]

13
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,400
[Long-term use of this medicine]

14
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,840
[will increase the risk of liver cancer.]

15
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,400
[The inside of the tablet is porous,]

16
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,010
[it dissolves easily in water]

17
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,570
[and is convenient
for patients to swallow.]

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,760
[This is the characteristic
of a medicine produced by 3D printing.]

19
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,310
Medicine produced by 3D printing?

20
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,920
[In 12th grade,]

21
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,200
[there was a transfer student
in our school.]

22
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,840
[He was sitting beside me.]

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,450
[One day,]

24
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,279
[he disappeared from our school.]

25
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,070
[I couldn't find him anywhere.]

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,010
[All I could do]

27
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,279
[was reading all the detective novels
he gave to me.]

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,430
[I even hoped]

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,090
[that one day,]

30
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,170
[I'd see his name]

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,680
[on the cover of a detective novel,]

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,520
[Zhuo Ran.]

33
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,610
[He's neither a writer]

34
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,920
[nor a soldier now,]

35
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,360
[but running a 3D printing company.]

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,720
[He's a boss now.]

37
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,360
[Is this man from your hospital?]

38
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,410
[No.]

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,330
[Their company]

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,630
[set up a foundation ]

41
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:06,330
[called Public Interest Research Fund
in our hospital.]

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,350
[That day,]

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,320
[Xia Chu's friend wanted to interview me.]

44
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,610
[So she filmed some stuff.]

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,190
[I didn't know
that she'd use all the contents.]

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,390
[Xia Chu's friend?]

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,760
[Mi Gu?]

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,960
[Yes.]

49
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,990
We have an answer
regarding the medicine swap.

50
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,370
[There's a problem with the medicine,]

51
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,800
[but it is not fatal
in a short period of time.]

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,570
So right now,

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,560
we can't determine
the nature of this matter.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,210
I need you

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,560
to investigate someone for me.

56
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,310
Is it related to the medicine swap?

57
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,290
[Yes.]

58
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,170
Okay.

59
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,890
Send me his basic information.

60
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,860
Okay.

61
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,810
Brigade Commander,

62
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,530
this is the summary report
of the previous anti-flood rescue,

63
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,840
please have a look.

64
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,400
Leave it here.

65
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,000
This is an urgent task
the superior has just assigned.

66
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,150
Security at a medical conference?

67
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,350
Isn't the Public Security Bureau

68
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,080
in charge of security?

69
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,160
This is a special case.

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,210
It's related to the international
terrorist organization, T4

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,570
which you and Tian Yong

72
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,840
met in Isaia.

73
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,200
Attention!

74
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,170
Commandos Team Thunder is ordered
by the superior

75
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,570
to send elite personnel

76
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,880
to the hotel to facilitate their security.

77
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,400
Liang Mu Ze will be the captain.

78
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,520
With the anti-terrorism experience we have
over the years,

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,120
we will assist the police's deployment

80
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,590
by supplying technology and workforce,

81
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,200
to ensure the safety of the guests.

82
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,800
If you find
any suspicious situation or person,

83
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,520
you can take action

84
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,040
before reporting.

85
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,810
I'm Liang Mu Ze,
captain of Commandos Team Thunder,

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,320
Code name, Whale.

87
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm in charge

88
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,359
of the command and operations
in this operation.

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,590
Lieutenant of Thunder, Tian Yong
will assist the police

90
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,170
in monitoring the vehicles

91
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,440
entering and exiting
the hotel and parking areas.

92
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,010
Our team members, Xiao Teng
and Xiang Yang

93
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,840
will work with the security personnel

94
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,810
and watch the people

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,230
in the hotel.

96
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,560
All teams of Thunder 99
will stay at their current positions.

97
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,450
Two people will take lunch break
at a time.

98
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,760
Take turns
and eat in the in-house restaurant.

99
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,270
Mu Ze,

100
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,470
I've sent someone
to check with the front desk.

101
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,930
This man has booked a long-term stay

102
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,430
in a suite in this hotel.

103
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,690
Every week,

104
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,630
he'd stay here for three to four nights.

105
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,920
Is this the man you asked me

106
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,000
to investigate?

107
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes.

108
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,190
What a coincidence.

109
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,510
He's also here today.

110
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,120
If you're concerned about him,

111
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,280
we can go on the intranet

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,600
and look for his information again.

113
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,080
Okay.

114
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,880
[Zhuo Ran, where are you?]

115
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,570
[I'm at the door of the hotel,]

116
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,609
[I'll go through the security check
in a while.]

117
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,320
[Wait for me at the lobby.]

118
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,870
Sure.

119
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,640
Let's start.

120
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,660
Wen.

121
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,170
Qin, film the cars first.

122
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,129
Go to the banquet hall
and secure a good position for us.

123
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,280
Alright, got it.

124
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,150
Zhuo Ran!

125
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,130
You will be the press too for today,

126
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,360
but just an intern.

127
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll be learning from you.

128
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,510
Fox here,

129
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,090
target met someone

130
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,080
[and got a press pass.]

131
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,160
Copy that.

132
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,810
In the database,

133
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,710
there is not much information
about Zhuo Ran.

134
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,640
From what we found,

135
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,790
he appears to be

136
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,990
an average Vitalik businessman.

137
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,850
He studied industrial design in Germany.

138
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,890
After he graduated,

139
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,200
he started his own 3D printing company.

140
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,610
The headquarters

141
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,030
is also based in Vitalik.

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,230
Recently, he's expanded his business
in Chinese mainland.

143
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,370
Why would he need a press pass

144
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,310
for a summit meeting?

145
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,570
Judging from this,

146
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,710
he sure has some motive.

147
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,240
However,

148
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,570
he might share the same motive

149
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,430
with all the other businessmen,

150
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,970
that is to take this opportunity

151
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,330
to get more insights and information.

152
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,680
At the same time,

153
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,720
expanding his network and social circle.

154
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,000
What's wrong?

155
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,450
Xiao Xue has landed.

156
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,200
Don't worry. I've got it covered.

157
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,800
Okay.

158
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,290
Dad.

159
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,330
Cheeky girl,

160
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,960
why is it so noisy over there?

161
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,290
[I'm at the airport.]

162
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,890
[I'm picking someone up for my friend.]

163
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,320
You're at the airport?

164
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,670
I've just left the airport.

165
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,890
Was it Ningjiang Airport?

166
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,360
Yes,
I came to Ningjiang for a business trip.

167
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,650
Do you have time

168
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,640
to have dinner with me?

169
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,330
I'm afraid I can't.

170
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,010
I have to be on duty today.

171
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,640
On duty again?

172
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,520
Staying up late is bad for your health.

173
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,290
I'm fine. Don't worry.

174
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,650
How long will you be here?

175
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,850
Over a week.

176
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,810
I'm here for a conference

177
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,840
and giving speeches
at several partner universities.

178
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,230
So I'm not in a hurry.

179
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,410
Perhaps I could make time

180
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,760
and visit you in the hospital.

181
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,970
Sure.

182
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,690
Dad, I need to hang up.

183
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,290
The person I'm picking up
should come out anytime soon.

184
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,480
See you.

185
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,670
Alright.

186
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,310
Don't always stay up late,
drink more water.

187
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,480
[Got it. Bye-bye.]

188
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,200
Cheeky girl.

189
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,720
She's even busier than I am.

190
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,430
[Liang Shao Xue]

191
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,370
[Liang Shao Xue]

192
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,320
Liang Mu Ze,

193
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,440
has Liang Shao Xue contacted you?

194
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,450
[Liang Shao Xue]

195
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,450
Is this Liang Shao Xue?

196
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,790
Where are you?

197
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,280
What?

198
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,840
You know what?

199
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,850
I came in to clean this cubicle,

200
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,400
who knows
she's sleeping on the toilet seat.

201
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,090
She didn't even close the door.

202
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,250
She never reacted.

203
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,530
If you hadn't called,

204
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,440
I would've called the police.

205
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,710
Thank you.

206
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,040
However,

207
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,870
now I'm not sure

208
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,280
if she's the person
I'm supposed to pick up.

209
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,160
Aren't you picking up Liang Shao Xue?

210
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah.

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,670
She is Liang Shao Xue. Look.

212
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,990
This is unbelievable.

213
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,600
She's had work done, hasn't she?

214
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,710
Why are you staring at me?
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,470
Where is my cellphone?

216
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,120
It's here. Give me.

217
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,070
Thank you.

218
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,960
Are you Xia Chu?

219
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,120
What took you so long?
I've waited forever.

220
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,050
I'm the one who waited forever.

221
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,170
You fell asleep on the toilet seat.

222
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,130
Really?

223
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,840
Fine. I forgive you.

224
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,240
Hang on.

225
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you really

226
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,160
Liang Shao Xue?

227
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,200
Otherwise,
who would want to be this unlucky girl?

228
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,040
Don't get me wrong.

229
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,760
I just think

230
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,910
that you look different from the photo.

231
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,730
I'm afraid I might pick up
the wrong person,

232
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,520
so I need to confirm.

233
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,810
Don't worry, you're not wrong.

234
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,050
People grow up.

235
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,710
You donâ€™t look like the fertilized egg
you used to be now.

236
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,800
That's me.

237
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,750
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

238
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,170
Have a pleasant trip.

239
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,200
Sure.

240
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,730
Hi, I'm Liang Shao Xue.

241
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,360
It's the one
that Dr Letney asked me to adopt.

242
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,760
Its quarantine should have ended today,
right?

243
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,000
I have arrived in Ningjiang.

244
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,600
I can pick it up now.

245
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,090
What?

246
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,560
It's lost?

247
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,450
How could you lose such a big parrot?

248
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,600
Are you not
a professional pet care agency?

249
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,720
When did this happen?

250
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,050
Did you look for it?

251
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,230
Send more people to look for it!

252
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,290
Where is it now?

253
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,490
Hold on! Your luggage!

254
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,040
You guys are unreliable!

255
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,150
Your luggage!

256
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,720
Come back! Where are you going?

257
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,240
Come back!

258
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,150
Your luggage!

259
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,740
[Liang Shao Xue]

260
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,640
[The number you have dialled
is not available.]

261
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,720
[Braised Egg]

262
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,840
[Mr Zhang]

263
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,840
Mr Zhang.

264
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,070
Okay, I'll be right there.

265
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,850
Liang Shao Xue has left.

266
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,440
There's definitely
something wrong with her.

267
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,200
But I'm out of my mind as well.

268
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,650
I was on a night shift
and I haven't even slept a wink.

269
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,130
But I came to the airport
to pick up your sister.

270
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,930
Now I have to go back to the hospital.

271
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,720
Clean up the mess yourself.

272
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,160
Are you okay?

273
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,240
Okay, okay.

274
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,390
Call the police.

275
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,730
Okay, okay.

276
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:29,690
Okay, I'm fine.

277
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,559
Okay? I'm asking you to call the police.

278
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,630
My phone is dead,
you should make the call.

279
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,890
It's okay.
It was nothing, don't call the police.

280
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,330
Just go, miss. Go.

281
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,930
No way! My car is rented.

282
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,520
I must file a report with the police.

283
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,690
No.

284
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,490
What are you doing?

285
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,030
I told you to call the police!

286
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,250
No, miss.

287
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,570
You hit me,

288
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,050
you take full responsibility.

289
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,370
Why should I call the police?

290
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,450
I know I should take full responsibility,

291
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,570
but you still need to call the police.

292
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,520
This is the rule, do you know that?

293
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,030
Mr Policeman!

294
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,880
Where is he?

295
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,760
Jerk, stop the car!

296
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,840
Attention to all units.

297
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,250
[Five minutes later,]

298
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,030
[the cars will reach the hotel entrance.]

299
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,810
[After they get here,]

300
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,280
[all the guests will get off the car
one by one for photographs.]

301
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,920
[It takes about three minutes.]

302
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,830
[I'm ready.]

303
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,600
Why don't you go up first?

304
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,970
It's fine.

305
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,940
I'll wait for you.

306
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,440
Professor Xia is here.

307
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,630
You should know
that he's the father of Xia Chu, right?

308
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,880
I know.

309
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,640
He has entered the hall.

310
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,360
[Play it by ear.]

311
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,800
WIT120 is a new technology.

312
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,490
In this era,

313
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,200
this is a product which we were expecting.

314
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,370
Fox here,

315
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,280
the target
is staring at one of the guests.

316
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,570
Calling Fox.

317
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,930
Before the guest enters the halls,

318
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,200
follow the main target closely.

319
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,720
Roger.

320
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,870
Send the photo of target number one
to Koala.

321
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,050
[Calling Koala,]

322
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,840
[receive the photo of target number one.]

323
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,850
[Keep a close watch on him.]

324
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,120
Copy that.

325
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,580
That's him.

326
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,290
That's a VIP lane.

327
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,630
The press lane is over here.

328
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,920
Let's go, then.

329
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,370
Yes.

330
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm at the door of the hotel now.

331
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,200
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

332
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,190
Back off. You can't enter without a pass.

333
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,080
What's going on?

334
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,400
What is she doing here?

335
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,040
Gopher, Gopher.

336
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,090
Bring me the girl in the parking lot

337
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,920
to the command room.

338
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,070
Copy that.

339
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,610
Don't move!

340
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,600
[Right now,]

341
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,930
[an unprecedented profound change]

342
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,390
[is taking place in this world.]

343
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,030
[I am a professor at a university,]

344
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,250
[at the same time,]

345
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,760
[I am also]

[I know]

348

[I am responsible
for meeting new challenges]

[and encouraging mankind]

350
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,200
[to take the next giant leap.]

[In the next two days,]

352

[we will]

353

[carry out a multi-disciplinary
and effective conference]

[which covers medical and health,
education and finance,]

[and also other fields.]

356
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,310
[I believe
that the discussion between experts]

357
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,800
[will give us a broader vision
and a clearer understanding]

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,170
[of the development pattern]

359
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,520
[of the entire world.]

360

Stand right there!

361
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,980
Are you alright?

362
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,030
-Watch her.
-Yes!

363
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,360
Go over there to stop him!

364

He's so cool.

365

[A lone armed man.]

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,150
[go inside the hotel
and wait for my order.]

374
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,690
[All the other units,]

375
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,600
[block all passages including
the basement,]

376
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,110
[ensure the safety of the conference.]

377
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,610
[Attention to Team Thunder,]

378
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,840
this is a Code Red situation.

379
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,400
[Koala, keep an eye on the conference.]

380
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,240
[Fox, watch target number one closely.]

381
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,450
[I hereby]

382
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,960
[propose]

383
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,990
[for a toast together,]

384
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,570
[for the success of the summit,]

385
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,000
[and also the well-being
of you and your family.]

386
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,650
[Cheers.]

387
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,790
Cheers!

388
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,190
Professor Xia is quite a visionary.

389
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,690
Are you still interested

390
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,090
in attending such forums in the future?

391
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,080
Sure. Thank you.

392
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,760
Gopher, please answer.

393
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,120
Gopher, Gopher, answer if you hear me.

394
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,130
Professor Xia,

395
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,650
regarding the progress
of new tranquillisers...

396
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,490
Sorry,

397
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,560
Professor Xia needs some rest.

398
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,610
Sorry, sorry.

399
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,580
Please make room.

400
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,170
Professor Xia.

401
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,880
Congratulations. Here's to you.

402
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,380
Thank you.

403
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,920
Professor,

404
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,640
Mi Gu,

405
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,880
she's Xia Chu's best friend.

406
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,130
She'd like to interview you.

407
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,040
Do you have time?

408
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,650
Sure, sure.

409
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,910
-I'll call her over here.
-Okay.

410
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,200
Mi Gu.

411
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,920
I'll go over there.

412
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,280
Okay.

413
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,450
Uncle Xia, nice to meet you.

414
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,640
I am Mi Gu.

415
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,080
Nice to meet you.

416
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,200
Fox's here.

417
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,410
I suspect target number one

418
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,920
is hiding something in his pocket.

419
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,600
Calling Whale.

420
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,640
We've tied down the target.

421
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,560
Preliminary assessment suggests

422
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,200
a drug deal.

423
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,990
Copy that.

424
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,560
[As for the girl,]

425
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,470
[we've got her under control.]

426
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,110
[I'll take her to you
after she comes round.]

427
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,520
Copy that.

428
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,040
Thank you.

429
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,470
Xiao Xue is fine.

430
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,520
[Gopher, the driver committed suicide
by taking poison.]

431
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,870
I'll be right there.

432
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,160
Watch him.

433
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,560
Gopher's here.

434
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,960
[The driver committed suicide
by taking poison.]

435
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,400
Rescue him immediately.

436
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,400
I won't let him die so easily.

437
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,210
Should we terminate the conference

438
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,440
and evacuate the crowd?

439
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,560
As I see it,

440
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,930
the drug dealer wanted
to slip through the cracks

441
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,160
and sneak in under our nose.

442
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,190
Don't terminate the conference first.

443
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,120
Xia Chu always talked about you.

444
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,640
Thank you for taking care of her.

445
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,830
No, we're just helping each other out.

446
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,120
I appreciate it.

447
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,610
Uncle Xia,

448
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,610
I would like

449
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,210
to conduct an exclusive interview with you
on this forum.

450
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,430
Is it convenient for you?

451
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,800
No problem.

452
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,480
It's noisy in here, isn't it?

453
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,240
Let's talk over there.

454
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,600
Wen.

455
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,490
That cheeky girl,

456
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,360
I can hardly see her these days.

457
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,000
Xia Chu got her good qualities from...

458
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,610
Why?

459
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,000
Why do you never talk to me?

460
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,400
Go to hell!

461
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,600
Professor Xia!

462
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,220
You toy boy!

463
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,720
Put down the knife!

464
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,960
Li Lei, Li Lei,

465
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,930
there's an attack on the corridor

466
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,770
outside the banquet hall,

467
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,120
bring some men and check on it.

468
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,510
[Copy that, Rao Zhi.]

469
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,050
Something is wrong with this man.

470
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,230
I'll go check on him.

471
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,140
Are you okay?

472
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,839
Professor, easy.

473
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,919
Uncle Xia.

474
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,680
[I'll kill all of you!]

475
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,160
What's going on over there?

476
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,070
The target has escaped. Execute Plan B.

477
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,240
Got it.

478
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,490
I'm just a waiter,

479
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,879
you can't sue me!

480
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,990
Who are you?

481
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,189
You can't sue me!

482
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,370
Ren hasn't texted me yet,

483
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,879
the deal has probably failed.

484
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,560
Drive the car to the meeting point,

485
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:55,870
I'm coming down.

486
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,840
Hi,

487
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,860
please hold on.

488
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,810
There's a sniper.

489
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,280
Inside a high-rise building
on the west side of the hotel,

490
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,850
about ten stories high. Go get him.

491
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,030
[Copy that.]

492
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,810
Attention to all units.

493
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,690
Target number four
is in a black Chevrolet,

494
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,890
license plate number unknown.

495
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,760
Located on the south of the hotel,
heading towards the east.

496
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,160
Whale, the target has escaped.

497
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,130
Captain.

498
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:11,970
Where is Rao Zhi?

499
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,930
He's inside.

500
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,110
It's none of your business!
Just leave me alone!

501
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,420
Rao Zhi.

502
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,110
Send her home for me.

503
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,550
Yes.

504
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,530
What about you?

505
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,650
The conference hasn't ended.

506
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,360
There is still a lot of work to be done.

507
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,520
Rao Zhi,

508
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,400
I've gone through
the hotel's surveillance cameras,

509
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,480
I still

510
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,730
find Zhuo Ran suspicious.

511
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,240
He had been following the man.

512
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,880
It was the man I fought with.

513
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,320
Plus the sniper opposite the hotel,

514
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,320
I think it is not as simple as it seems.

515
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,840
I knew these.

516
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,090
I've sent someone

517
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,480
to find out Zhuo Ran's real intention.

518
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,330
As to Xiao Xue...

519
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,090
I'll take care of her.

520
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,060
It'll be fine.

521
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,520
Thanks.

522
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,520
I'll check it out.

523
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,870
How dare he throw my phone?

524
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,120
How dare he!

525
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,560
You should be glad
that he didn't throw you out.

526
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,400
Tyrant.

527
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,770
You almost ruined their whole plan,

528
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,370
you know?

529
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:23,880
So what?

530
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,520
What's so great about solving a case?

531
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,250
He kept asking me

532
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,090
why I came to this hotel,

533
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,640
or if I knew that driver.

534
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,930
I'm like a disaster to him
after I came back.

535
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,610
You couldn't find the suspect,

536
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,970
so it's my fault now, isn't it?

537
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,890
This is not what he meant.

538
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,480
This is exactly what he meant!

539
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,080
I lost my best friend!

540
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,800
That jerk almost ran over me,

541
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,640
but I still have to compensate
that car dealer.

542
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm the most unlucky one!

543
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,200
But you still interrogate me like that.

544
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,480
I'm already unlucky enough, Mu Ze.

545
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,480
How could you do this to me?

546
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,200
If you

547
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,440
want him to care more about you,

548
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,480
you should do something else.

549
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,920
Yelling is useless.

550
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,600
There's nothing else I can do.

551
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,630
He's a robot.

552
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,200
That robot is your father.

553
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,850
He is not my father!

554
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,600
He's a complete stranger!

555
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,170
He's not my father!

556
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,730
He's not my father!

557
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,600
He's a stranger!

558
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,550
No, he is not!

559
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,540
Are you done?

560
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,910
No.

561
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,440
I'm taking a break.

562
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,690
I'm done.

563
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,480
Did you say you lost your best friend?

564
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,760
Do I know him?

565
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,480
Of course you don't.

566
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,920
It is an animal therapist

567
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,240
introduced to me
by my friend who is a doctor.

568
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,470
We've been together for a few years.

569
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,160
I asked them to deliver it here,

570
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,010
but the agency lost it

571
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,560
before it even left
the quarantine centre.

572
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,480
Animal therapist?

573
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,530
Just adopt another one.

574
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,400
I can't adopt another one!

575
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,000
It is my one and only!

576
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,490
Do you even know what is one and only?

577
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm sure you don't know.

578
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,340
In that case,

579
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,000
regarding the compensation
for your rental car,

580
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,080
take care of it yourself.

581
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,880
Mu Ze.

582
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,040
I have my phone here.

583
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,720
Either Wechat or Alipay is fine.

584
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,830
That'll be 2,300 yuan.

585
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,840
Thank you, Mu Ze.

586
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,870
We can also go home and get the cash.

587
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,450
Tian Yong.

588
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,420
Yes!

589
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,370
Here's a task for you.

590
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,210
Yes.

591
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,370
Send her to my house.

592
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,930
You were that guy who flung me

593
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,390
in the basement parking, weren't you?

594
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,580
Yes.

595
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,080
I'll remember you.

596
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,440
It's too risky. I'll take her home.

597
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,800
Thank you, captain.

598
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,960
Attention to all units,

599
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,160
this is Whale.

600
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,610
Gopher will be in charge of site command.

601
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,760
Over.

602
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,800
I will complete the mission!

603
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,960
I'll leave now.

604
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,650
Captain,

605
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,890
-Zhuo Ran has been taken
-He's the captain now.

606
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,200
by the police...

607
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,960
Not bad, lieutenant.

608
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,800
When did you take over his position?

609
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,590
What are you staring at?

610
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,430
This girl is dangerous.

611
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,270
Slow down.

612
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,600
Dad!

613
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,400
Dad.

614
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,760
Tang Lin called me and said
you were injured.

615
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,690
How are you? Is it serious?

616
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,080
I'm fine.

617
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,090
I hurt my back.

618
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,280
It's nothing major.

619
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,460
Is it true?

620
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,950
It is.

621
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,530
It's true.

622
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,030
After that, Mr Zhuo...

623
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,670
Mr Zhuo?
