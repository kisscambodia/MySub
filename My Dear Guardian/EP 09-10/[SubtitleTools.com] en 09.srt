[My Dear Guardian]

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,320
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,080
Did you lose anything?

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,560
No, I didn't lose anything.

6
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,220
Rao Zhi.

7
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,520
Nothing suspicious is detected.

8
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,160
You guys are neglecting
what is right under your nose.

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,800
Could it be that before you left,

10
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,370
you opened the window
but you forgot about it?

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,770
Could it someone else in the house
have opened the window

12
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,920
but didn't inform you?

13
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,280
There's no way I could've forgotten
that I opened the window.

14
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,640
I'm not sure

15
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,450
if anyone else opened the window.

16
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,650
I think it's better to be cautious.

17
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,530
Please investigate for me, Mr Rao.

18
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,300
How about this?

19
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,490
I'll get someone to check the surveillance
of the surrounding streets.

20
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,720
I'll contact you if anything.

21
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,790
Sure.

22
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,200
Let's go back.

23
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,940
It's my...

24
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,160
Stop moving. Sit down and watch.

25
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,480
It's Er Miao.

26
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,440
Did it lose weight?

27
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,770
Do you have any other videos?

28
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,530
No.

29
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,760
That's the only video.

30
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,640
Please send it to me.

31
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,990
Xia Chu.

32
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,930
When you left home,

33
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,760
did you open the window
in the master room?

34
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,370
I can't remember.

35
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,640
Did I? I don't think so.

36
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,020
What's wrong?

37
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,260
Nothing.

38
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,140
It's my darling Er Miao.

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,160
I really miss it.

40
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,170
-You call it Er...
-Miao.

41
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,480
Why are you laughing?

42
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,670
Nothing.

43
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,520
Where are you going?

44
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm going to get changed and wash my hair.

45
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,410
Don't be dramatic.

46
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,240
You can barely stand.
How do you wash your hair?

47
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,600
My hair stinks!

48
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,160
Do you want to recover soon?

49
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,440
Of course, but I have to wash my hair.

50
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,200
Why don't...

51
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,250
you lend me a hand?

52
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,479
Do you expect me
to wait on you like a servant?

53
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,000
Isn't a soldier meant to serve the people?

54
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,260
Dream on!

55
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:47,520
♫ Romance makes little things feel warm ♫

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:57,290
♫ Warmth softens even a stubborn heart ♫

57
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,900
♫ Heart is filled
with your little company everyday ♫

58
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,410
Slow down!

59
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,000
The water is going into my ears!

60
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,130
It's burning!

61
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,240
It's burning!

62
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,450
You're so troublesome.

63
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,210
Why don't you do it on your own?

64
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,570
I forgot that

66
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,560
this is Captain Liang's place.

67
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,000
If I won't stop talking,

68
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,520
I'll be chased out of the place.

69
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,890
What are you doing?

70
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm going to get a towel.

71
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,060
Don't move. Let me get it for you.

72
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,520
I can do it.

73
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,330
Let me do it.

74
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,040
Don't move.

76
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,520
There's a piece of hair on your face.

77
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,359
What's wrong with you?

78
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,090
I enjoy having a strand of hair

79
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,370
sticking on my face.

80
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,600
It's none of your business!

81
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,320
Stop moving. It's to reduce the swelling.

82
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,680
My mum is calling.

83
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,770
What does it have to do with me?

84
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:02,080
Of course it has something to do with you.

85
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,640
Have you forgotten that
you're my girlfriend?

86
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,690
Mum.

87
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,650
Son.

88
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,600
Why didn't you reply to
my text messages on WeChat?

89
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,610
I just came back to the camp yesterday.

90
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,720
I've been busy at work.

91
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,040
What are you doing?

92
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,810
Xia Chu injured herself.

93
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,570
Xia Chu?

94
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,180
She's moved out, hasn't she?

95
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,560
She didn't move out. She decided to stay.

96
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,040
I brought her back to the military camp.

97
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,840
I have to take care of her.

98
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,240
Why would I lie to you? She's here.

99
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,650
I'll let her talk to you.

100
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,420
Hello.

101
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,000
Hello, Xia Chu.

102
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,130
It's me.

103
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,609
I heard

104
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,210
from Mu Ze that you injured yourself.

105
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,640
What happened?

106
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,090
It's nothing.

107
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,050
I injured my ankle.

108
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,440
I feel so much better today.

109
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,850
You must rest well.

110
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,300
Don't worry.

111
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,050
I'll take care of myself.

112
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,320
Does Liang Mu Ze treat you well?

113
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,680
Liang Mu Ze...

114
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,920
He...

115
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,610
treats me quite well.

116
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,770
Good to hear that.

117
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,730
When I'm free, I'll pay you a visit.

118
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,460
Sure. Please take care.

119
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,720
That's all for now.

120
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,860
Mum.

121
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,970
Are you at ease now?

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,730
Moving forward, stop sending

123
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,660
ridiculous photos to the camp.

124
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,330
I have to go. Bye.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,320
Good acting.

126
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,640
As long as you're happy.

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,280
Otherwise, you will chase me out again.

128
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,660
Xia Chu.

129
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,620
What?

130
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,600
I have apologised to you, haven't I?

131
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,330
Put it on until the swelling is gone.

132
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,410
Listen.

133
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,320
Starting from next week,

134
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,050
it will rain every day.

135
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,040
Don't go anywhere.

136
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,090
If you're bored

137
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,640
and intrigued to check out
our training process,

138
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,600
you may use this.

139
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,020
No one wants to see it.

140
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,520
All right, take a nap
after you blow dry your hair.

141
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,580
Don't get a cold.

142
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,480
Health documentary?

143
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,400
It sounds great.

144
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,780
Now,

145
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,600
the relationship between doctors
and patients has become strained.

146
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,170
We can provide them a channel

147
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,410
so that they can understand
each other better.

148
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,090
I think it's quite meaningful.

149
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,060
I support the idea.

150
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,770
However, in order to execute the idea,

151
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,840
we need to get approval

152
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,770
from the management department
of the hospital.

153
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,820
How about this?

154
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,120
You should come out
with a specific proposal.

155
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,850
Let me deal with

156
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,930
the hospital.

157
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,570
I think it shouldn't be a problem.

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,800
It helps with digestion.

159
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,820
Thank you.

160
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,880
What is bothering you?

161
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,260
Dr Zhang.

162
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,480
I would like to
ask an irrelevant question.

163
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,040
What is it?

164
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,960
Is Zhuo Ran terminally ill?

165
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,160
How should I put it?

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,480
When the disease is under control,

167
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,960
he can live like a normal person.

168
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,520
Once the disease is at its onset,

169
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,280
it can be dangerous.

170
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,680
Is there any way to cure it?

171
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,920
Reduce his stress reaction.

172
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,560
For example,

173
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,440
who called him the other day?

174
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,400
What was the conversation about?

175
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,160
Try to avoid the same
from happening again.

176
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,320
It's quite impossible

177
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,050
to cure it once and for all.

178
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,420
What's wrong?

179
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,210
Something urgent came up.

180
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,200
Now?

181
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm sorry, Dr Zhang.

182
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you want to add on?

183
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,490
No need, I can't finish everything.

184
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm so sorry. I'll pay for the bill.

185
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,240
No need.

186
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,040
Hello, sir.

187
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,130
Since your friend has left,

188
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
we purposely bring you

189
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,210
a toy bear.

190
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,800
Can we place it here?

191
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,920
You're being so considerate.

192
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,250
Thank you.

193
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,480
Sure, enjoy the food.

194
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,580
Sure.

195
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,760
Let's finish the meal

196
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,410
together.

197
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,080
Zhuo Ran.

198
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,820
Mi Gu?

199
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,760
Why are you here?

200
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,490
I'm here to check on you.

201
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,370
You were discharged
from the hospital so suddenly.

202
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,650
I couldn't reach you.

203
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,650
I'm a little worried.

204
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,960
How do you feel?

205
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,450
Have you recovered?

206
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,840
I've recovered.

207
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,460
Good to hear that.

208
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,540
Since you're ill,

209
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,080
you have to rest well.

210
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,010
Take good care of yourself.

211
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm leaving.

212
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,020
Mi Gu.

213
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,920
Thank you for checking on me.

214
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,240
What on earth were you doing?

215
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,740
We almost got caught!

216
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,440
Why were you dilly-dallying?

217
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,930
Nothing happened, right?

218
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,010
Why are you scared?

219
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,680
Why am I scared?

220
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,690
We've been in China for so long.

221
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,180
You've been running around after Xia Chu.

222
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,500
I thought you're something

223
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,960
but we haven't even seen
her dad for once.

224
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm talking to you!

225
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,810
Why did you go to his house

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,010
and install bugs?

227
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,330
Are you crazy?

228
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,210
Do you really think that
by wearing earphones all the time,

229
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,700
you can accomplish the mission

230
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,330
assigned to us by Old Master?

231
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,170
I know what I am doing.

232
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,640
Like hell you do!

233
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,520
Listen, don't put me in trouble.

234
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,410
I'll report everything that happened today

235
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,730
to Old Master.

236
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,240
You'll have to
bear the consequences alone.

237
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,930
Based on the analysis
of a jewellery expert,

238
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,730
the sapphire

239
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,010
on the deceased's walking stick

240
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,420
is the Cornflower Blue Sapphire

241
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,040
originated from Kashmir.

242
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,570
The mining activities

243
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,090
only went on for 28 years.

244
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,890
Therefore,

245
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,170
Kashmir Sapphires
that are available in the world

246
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,160
are really rare.

247
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,580
The last time

248
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,320
this sapphire appeared in public

249
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,130
was two years ago, at the world renowned

[Gem info: Cornflower Blue Sapphire
originated from Kashmir]

251
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,120
Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong.

252
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,490
A China Mainland merchant

253
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,810
by the name Liu Zheng Ming

254
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,050
won the bid

255
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,160
with 9,210,000 HKD.

256
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,480
Liu Zheng Ming

257
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,520
is the sugar-daddy
of the deceased, Zhou Lan

258
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,780
who killed herself
in the Jiao Tong University district.

259
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,160
His nickname is Xiong.

260
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,530
How much do we know about him?

261
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,330
In the early nineties,

262
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,850
he started off his business
by smuggling imported cigarettes.

263
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,520
He was arrested and sentenced
to prison for seven years.

264
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,140
After he's released,

265
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,020
he ventured into Chinese
herbal medicine business.

266
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,610
Now, he's dominated
the herbal medicine market

267
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,920
in the five provinces of Southeast China.

268
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,080
He also has business
in Thailand, Vietnam and so on.

269
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,580
[Gem info: Cornflower Blue Sapphire
originated from Kashmir]

270
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,410
Besides the sapphire

271
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,570
which was recorded two years ago,

272
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,940
we don't have any other records

273
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,780
about his gem collection.

274
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,440
It appears that
he is not a major gem collector.

275
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,810
As for how and why the sapphire

276
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,250
fell into the male deceased's hand,

277
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,160
we don't have any clue as for now.

278
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,760
A Chinese medicine merchant

279
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,040
is involved in two murders simultaneously.

280
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,170
It's not a coincidence for sure.

281
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,770
Judging from the situation,

282
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,160
to find out the identity
of the male deceased in the bungalow,

283
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,020
the breakthrough

284
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,360
is Xiong.

285
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,840
Put up with it.

286
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,360
Slow down.

287
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,940
All right.

288
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,080
you may move around.

289
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,930
That's great!

290
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,450
You're recovering fast.

291
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,930
Like I said,
I can remove the cast on my own.

292
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,320
But you insisted on coming here.

293
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,000
I have to do so.

294
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm entrusted by someone.

295
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,240
Please thank
Brigade Commander Dong for me.

296
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,770
Brigade Commander didn't send me here.

297
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,200
It's been raining for a week.

298
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,040
It's not going to stop any sooner.

299
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,680
Yes, it'll rain non stop.

300
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,610
Therefore, every year, at this period,

301
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,840
we'll get ready for war.

302
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,880
Did you receive a new mission?

303
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,730
As the Buddha said, it's a secret.

304
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,280
All right, I have to go.

305
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,400
How about this?

306
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,520
I'll leave some medicine for you.

307
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,840
If I have to go on a mission,

308
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,720
you can apply the medicine
on your own.

309
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay, thank you.

310
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm leaving.

311
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,200
Is the entire Special Forces Brigade

312
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,650
getting ready for war?

313
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,580
Yes, we're preparing for war.

314
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,200
Team Lightning is getting ready too.

315
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,880
Captain Liang is included.

316
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm leaving.

317
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,660
Brigade Commander!

318
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,520
I propose to pass through
the highland side.

319
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,050
It's pouring. I worry that
we might get struck by lightning.

320
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,610
What if we run into a mudslide?

321
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,410
We go through field battle training
on a daily basis.

322
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,520
It's okay.

323
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,440
No doubt it's safer
but how about the speed?

324
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,560
You might be okay with the route

325
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,640
but can the other units catch up with you?

326
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,510
Let's go!

327
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,920
Attention.

328
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,569
Speed up!

329
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,360
Let's take the lead

330
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,200
to pave the way for the other units.

331
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,250
Make sure all of you
take safeguard measures along the way.

332
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,930
Make sure all the units pass safely.

333
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,279
Reply if you receive my message.

334
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,920
Noted!

335
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,160
Noted!

336
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,640
Hurry up. Stay safe. Hurry!

337
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,440
This is Team Lightning speaking.

338
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,480
Attention, all units.
Speed up and stay safe!

339
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,920
Before five o'clock,

340
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,200
all of you must reach the assembly point!

341
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,400
Go!

342
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,240
Be safe.

343
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,170
-Squad leader.
-Liang.

344
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,020
Are the stewed ribs ready?

345
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,780
It's ready.

346
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,000
As per the Brigade Commander's
instruction,

347
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,050
it's braised on low heat.

348
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,610
Take a sniff.

349
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,000
-It smells good.
-It smells good.

350
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,520
-It smells good, right?
-Yes.

351
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,050
I'll take it with me.

352
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,040
Slow down. Don't burn yourself.

353
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,130
I haven't added salt in it.

354
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,100
It's okay. It's good.

355
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,740
It's all right.

356
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,490
-Slow down.
-I'm leaving.

357
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,890
-Don't burn yourself.
-Thank you.

358
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,000
Great. Slow down.

359
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,880
Let me check on

360
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,200
my saviour.

361
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,840
Are you okay?

362
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,200
You're so cool, Liang Mu Ze.

363
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,840
Of course.

364
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,120
Let's get ready for dinner.

365
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,680
Yes!

366
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,530
Our captain

367
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,200
is really something.

368
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,400
Listen, besides catching you,

369
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,580
he's also good at other things.

370
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,960
Not only is he good at diving,
parachuting, rock climbing, and skiing,

371
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,890
he's also good at close quarters combat
and emergency rescue communication.

372
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,370
He can speak three languages
and handle all kinds of vehicles.

373
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,920
He's the top soldier in the army.

374
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,060
He can do things that others cannot.

375
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,120
For example,

376
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,010
metamorphosing and lip reading.

377
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,320
No one in the army is his match.

378
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,010
Nobody can better him.

379
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,250
In that aspect,

380
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,380
he's definitely the best.

381
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,480
Are you writing a novel?

382
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,480
You're even more interesting
than a novel.

383
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,120
I didn't know that you can read lips.

384
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,000
Just a bit.

385
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,770
Anyone can mistake us for a couple

386
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,280
except for you.

387
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,360
For a long time,

388
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,130
I couldn't even stand it
when someone mentioned

389
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,240
the phrase, "special forces soldier."

390
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,960
Let alone start dating again.

391
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,650
Can you teach me?

392
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,620
No.

393
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,570
Dr Xia.

394
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,760
There's a long way to go.

395
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,730
There's a long way to go.

396
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,960
Finish the soup.

397
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,930
Yes.

398
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,860
You too.
Finish it while it's still warm.

399
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,750
-It's quite flavourful.
-It's so bland.

400
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,450
It's so delicious, captain.

401
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,680
I've never had such delicious soup,

402
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,670
captain.

403
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,030
Well done.

404
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,190
I was being impatient.

405
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,590
Why did you bring out the case?

406
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,390
I'm leaving tomorrow.

407
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,110
My leg has recovered.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

408
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,430
Has it been a week?

409
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,750
Yes.

410
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,910
Are you sure you've recovered?

411
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,290
Yes.

412
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,290
Report!

413
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,990
Captain, I suddenly recall

414
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,830
I have to attend to something urgent.
I have to go.

415
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,310
Don't leave yet.
You haven't finished eating.

416
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,200
Dr Xia, it's quite urgent.

417
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,320
I have to leave now.

418
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,950
Continue eating.
You don't have to send me off.

419
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,510
I'm leaving, captain.

420
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,830
Continue eating.

421
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,040
Is Lieutenant Tian

422
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,040
trying to make space

423
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,310
for us to spend time alone?

424
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,350
Thank you for taking care of me
for the past few days.

425
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,920
I'll replace wine with soup.

426
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,020
Cheers!

427
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,670
That's all?

428
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,510
Don't you have anything else to say?

429
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,910
Like what?

430
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,970
You bought a bouquet in my name

431
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,070
and you haven't apologised to me.

432
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,230
Well,

433
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,760
I was being nosy.

434
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,150
However, I still don't get it.

435
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,070
Why did you get so angry?

436
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,550
Just because Xiao Jun's mum
doesn't like flowers?

437
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,120
She likes flowers.

438
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,510
However, it has nothing to do with me.

439
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,350
Both of you...

440
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,710
It's been so many years.

441
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,110
You've been taking care of them.

442
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,870
So what?

443
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,150
Does it have to involve a love affair?

444
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,520
Do I have to date her

445
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,620
and marry her?

446
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,470
What if I'm taking care of them

447
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,910
as Luo Liang's comrade?

448
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,430
I'm just pretending to be Xiao Jun's dad.

449
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,910
I'll take care of them and protect them

450
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,530
until Xiao Jun grows up,

451
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,030
until he's grown into
an independent adult,

452
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,190
until they don't need
my protection anymore,

453
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,710
until he can protect his own mum.

454
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,780
Is that not allowed?

455
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,550
I'm not avoiding it.

456
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,000
It's to the contrary.

457
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,380
I'm facing it.

458
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,630
I got it now.

459
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,060
Liang Mu Ze.

460
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,670
I didn't mean to

461
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,670
embarrass you on purpose.

462
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,950
Firstly,

463
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,070
as Xiao Jun's doctor in charge,

464
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,320
I don't want him to get
emotionally agitated.

465
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,990
It will affect his recovery.

466
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,140
More importantly,

467
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,510
I don't want you two to let
each other slip by.

468
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,540
I know the feeling.

469
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,730
I mean,

470
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,670
letting each other slip by
when the feeling is mutual.

471
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:07,960
It's

472
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,100
quite disheartening.

473
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,440
Therefore, I promised Xiao Jun

474
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,990
to buy a bouquet in your name.

475
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,440
However, I didn't expect

476
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,310
it would bother you that much.

477
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,990
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,270
I was full of myself.

479
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,230
That's why I misunderstood you two.

480
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,510
Have you experienced it?

481
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,470
Pick up the call.

482
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,400
Pick up the call.

483
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,430
Pick up the call.

484
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,030
I think so.

485
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,990
How about you, Liang Mu Ze?

486
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,590
Have you ever let anyone slip by?

487
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,350
Do you feel regret?

488
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,150
No.

489
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,150
I never let anything slip by.

490
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,670
That's why I don't have any regrets.

491
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,120
Eat up.

492
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,350
Have some pork ribs.

493
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,950
You are what you eat.

494
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,870
Listen.

495
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,830
I...

496
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,990
In that situation,

497
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,880
I felt as if

498
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,870
there was a huge bulb on my head.

499
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,480
Did you feel awkward?

500
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,890
It's so awkward.

501
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,720
Lieutenant Tian.

502
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,360
What is the relationship between

503
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,550
Captain Liang and Dr Xia?

504
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,630
What do you think?

505
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,480
If they are really a couple,

506
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,210
she seemed upset

507
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,590
when we called her Mrs Liang.

508
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,290
If there is nothing between them,

509
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,240
why did Captain Liang

510
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,610
bring her back to camp?

511
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,070
She stayed here for so many days.

512
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,690
Xiang Yang.

513
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,150
"The west is veiled in rain
while the east enjoys sunshine."

514
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,710
"My gallant is as deep in love
as the day is fine."

515
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,560
Xia Chu.

516
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,750
My mum wants to see our photo.

517
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,240
What are you doing?

518
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,250
Give it to me!

519
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,280
It's not going to work!

520
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,640
You promised me before.

521
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,040
No doubt I promised you before

522
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,010
but...

523
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,390
Look, this photo is so ugly.

524
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,160
You took the photo from the bottom.

525
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,480
That's the most tricky angle.

526
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,880
Furthermore,
my face looks huge in the photo.

527
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,640
It's also taken against the light!

528
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,240
I look at least three shades darker.

529
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,400
Captain Liang, look at yourself.

530
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,550
Would you smile?
What kind of expression is that?

531
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,240
We are so far apart.

532
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,080
We don't look like

533
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,320
a couple who are crazily in love.

534
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:09,930
If you send the photo

535
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,130
to your mum,

536
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,470
she won't believe in us.

537
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,830
What should we do?

538
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,910
Let me teach you a lesson, Captain Liang.

539
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,280
Liang Mu Ze, come forward.

540
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,190
My face looks huge. Hurry up.

541
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,310
One, two, three, cheese!

542
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,790
Captain Liang, can you put on a smile?

543
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,800
Stay still, don't move.

544
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,190
One, two...

545
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,780
Close your eyes and enjoy life.

546
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,920
This is not okay.

547
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,680
I look silly in this photo.

548
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,480
Be happy, okay?

549
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,290
You look happy.

550
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,070
My mum will think that I've gone crazy
if she sees this.

551
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,150
Do I look crazy?

552
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,210
Taking a photo is so tiring.

553
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,030
It's even more tiring
than going for training.

554
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,230
It's not that tiring.

555
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,870
Since we're pretending,

556
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,150
we have to put in more effort
to look real.

557
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,470
All right, it's done.

558
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,750
Send it to your mum.

559

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:09,060
♫ Warmth softens even a stubborn heart ♫

561
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,870
We look so real
even though we're pretending.

562
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:19,540
♫ Heart is filled
with your little company everyday ♫

563
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,510
What if it becomes true?

564
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,590
It's none of my business.

565
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:29,610
♫ Can't miss a thing about you,
hence there is no regrets ♫

566
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,320
♫ Getting used to your habits
from breakfast to dinner ♫

567
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,360
Do you really enjoy
working in the hospital?

568
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,330
Of course.

569
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,010
Just wait.

570
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,930
I'm so busy with training.

571
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,930
We need to get ready for war too.

572
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,390
I don't have the time to fetch you.

573
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,510
I have legs.

574
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,860
You mean, your broken leg?

575
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,390
I'm a military officer too!

576
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,880
I won't fall behind
even when I lose my flesh and skin.

577
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,670
I'm not as fragile as you think.

578
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,130
Here, let me show you something.

579
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,470
Come here.

580
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,030
See for yourself.

581
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,750
It's pouring.

582
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,700
It's difficult to travel.
How do you plan to go back?

583
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,950
I...

584
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,320
I can drive.

585
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,470
I have a driving licence.

586
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,350
Drive?

587
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,350
What are you doing?

588
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,950
How do you drive?

589
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,750
It's for the sake of your safety.

590
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,340
Be good, Da Miao.

591
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,650
Good girl.

592
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,560
Liang Mu Ze!

593
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,920
If you ever pinch my face again,

594
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,800
I'll chop the 27 bones in your hand

595
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,510
into pieces!

596
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,590
Brigade Commander.

597
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,070
Yes, I'm Liang Mu Ze.

598
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,630
I would like to get your permission
on something.

599
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,710
I'm coming. Stop knocking the door.

600
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,960
Change into the military uniform.
Ten minutes later,

601
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,200
go to the assembly point.

602
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,230
Why?

603
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,430
One, two, three, four.

604
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,750
What's wrong?

605
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,550
You have to run.

606
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,830
What?

607
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,200
Either you run

608
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,870
or you train with them.

609
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,550
Me?

610
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,520
Yes.

611
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,240
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

612
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,320
Hurry up. Do it.

613
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,470
Why?

614
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,110
It's for your own good.

615
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,450
You're not my leader.

616
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,750
Why should I listen to you?

617
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,650
Brigade Commander said
it's just a minor accident

618
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,920
but you injured your leg.

619
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,630
That means you lack training.

620
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,810
Hence, he applied to your superior

621
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,660
to include you in the training
as a non-staff.

622
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,710
What?

623
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,550
It's to strengthen your stamina.

624
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,550
He doesn't want you to get into danger.

625
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,130
But...

626
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,670
Let's go.

627
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,430
I'm an injured person.

628
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,030
You've fully recovered, right?

629
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,370
Let's go.

630
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,630
I can walk on my own.

631
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,750
Here, run now.

632
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,130
Keep running.

633
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,600
Let go of me. I can run on my own.

634
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,870
Run on your own.

635
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,950
Keep running.

636
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,870
One, two, three, four.

637
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,910
Xia Chu, I'll beat you up if I catch you.

638
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,990
-I'm coming.
-I can run on my own!

639
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,520
Stop following me!

640
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,840
When you're in danger,

641
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,670
you should run at first instance, got it?

642
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,520
Watch your arms. Swing your arms.

643
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,710
Keep it low.

644
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,160
Don't stop. Keep running.

645
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,030
I can run on my own!

646
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,850
Try it.

647
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,430
I have to practice shooting too?

648
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,260
It's an order from Brigade Commander.

649
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,390
I've only used a rifle before
when I was in recruit company.

650
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,400
Stand here.

651
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,110
Hit the humanoid target at the front.

652
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,970
Here.

653
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,190
Aim carefully.

654
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,510
Liang Mu Ze, I've never used a gun before.

655
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,750
A gun is not much different from a rifle.

656
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,030
Adjust your breathing and relax.

657
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:28,399
♫ We'll have ups and downs ♫

658
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:35,050
♫ The journey to happiness is bound
to be filled with waves ♫

659
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,830
Don't be nervous.

660
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,180
♫ I'm glad we came through the
obstacles that time has brought upon us ♫

661
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,669
Hold the gun firmly.

662
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:47,939
♫ My hands are still eager
to hold you tight ♫

663
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,899
♫ Nothing matters as long as
our smiles outweigh our tears ♫

664
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:03,290
♫ Others can doubt me as long as
I have your trust ♫

665
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,310
What do you think?

666
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,800
Liang Mu Ze, look!

667
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,200
If you connect the bullet holes,

668
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,450
♫ Our souls cross paths
as our gaze meet ♫

669
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,390
you can see a heart shape!

670
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:16,410
♫ Some words you can understand
even if I don't say it ♫

671
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,350
Do it again.

672
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,670
♫ I promise I won't let you slip by ♫

673
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:30,840
♫ Exchanging everything, we'll become
each other's destiny ♫

674
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,350
Liang Mu Ze is a jerk.

675
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,830
He trained me as if I'm a soldier.

676
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,550
He claimed that he didn't shout at me.

677
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,000
♫ I'll make your heart my kingdom ♫

678
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,820
♫ You and I will make our dream
come true with our lives ♫

679
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,030
Assemble!

680
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,590
One, two, one!

681
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,830
Comrades.

682
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,350
Lately,

683
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,830
the Southeast region of our country

684
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,840
has been experiencing

685
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,150
heavy rain and flood disaster.

686
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,350
In order to protect
the people and their property,

687
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,510
we've been instructed

688
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,110
to aid the disaster areas.

689
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,870
The fighting is going to begin soon.

690
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,310
I only have one requirement.

691
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,230
Confront the danger.

692
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,980
Help and protect the dyke.

693
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,750
Before the rain stops, we won't give up!

694
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,950
Got it?

695
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,950
Yes!

696
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,390
Let's go!

697
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,540
Turn to the rear.

698
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,630
Start marching!

699
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,510
Captain!

700
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,110
Take care!

701
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,790
Take care, Liang Mu Ze.

702
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,850
I'm back.

703
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,670
-You're back.
-Come here.

704
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,440
-Has your leg recovered?
-Are you okay?

705
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm okay. I've fully recovered.

706
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,440
-You've recovered.
-What are you doing?

707
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,650
-Reading the flood fighting news.
-Look.

708
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,990
They've been immersed
in the water for many days.

709
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,810
It's stated in the news that
many troops

710
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,030
are rushing to the areas.

711
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,590
Xia Chu.

712
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,160
Dr Zhang.

713
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,230
You're back.

714
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,240
How do you feel?

715
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,390
I've recovered.
I can start working anytime.

716
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,650
That's great.

717
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,230
Is my hairstyle all right?

718
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,870
Dr Zhang, you're...

719
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,950
I'm filming a show.

720
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,150
There is a lady by the name of Mi Gu
from the life channel.

721
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,320
Do you know her?

722
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,950
I know her. She's my best friend.

723
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,490
She wants to produce

724
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,390
a medicine related documentary.

725
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,510
I'll be the main character
in the documentary.

726
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,350
Please work with her.

727
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,490
Don't worry.

728
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,270
Is she single?

729
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,050
Dr Zhang!

730
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,680
Dean.

731
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,390
Allow me to introduce someone to you.

732
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,310
He is Deputy Dean Zhou.

733
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,550
Hello, Deputy Dean Zhou.

734
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,520
Thank you for

735
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,950
being interested in the hospital.

736
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,280
You're so kind, Dean.

737
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,250
We would like to thank you

738
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,830
for supporting our show.

739
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,630
That's our duty.

740
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,130
This is...

741
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,550
I don't think
there's a need to introduce him.

742
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,570
Hello.

743
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:10,910
Hello.

744
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,080
We decided to film the signing ceremony
at the eleventh hour.

745
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,070
Sorry to have...

746
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm sorry. I need to answer a phone call.

747
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,760
Xiao Wen, please communicate
with the other leaders

748
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,760
and Mr Zhuo

749
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,160
regarding the filming details.

750
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,310
Okay, Ms Gu.

751
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,790
Thank you.

752
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,470
[Xia Chu]

753
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,200
I changed Xiao Jun's dressing for you

754
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:58,880
and you promised

755
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,230
to prepare two weeks worth
of medical orders.

756
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:02,950
Please honour your words.

757
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,610
It's an honour

758
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,830
to set up a special fund

759
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,630
with the hospital.

760
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,830
We will develop 3D medicine production,

761
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,190
organ printing,

762
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,680
auxiliary instrument printing and so on

763
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,030
in full swing.

764
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,670
We believe that

765
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,280
following the rapid development

766
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,270
of 3D printing,

767
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,840
we will welcome

768
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,430
the new era

769
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,470
of personalised medicine.

770
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,830
Take some scenery shots
in the hospital later.

771
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:57,800
Sure.

772
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,230
I hope everything
goes according to plan.

773
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:01,760
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

774
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:02,730
I'll see you off.

775
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,760
How long will the filming take?

776
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,200
Let's go for dinner tonight.

777
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,990
Should I wait for you?

778
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,470
Are you not going to join
the photography session?

779
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,030
Why should I join?

780
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,820
He's young and talented.

781
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,130
I'm sorry.

782
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,710
Please hold on.

783
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,090
Mi Gu.

784
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,140
Let's go for dinner tonight.

785
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,590
I'll invite Xia Chu too.

786
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,190
Dr Zhang, please join us.

787
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,170
Sure.

788
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,480
I have something to do at night.

789
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,450
Well...

790
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,990
Dr Zhang, don't we have a date?

791
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,030
I'm sorry. I forgot that.

792
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,910
We have a discussion.

793
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,750
I'll not take up your time then.

794
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,910
I'm leaving.

795
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,270
Why did you do that?
