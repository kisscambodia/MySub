00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,270
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,130
I still remember

5
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,220
the time he was unconscious,

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,480
he kept calling out Xia Chu's name.

7
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,970
When a man doesn't have you in his heart,

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,800
there's no point pushing it.

9
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,090
I'm not pushing it.

10
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,320
I'm just trying to stop my own thoughts.

11
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,290
Xia Chu still doesn't know?

12
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,210
Here's an advice for you.

13
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:23,279
A friend's ex,

14
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,960
is like a used car
driven by your friend.

15
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,640
Avoid it at all cost.

16
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:28,930
It's too troublesome.

17
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,720
If you really want it,

18
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,610
then be honest with your friend upfront.

19
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,930
It'll save you both
from awkwardness in future.

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,480
I'm speaking from experience.

21
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,570
Miss Gu, the scenery shot is done.

22
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,020
I'll show you the sample video
once it's ready.

23
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,800
If there're further ideas,
we can discuss more specifically.

24
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,770
Sure.

25
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,860
Thanks, Dr Zhang.

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,210
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,330
"A potential long-term partner."

28
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,210
Zhang Yi Chi, are you so desperate?

29
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm single. Of course I am.

30
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,130
It's not like I cheat on my partner.

31
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,650
You're bringing this up again?

32
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,210
Are you going to hold onto this
for the rest of your life?

33
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,450
-Don't start with me.
-Hold on.

34
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,610
Your patient, Luo Xiao Jun

35
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,210
sent this postcard to the department.

36
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,250
I just saw it.

37
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,410
I'm willing to offer my help

38
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,370
to your charity project.

39
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,690
I have no say in that charity project.

40
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,810
Please think of something to help me out.

41
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,170
Won't you help me, please?

42
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,860
I'm applying for
an overseas graduate school.

43
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,310
A background in innovative
scientific research

44
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,660
will improve my chances by a lot.

45
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,140
Why are you asking my help for everything?

46
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,260
That's your problem.

47
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,090
I'm no longer obligated to help you.

48
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,140
You're the reason

49
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,750
I stayed here in the first place.

50
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,170
I don't even have a single friend here.

51
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,050
I have nobody to help me.

52
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,330
I don't know where to get help.

53
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,000
Fine.

54
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,890
I'll try to ask Director Chen later.

55
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,510
Thanks.

56
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,800
What are you doing?

57
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,050
She's insane.

58
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,650
I'm almost done.

59
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,750
I'll wait.

60
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,210
I mistook you for my colleague.

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,080
Xia Chu.

62
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,810
Are you feeling better?

63
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,810
Yes. I've recovered.

64
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,340
Why are you here then?

65
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,700
To sign a contract.

66
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,710
I just met up with Dr Zhang and his peers.

67
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,180
Are you free tonight?

68
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,330
No, I'm not. I've made arrangements
with my friend.

69
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,780
It's Mi Gu, the one the other day...

70
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,170
She's meeting Dr Zhang later.

71
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,090
Didn't she tell you?

72
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,230
Maybe she sent a message.

73
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,290
But I haven't read it yet.

74
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,609
So you're free tonight then?

75
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,210
I'm off to settle some matters now.

76
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,620
Wait...

77
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,580
What happened?

78
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,650
Let me take a look at it?

79
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,970
I have to get help from the
IT department.

80
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,380
So how is it?

81
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,170
Can all the information be retrieved?

82
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,610
No problem. It's almost done.

83
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,440
Great.

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,430
But why did this happen suddenly?

85
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,330
Maybe it was a heat dissipation problem.

86
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,210
Also,

87
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,960
try not to open too many pages at once.

88
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,970
After work,

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,410
remember to switch off the computer.

90
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,990
Got it.

91
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,890
Okay.

92
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,920
It's done?

93
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,070
Thanks.

94
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,170
I really appreciate it.

95
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,530
What do you plan to have for dinner?

96
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,730
I'm not done with my work yet.

97
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,370
I'll wait.

98
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,130
It's just dinner.

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,730
You'll have to eat after all, don't you?

100
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,310
Okay then.

101
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,290
Both your parents are in Dongan.

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,170
Your home is there too.

103
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,170
Why didn't you transfer
to the military hospital there?

104
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,810
After graduating from
military medical school,

105
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,240
I just went with the military order.

106
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,910
Or is it because

107
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,490
you know my home is in Ningjiang?

108
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,850
I've almost forgotten it.

109
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,970
I don't believe you.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,470
There are many good things in this world.

111
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,210
After we've experienced them,
it's hard to forget.

112
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,970
For example,

113
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,530
grilled eel.

114
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,810
For example,

115
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,730
you and me.

116
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,420
Hi there.

117
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,410
Where's the classroom for twelfth grade?

118
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,730
That way. The third classroom
after you turn left.

119
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,480
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,650
[I didn't dare drink too much water]

140
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,850
in case I missed you
if I went to the toilet.

141
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,820
I was afraid you couldn't find me

142
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,250
when you came back.

143
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,600
It's like the television dramas.

144
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,130
I didn't want to let you go that easily.

145
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,130
I waited until the shop closed,

146
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,450
but you never showed up.

147
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,970
And you never showed up since.

148
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,090
That won't happen again.

149
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,690
Xia Chu.

150
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,170
What makes you believe that

151
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,410
we have a future together?

152
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,770
Because you still care.

153
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,110
I'm over it.

154
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,020
If you really did,

155
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,800
you wouldn't have said those things.

156
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,820
Hi, my darlings.

157
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm almost home.

158
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,030
I don't know why

159
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm so easily tired these days.

160
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,530
Maybe it's my age.

161
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,570
Really?

162
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,100
When women feel tired,

163
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,770
that's when they want to get married?

164
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,530
I think I need sleep more than

165
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,450
I need a husband in my life.

166
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,380
I'm entering the lift.

167
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,130
The connection might be bad inside.

168
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,210
How are you guys doing lately?

169
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,690
Did you miss me?

170
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,950
Miss.

171
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,500
You dropped your phone.

172
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,410
Do you remember me?

173
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,580
No, I don't.

174
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,850
It's me.

175
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,620
The other day,
we met in an alley

176
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,140
behind the hotel.

177
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,580
The night you went jogging.

178
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,770
Do you recall?

179
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,450
You've mistaken me for someone else.

180
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,180
I fell in love with you at first sight.

181
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,850
How can I mistake you for somebody else?

182
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,540
Why don't we be friends?

183
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,750
I know you're Mi Gu.

184
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,390
You're 32 years old and
your Chinese zodiac is a dragon.

185
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,830
You're a psycho.

186
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,750
Am I right?

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,530
Help. Help!

188
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,730
Who are you? Get your hands off her.

189
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,970
Get away, you psycho.

190
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,970
-Get away.
-Stop hitting me.

191
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,740
Xia Chu.

192
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,550
Forget it.

193
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,970
What's happened? Who is he?

194
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,650
A psycho.

195
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,740
Are you okay?

196
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes.

197
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,680
Feeling better now?

198
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,190
Yes.

199
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,400
Drink with me.

200
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,890
I can't.
The hospital might call me anytime.

201
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,840
I'll have soda.

202
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,840
That one, please.

203
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,330
When did you come here?

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,420
Not too long ago.

205
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,200
I knocked but no one answered.

206
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,730
I also called but you didn't pick up.

207
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,170
I fell asleep waiting at the front door.

208
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,910
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,730
I was extremely busy today.

210
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,220
The shots that were done needed editing.

211
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,190
I get it.

212
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,340
-Workaholic.
-And that's coming from you?

213
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,210
Speak for yourself, Dr Xia.

214
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,140
I don't have that sort of
aesthetic capital like you do.

215
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,730
I can't afford to slack at all.

216
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,250
That's not true.

217
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,630
Such things are unreliable.

218
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,580
No matter how much aesthetic capital
one possesses,

219
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,100
it won't withstand the pull of gravity.

220
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,590
If I don't work hard now,

221
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,380
once I'm old and grey,

222
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,850
what can I survive on?

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,460
How was your date with Dr Zhang?

224
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,410
Zhuo Ran told me about it.

225
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,100
We just discussed about work over a meal.

226
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,290
It doesn't count as a date.

227
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,250
And you?

228
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,970
Did you have dinner with Zhuo Ran?

229
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,650
Do you still

230
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,700
have feelings for him?

231
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,930
We went for Japanese cuisine.

232
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,610
He knows what I like.

233
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,580
He knows I prefer

234
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,090
fresh ingredients,

235
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,890
plain dishes,

236
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,610
sweet and sour ones

237
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,520
and Ramune soda.

238
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,360
On the matter of food,

239
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,810
he knows all my preferences
very well.

240
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,410
That's great.

241
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,810
It would be if relationships are only

242
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,290
about three meals a day.

243
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,940
Isn't it so?

244
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,420
Don't our daily habits often times

245
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,540
make up the most important aspects
of a relationship?

246
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,730
But i think that sometimes

247
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,380
commitment is more important
than love itself.

248
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,120
Cheers, Mi Gu.

249
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,880
It doesn't matter if love ever comes,

250
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,450
I'm all good as long as you are here.

251
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,730
I am here.

252
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,350
I'll definitely be here.

253
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,380
[From tonight until tomorrow,]

254
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,020
[most coastal regions of Dongan]

255
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,900
[will be continuously hit
by heavy rainstorms.]

256
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,850
[Various areas will be affected
by the flooding.]

257
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,370
[Notice on the recruitment of volunteers
for disaster relief]

258
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,850
Thanks, Xia Chu.

259
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,820
Xia Chu.

260
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,510
Look at these cakes. Pick one first.

261
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,900
Xia Chu. I want this matcha cake.

262
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,270
It looks so cute.

263
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,290
Settle down.

264
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,910
We've got to ask her something.

265
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,250
What's this about?

266
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,220
"To Xia Chu and all medical officers

267
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,340
of the Cardio Surgery Department,

268
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,930
have a great working day.

269
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,290
Yours truly, Zhuo Ran."

270
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,690
Who is Zhuo Ran?

271
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,290
Xia Chu, who is this Zhuo Ran?

272
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,060
He even knows

273
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,330
everyone's palates.

274
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,160
Did you tell him?

275
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,610
It seems like

276
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,210
that military officer is out of the game.

277
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,810
Xia Chu.

278
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,210
We've received the desserts.

279
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,250
Everyone enjoyed it.

280
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,819
Thank you.

281
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:30,970
Director Zhang.

282
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,380
Isn't the participation voluntary?

283
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,040
I don't want to go.

284
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,010
This is your job.

285
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,810
If everyone doesn't want to go,

286
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,990
what should we do about it?

287
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,510
But why must it be me?

288
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,490
I'll tell you why.

289
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,860
Many times before, when our sister unit

290
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,050
requested medical security,

291
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,020
every resident doctor has all participated

292
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,010
on rotational basis,

293
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,970
except you.

294
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,260
Remember,

295
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,520
we've all got to give back eventually.

296
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,620
Give me the medical records for ward 9.

297
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,730
But I...

298
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,850
I'll go.

299
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,090
You want to go to the flood-plagued areas?

300
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,070
Yes.

301
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,220
Forget it.

302
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,060
Your leg...

303
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,770
It's healed completely.

304
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,790
I should let you know.

305
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,680
A patient with heart failure
from emergency department

306
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,010
will undergo heart transplant next week.

307
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,210
Moreover, it will be done by the director.

308
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,180
He said that

309
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,700
all resident doctors

310
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,480
can be present for on-site observation.

311
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,840
Listen.

312
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,210
This is a rare opportunity

313
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,570
even for our hospital.

314
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,690
Are you still sure you want to go?

315
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,530
I'm sure.

316
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,130
In peaceful times like this,

317
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,010
experiences similar to being a war doctor

318
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,290
is quite rare too.

319
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,500
Alright then.

320
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,570
Make two photocopies,

321
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,990
fill them up

322
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,160
and the both of you submit them
to administration.

323
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,300
No, wait.

324
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,900
Do I still have to go
even when she's going?

325
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,490
She's going out of enlightenment.

326
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,970
You're going because it's your duty.

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,960
Stop staring at me with those big eyes.

328
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,090
What bad luck.

329
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,510
Reflecting it back to you.

330
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,650
[Which flooded area did
your handsome landlord go?]

331
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,050
[Will you meet him there?]

332
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,130
I don't know.

333
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,090
He said nothing about it when he left.

334
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,120
But special forces like his

335
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,140
will usually be the first
to arrive on site

336
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,530
but but the last to leave.

337
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,330
They're the first line of defence

338
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,250
and the last as well.

339
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,720
They just leap to where danger is.

340
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,530
They must be super courageous then.

341
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,740
Yes, that's right.

342
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,540
[So Liang Mu Ze's insomnia]

343
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,810
[is pretty tough on him.]

344
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,770
Why does something sound off.

345
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,370
[What is it?]

346
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,980
When you talked about him before,

347
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,980
you'd say he's strange,

348
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,050
doesn't sleep and how psychotic that is.

349
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,450
When have I?

350
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,310
[You're denying? You did say that.]

351
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,290
Fine, I'm hanging up now.

352
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,770
I've got to pack.

353
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,860
Remember to come pick Er Miao up.

354
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,550
I'll be gone for quite some time.

355
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,570
I can't let it stay all alone at home.

356
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,420
Got it.

357
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,730
Hanging up now, bye.

358
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,050
Alright.

359
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,990
[Er Miao.]

360
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,610
[Should I bring Liang Mu Ze]

361
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,330
[some medicine to help him sleep?]

362
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,740
Let's do this.
If you meow twice, I'll bring it.

363
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,370
If you meow once, I won't.

364
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,650
You get to decide.

365
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,130
Hey, you have to meow twice.

366
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,130
Meow.

367
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,070
Alright then.
I'll get the medicine.

368
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,200
[You can do it, Liang Mu Ze.]

369
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,540
I'll take a head count.

370
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,930
We'll move out once everybody is here.

371
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,960
Has everyone arrived?

372
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,450
I'm sorry I'm late.

374
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,450
It's okay. You arrived just in time.

375
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,060
-Let's move out.
-Yes, sir.

376
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,930
To the left, march.

How are you?

384
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,970
Here.

385
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,550
Hang in there.

386
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,440
How much longer till we reach?

387
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,290
Let me check.

388
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,600
Another 50 over kilometres to go.

389
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,640
What happened?

390
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,880
I've never done an operation yet.

391
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,340
I don't want to die.

392
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,800
Is everyone okay?

393
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,050
We're fine.

394
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,750
-What happened?
-What happened?

395
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,590
Are you okay?

396
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,910
I've cleaned your uniform

397
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,090
and placed it in the bus.

398
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,160
Have some water.

399
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,400
No, thanks.

400
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,180
If you have something to say,
just say it.

401
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,060
Stop pretending to be generous.

402
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,670
You stop pretending to be petty too.

403
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,970
Me?

404
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,800
At the moment of danger just now,

405
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,200
I heard you scream out

406
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,930
not wanting to die

407
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,810
because you haven't taken on
the operating table yet.

408
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,220
At that moment,

409
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,130
I decided to forgive

410
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,460
all your peculiar, selfish

411
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,210
and petty behaviours in the past.

412
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,270
It's because I know

413
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,960
you want to be a good doctor

414
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,440
like me.

415
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,980
Peculiar, selfish and petty?

416
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,880
Listen here, Xia Chu.

417
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,740
Just because I hugged you back there
doesn't mean that

418
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,580
you get to say all that to me.

419
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,430
I'll not accept that.

420
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,590
Why is it taking so long to change a tyre?

421
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,370
Do you need help, sir?

422
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,030
I can't change it. My tools won't work.

423
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,810
Then what should we do?

424
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,000
Stop.

425
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,830
Stop, stop. We need help!

426

427
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,290
We need help.

428
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,170
What's the matter?

429
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,060
Our tyre got punctured.

430
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,810
My tools can't repair it.

431
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,260
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,100
Get our men to help.

433
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,860
Yes, sir.

434
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,410
Grab the jack lift.

435
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,180
You had them come over to help?

436
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,620
You think I’m capable of that?

437
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,330
What's the matter?

438
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,290
Sir, are you okay? Where does it hurt?

439
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,960
Come over and help get him on the truck.

440
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,720
One, two, up.

441
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,410
His blood pressure has
plunged to 60/90mmHg.

442
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,770
Heartbeat is at 105.

443
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,060
You two are the only doctors

444
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,220
from the Cardiac Surgery Department.

445
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,530
Think about something.

446
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,970
What should we do?

447
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,050
I don't know.

448
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,390
How's it?

449
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,860
Can he be saved?

450
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,580
I said I don't know!

451
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,940
Close those blinds now.

452
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,260
Have your men block the road

453
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,450
to prevent further accidents.

454
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,170
His blood pressure is still falling.

455
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,810
Could it be myocardial ischaemia?

456
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,020
No, his heart rate indicated

457
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,850
a lot of blood in the pericardial cavity.

458
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,930
It could be acute haemopneumothorax.

459
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,730
-We can inject dopamine.
-No.

460
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,310
Dopamine and noradrenaline could increase

461
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,410
myocardial oxygen consumption.

462
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,320
You two have to give him an operation.

463
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,210
But I've never seen
this operation done before.

464
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,400
This remote place

465
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,890
has no signal at all.

466
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,130
What if we send him back
to the station first?

467
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,100
We'll figure it out after that.

468
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,450
He won't make it.

469
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,570
His pulse is already very weak.

470
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,210
You'll need to open his pericardial cavity

471
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,300
and identify the location of the bleeding.

472
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,890
Who's going to do it? Quickly now.

473
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,640
No, it can't be done here.

474

477
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,940
You do it.

478
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,010
Sterilize her and prepare for surgery.

479
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,330
Yes.

480
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,910
This road is blocked.

481
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,810
Go that way.

482
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,770
That way.

484
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,160
Have you found the location of bleeding?

485
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,190
Remove the excess blood.

486
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,100
The patient is in shock.

487
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,180
Quick, administer the
anti-shock treatment.

488
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,460
Suction.

489
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,770
I found the location of bleeding.

490
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,350
Get ready to stitch the wound.

491
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,140
Trust yourself. You can do it.

492
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,090

Where did she go?

556
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,170
Her hospital formed a medical team

557
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,810
for the flood relief.

558
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,990
No wonder she didn't answer my calls
these days.

559
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,330
The calls never went through.

560
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,460
Rural areas tend to have bad signal.

561
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,690
Moreover, there's the heavy downpour too.

562
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,180
It's normal that the calls
can't get through.

563
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,440
Please don't worry yourselves too much.

564
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,240
You've always been in contact

565
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,880
with Xia Chu?

566
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,350
Yes.

567
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,310
I heard that you left for some time.

568
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,580
That's true.

569
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,330
My mother was sick.

570
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,910
During senior year of high school,
her condition worsened.

571
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,810
After that, a distant relative

572
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,770
introduced her to an overseas doctor.

573
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,490
I left in quite a hurry.

574
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,900
That's why I didn't manage

575
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,450
to properly say goodbye to Xia Chu.

576
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,210
How is your mother doing now?

577
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,010
She's dependent on medicine.

578
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,980
I'm sorry.

579
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,290
It must be hard to talk about.

580
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,410
No, it's fine.

581
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,810
In fact I've been keeping it inside
for quite sometime.

582
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,170
It's kind of a relief for me

583
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,580
to have shared it with you.

584
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,540
Anyway,

585
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,770
how are you and Uncle Xia doing?

586
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,740
We're both fine.

587
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,970
I read on the international news online

588
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,940
that Uncle Xia and his team

589
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,530
had some new research findings.

590
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,830
You don't seem too concerned

591
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,500
with Uncle Xia's work?

592
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,030
It's not that.

593
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,180
There are many people
who are concerned about his work.

594
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,820
For me, the real concern

595
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,970
is whether he has taken
his three meals everyday

596
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,290
or if he's eating well.

597
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,830
What more can a husband ask for
with such a loving wife?

598
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,390
Xia, when did you came home?

599
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,770
Last night.

600
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,630
I was afraid to wake you up.

601
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,300
So I slept in the study instead.

602
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,660
Look at you.

603
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,680
You haven't eaten, have you?

604
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,010
Don't worry.

605
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,370
I'm leaving soon.

606
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,400
So soon?

607
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,740
You spend a night home

608
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,230
just to leave again next morning?

609
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,690
Why come back in the first place?

610
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,220
I had to use the toilet.

611
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,000
What's wrong with saying that?

612
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,150
You know I'm very particular
with the toilet I use.

613
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,040
I had constipation for days.

614
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,970
Last night, I suddenly had an urge to go.

615
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,250
So I came home to give it a go.

616
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,770
Did it go well?

617
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,060
This is Xia Chu's friend, Zhuo Ran.

618
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,260
I meant the experiment.

619
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,590
I heard the conversation between you two.

620
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,810
Back then, my daughter shed

621
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,610
quite a lot of tears for you.

622
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,550
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,400
I won't let it happen again.

624
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,650
Thanks for visiting us.

625
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,890
If you're trying to impress Xia Chu

626
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,660
by going through us,

627
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,890
it probably won't work.

628
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,010
I'm going to wash up now.

629
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,360
Hopefully once I'm done,

630
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,650
you've already left

631
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,900
along with your gifts.

632
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,670
[Dongan University Parking Permit]

633
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,650
Xia.

634
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,060
Did you know that Xia Chu
went to the frontline

635
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,660
for the flood relief work?

636
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,600
Has that wild brat ever

637
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,530
told us anything?

638
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,460
But it's good for her too.

639
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,170
Good? I beg your pardon?

640
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,170
She's a military doctor.

641
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,450
It will give her
valuable field experience.

642
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,640
So she's a military doctor,
but not your daughter?

643
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,930
She's a single young lady.

644
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,640
Flood relief is dangerous work.

645
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,600
I can't ignore it.

646
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:37,900
I'll have to get my father

647
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,680
to transfer her back here.

648
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,460
She's just drifting from place to place

649
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,570
and it worries me.

650
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,210
He doesn't need to get involved
in my daughter's matter.

651
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,550
What are you talking about?

652
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,530
He's Xia Chu's grandpa
and your father-in-law.

653
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,170
But he was never fond of me.

654
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,240
I got it, Director Zhang.

655
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,620
Okay, got it.

656
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,800
Why haven't you left?

657
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,990
I needed to answer a phone call.

658
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,590
Professor Xia.

659
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,220
Can I be of any help?

660
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,010
I saw a few kids

661
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,050
running around with some scissors.

662
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,960
Where did they go?

663
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,970
My ride just arrived at the main entrance.

664
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,590
Are you heading back
to the research institute?

665
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,980
I'm on my way to the airport.

666
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,240
I can give you a ride.

667
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,360
It's hard to hail a cab at this hour.

668
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,330
What kind of job are you doing now?

669
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,750

670
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,900

we'll have any business dealings.

arriving in the afternoon.

Yes.

We're finally done
with this horrible place.

But, this horrible place turns out to be

an integral milestone
for Xia Chu's profession.

690
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,600
Isn't that right, Xia Chu?

691
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,410
Although I appreciate the chance
to act as a chief surgeon,

692
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,530
I'd rather hope

in the first place.

can't do anything about him.
