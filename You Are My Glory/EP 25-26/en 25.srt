=Episode 25=

14
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,799
What time is it now?

15
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,319
Why isn't

16
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,719
Qiao Jingjing out yet?

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
I woke up really early today.

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,319
I'm getting sleepy.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,520
They drew the curtains.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,759
I don't think

21
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,960
we can get any scoop tonight.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,199
Let's wait a little longer.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,479
We caught them getting down from the car

24
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,879
and going into the apartment together.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
We'll see if we can

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
catch them coming out together.

27
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,560
Keep a close eye.

28
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,479
Did you use a new hero

29
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,879
to make us lose on purpose?

30
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,280
What?

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,000
We lost in the first three rounds

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
but you were the MVP

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
in every match.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
Who is losing on purpose now?

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,039
I still think you did.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
Well, actually...

37
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,400
Never mind.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Next time,

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,039
I'll introduce my boyfriend to you.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,120
He'll carry you.

41
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,120
He's amazing as the jungler.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,800
He can end the game in 10 minutes.

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
What?

44
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,560
You have a boyfriend

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
and you didn't tell me?

46
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,319
Who? Duan Wu?

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,680
Get lost.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
Come on.

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,319
He's not a celebrity.

50
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,439
He's good-looking

51
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,199
and he's really good at games.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,639
He's a liar who likes
giving me the puppy-dog eyes.

53
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,159
He's also perceptive.

54
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,599
My friend.

55
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,639
I don't know

56
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,560
if I should say this.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Just say it.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,199
He doesn't sound like

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,240
a decent guy.

60
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,039
He's out! Hurry and take the picture!

61
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,319
Why is it just him?

62
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,400
Where's Qiao Jingjing?

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,199
My gosh.

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,199
Qiao... Qiao Jingjing is staying the night!

65
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,479
It's confirmed.

66
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,439
That's her luggage.

67
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,919
She's spending the night here.

68
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,039
She could still get away last time

69
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,039
by saying she went to
her friend's house.

70
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,599
But we got her now.

71
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,960
He's taking her luggage upstairs.

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
We have evidence.

73
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,120
The three of us

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
will stay here all night

75
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,319
and take turns to keep on the lookout.

76
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,319
We must get pictures of them

77
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,560
coming out of the apartment together!

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
This is great for us!

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
We hit the jackpot!

80
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I come in?

81
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,279
Hold on.

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Come in.

83
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm here to get the blanket and pillow.

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,079
Goodnight.

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Goodnight.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,480
(I'm staying at
my boyfriend's house tonight.)

87
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,959
(Will I be able to sleep?)

88
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,720
(What if I'm not at my best
for the event tomorrow?)

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,199
(Are you both so full of energy)

90
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,199
(that it's going to affect
you tomorrow?)

91
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,360
(It's going to take all night?)

92
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,399
(I got it now.)

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,360
(You played)

94
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
(the first three rounds.)

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,639
(The rest was him.)

96
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,759
(Am I right?)

97
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,319
(Goodnight.)

98
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,759
(Are you both so full of energy)

99
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,480
(that it's going to affect
you tomorrow?)

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,639
(It's going to take all night?)

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,279
(You are annoying!)

102
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,519
(It ended so quickly?)

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
(Why are you blaming me?)

104
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,079
(We just got together not long ago.)

105
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,240
(We are sleeping in separate rooms.)

106
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,480
(That's not my fault, too.)

107
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,920
(It's him.)

108
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,000
(Chen Xue recalled a message)

109
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,040
(He doesn't know better.)

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,759
(Goodbye!)

111
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,079
You're not sleeping yet?

112
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,199
Are you feeling cold?

113
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,480
No.

114
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,639
I'll get you a blanket.

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm not feeling cold.

116
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,240
Why are you still working?

117
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,480
I can't bring my work home.

118
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,240
I'm doing some translation.

119
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,639
What is it about?

120
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,879
It's about the Deep Space Probe

121
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,680
and its low-thrust orbit transfers

122
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,839
design optimization.

123
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
You carry on.

124
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,079
You should go to bed now.

125
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:15,920
Don't you

126
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,199
have work tomorrow?

127
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,120
You're not going to bed either.

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,800
Didn't you say

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,199
you haven't been able
to rest for the last few days?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,519
But I have to

131
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,879
go through some thesis tonight.

132
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,800
To calm myself down.

133
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm going to bed.

134
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,200
Don't you come out again.

135
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Or else...

136
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,440
Get some sleep.

137
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,799
Or else what?

138
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,799
(Send me the interview outline)

139
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,879
(for tomorrow.)

140
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,519
(You're not sleeping yet?)

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,840
(You can still read it)

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,879
(when you do your makeup tomorrow.)

143
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,879
(Sleep early to get some rest.)

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,039
(Just send it to me.)

145
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,919
(I need it to keep calm.)

146
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,240
You're awake?

147
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,720
You look half-asleep.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
You look silly.

149
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,200
You're silly.

150
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,720
The pillow is too high.

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,080
It's uncomfortable.

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,919
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

153
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,919
I'll change it today.

154
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,840
You asked me

155
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,399
not to come out yesterday.

156
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,120
I think I did.

157
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,799
You could have called me.

158
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm starving. Where's my breakfast?

159
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,159
Let's have breakfast then.

160
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,639
What time are we leaving later?

161
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,799
I'm getting my makeup done
at the hotel at 12 noon.

162
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,279
I haven't told Xiao Zhu

163
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,480
that I'm at your place.

164
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:15,039
(Jingjing, Ms. Ling, Xiao Zhu)

165
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,559
(You don't have to)

166
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,919
(pick me up at Lujiazui.)

167
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,919
(I'm with Mr. Yu.)

168
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,360
(I'll go to the hotel myself.)

169
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:28,960
Qiao Jingjing.

170
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,840
I can't believe you are at his place.

171
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:31,600
Can you stop

172
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
making a fuss out of it?

173
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,159
My phone is on speaker.

174
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,440
Mr. Yu is listening to our conversation.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,080
I'm making a fuss?

176
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,039
You asked for the interview outline

177
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,159
yesterday in the middle of the night.

178
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,200
You said you wanted it

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,360
to keep calm.

180
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,879
Why didn't you tell me
you're at his place?

181
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,480
Didn't I tell you

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
before you left?

183
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,919
I told Xiao Zhu

184
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,120
to go to the hotel right away, too.

185
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I'll be there after I had breakfast

186
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
with Mr. Yu.

187
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,200
Just the two of you?

188
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,039
No way.

189
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,840
I'll come and pick you up.

190
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,759
There's still some time.

191
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,639
Send me the address.

192
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,600
Your house address.

193
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,279
I'll send it to her.

194
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,080
You haven't had breakfast either?

195
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,799
I was waiting for you.

196
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,519
It wasn't very helpful.

197
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,600
Translating the thesis.

198
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,720
Her team is here to pick her up.

199
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Looks like she is going public.

200
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,799
Her boyfriend

201
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,360
is going to the event with her?

202
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,039
They are still in their honeymoon phase.

203
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,679
Follow them.

204
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Let's go.

205
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,679
We'll reach the hotel

206
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,600
at 12 noon.

207
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,559
You'll get your makeup done first.

208
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,480
Then, it's the magazine interview.

209
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,240
The event tonight

210
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,639
starts at 6:30 PM.

211
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,279
Are you still staying at

212
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,720
Mr. Yu's place tonight?

213
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,360
Depends on the traffic.

214
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,720
Last night was because

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,799
Lujiazui's traffic

216
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,000
was terrible.

217
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,720
So I went to his house

218
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,440
to stay for a bit.

219
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,799
Then, I was too tired to go back.

220
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,360
Xiao Zhu, watch and learn.

221
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Shanghai's traffic.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Traffic.

223
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,600
What is Mr. Yu going to do

224
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,759
when you do your makeup at the hotel?

225
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,600
He can pretend as one of the staff

226
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,320
and come with us.

227
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,639
Are you not aware of

228
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,559
how good-looking your boyfriend is?

229
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,639
Him pretending as the staff?

230
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Of course I do.

231
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
Then, why did you come up with
this terrible idea?

232
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,320
I just want you to compliment his look.

233
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,679
Well then, Mr. Yu.

234
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,279
When we got there,

235
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,600
you'll have to find somewhere

236
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,159
and wait for us there.

237
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,919
Sure.

238
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,919
Actually, Mr. Yu

239
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,320
has a wide range.

240
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
Just change his hairstyle,

241
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,080
put on a pair of glasses

242
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,600
and change his outfit.

243
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,200
He can totally

244
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,120
pass as my image consultant.

245
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:47,879
Ivan's styling studio

246
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,440
is just in front.

247
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,840
We still have some time.

248
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,000
Why don't we stop by?

249
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,879
Let's go.

250
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,440
Today

251
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
is the peak of my career as a manager.

252
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
Both of them

253
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,639
are my top artists.

254
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,320
But Mr. Yu

255
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,639
doesn't want to be a celebrity.

256
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,440
Zip it.

257
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,360
I can't even fantasize?

258
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,120
Ms. Qiu, that handsome man over there.

259
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,559
Is he your new artist?

260
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,279
He is the new staff

261
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,320
in our studio.

262
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Staff?

263
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
Ms. Qiu, what a waste.

264
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,080
He should be an artist with that face.

265
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,919
I'm considering it, too.

266
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,519
What do you think?

267
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,519
Will he be famous?

268
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,440
Of course he will.

269
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
He's dashing.

270
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,279
And there's something special about him.

271
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,159
Ms. Qiu, where did you find him?

272
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,799
If Jingjing can bring him

273
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,600
to some events,

274
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:40,840
to some events,

275
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,759
everyone will want to offer him a role.

276
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,080
I hope so.

277
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,279
Yu, what do you think?

278
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,600
I'll make you a celebrity.

279
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,240
Jingjing will bring you to some events

280
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,519
and you will be famous in no time.

281
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,519
I can't do that.

282
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't simply do that.

283
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,559
If I have to,

284
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,279
that person has to

285
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,639
sign a 10-year contract with me.

286
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,879
Ms. Qiao, I can sign a longer contract.

287
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,400
And how do we distribute the money?

288
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,920
I just need some

289
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,880
living expenses.

290
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,519
All right.

291
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll think about it.

292
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,200
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

293
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,319
Ms, Qiu.

294
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,759
Your company has really strict

295
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,880
contract terms.

296
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,359
Keep it to yourself.

297
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,160
Jingjing.

298
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,759
We prepared

299
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,039
three gowns for you.

300
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,200
You may pick the gown that

301
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,839
goes well with the jewellery.

302
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
She is done with her makeup?

303
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,519
Xiao Zhu.

304
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,319
Please bring them downstairs

305
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,759
for afternoon tea.

306
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,559
Get some rest.

307
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,599
We will leave together

308
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,680
when it's time, all right?

309
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,359
Thank you.

310
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,480
I'll leave them to you.

311
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,359
Goodbye.

312
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,839
You can change into the gown later.

313
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,000
Get the interview done first.

314
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
But journalists

315
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,640
are more sensitive.

316
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,119
And Mr. Yu is here.

317
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,759
I'll go somewhere else

318
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,119
and wait for the event to start.

319
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,319
Why did you have to
arrange an interview?

320
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,799
It's just a short one.

321
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,720
Yu Tu.

322
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,799
Pick a gown for me.

323
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,720
Which one do I look good in?

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,759
All of them.

325
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,359
How insincere.

326
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,240
Come here.

327
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,599
Come and pick one.

328
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,319
This seems heavy.

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,319
I think this is lighter?

330
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,880
I... I'm fine.

331
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,640
Carry on.

332
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,359
Go on.

333
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,799
Your reason for picking this dress

334
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,160
is very unusual.

335
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,440
But these gowns are quite revealing.

336
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,200
You don't mind, do you?

337
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,440
I'm not that narrow-minded.

338
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,319
I'm glad, then.

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,200
But I am narrow-minded.

340
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,559
You can't wear this.

341
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm going to confiscate this.

342
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,359
It's too flashy.

343
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,680
What about my outfit?

344
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,759
Can I change it?

345
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,039
Just wear it for another day.

346
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,319
Just one day.

347
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
It's too flashy.

348
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,279
You're mine anyway.

349
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,079
Right.

350
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,160
I'm yours.

351
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,000
Her boyfriend

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
left the hotel alone.

353
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,480
I suppose he's not joining the event.

354
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,039
Do we go separately or what?

355
00:19:59,319 --> 00:19:59,960
Let's trail the guy.

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,759
I checked.

357
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,720
The jewellery event today

358
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,880
is a brand endorsed by Qiao Jingjing.

359
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,359
It's crazy expensive.

360
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,400
It's the same thing

361
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
but several times more expensive.

362
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,000
Why do the women love buying it?

363
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,279
Do you think that guy

364
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,720
can afford to buy this jewellery

365
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,839
for Qiao Jingjing?

366
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,920
I don't think so.

367
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,799
But he should

368
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,200
thank us.

369
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,200
They are having a secret relationship.

370
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
When we expose their relationship,

371
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,079
Qiao Jingjing will have to admit it.

372
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,240
That may not be the case.

373
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
She may refuse to admit

374
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,119
and chose to break up with him
to avoid suspicion.

375
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,440
That's also possible.

376
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,039
Well then,

377
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,440
we are helping him
to end this relationship for good.

378
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,119
We are doing a good deed.

379
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,640
Hi.

380
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,880
Can I add you on WeChat?

381
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,960
He's not bad.

383
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,319
He dealt with it calmly.

384
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,599
He's used to this kind of stuff.

385
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
What are you doing?

386
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,720
Why are you taking pictures?

387
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,599
I can't help myself.

388
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,119
Look at this.

389
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,200
What do you think?

390
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,599
This will be our token of appreciation

391
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,599
for Qiao Jingjing and her team.

392
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,720
Right?

393
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,279
Does he have a girlfriend?

394
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,240
He looks better than the celebrities.

395
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,319
I have no idea.

396
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,759
He seems to be leaving.

397
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:32,960
Qiao Jingjing's event

398
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,079
is starting soon.

399
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's go.

400
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,119
Hi, everyone.

401
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,599
Good evening to our guests

402
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,599
and the media

403
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,480
that are here to join us tonight.

404
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,119
Welcome to our event

405
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,799
where we admire
the "starlight" together.

406
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,880
First, let's welcome

407
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,359
our brand ambassador,

408
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,720
Qiao Jingjing.

409
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,893
(Jingjing is the best)

410
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
Qiao Jingjing is here!

411
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,519
Qiao Jingjing is here!

412
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,920
Qiao Jingjing!

413
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,039
Jingjing, I love you!

414
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,799
Darling, I love you!

415
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,160
Hi, I'm Qiao Jingjing.

416
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm very glad to be

417
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,480
the brand ambassador for Starlight

418
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,880
and to be able to meet all of you here.

419
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,720
Jingjing, I love you!

420
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,360
(Jingjing is the best)

421
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,960
I'm dying!

422
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,519
My darling looks gorgeous today.

423
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,240
(Jingjing, you're the best!)
Jingjing, you are so pretty!

424
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,160
Jingjing.

425
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,559
Jingjing.

426
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,799
Jingjing.

427
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,480
Jingjing.

428
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,519
Are you one of the media?

429
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,400
You are too far away.

430
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
You can't even make out her face.

431
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,519
You won't get any views

432
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,079
if you put up
this kind of picture online.

433
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,720
That's right.

434
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,559
It's fine.

435
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,400
I just take these photos for fun.

436
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,119
Thank you.

437
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,119
No problem.

438
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,079
Please take some nice pictures

439
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,039
for her.

440
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,680
Okay, don't you worry.

441
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,279
Da Mao.

442
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,319
What is it?

443
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,000
The other reporters

444
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,680
are taking her photos only.

445
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,440
But we are taking photos
of both of them.

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,799
When we put up

447
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,920
these photos online,

448
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,920
our competitors
will all be flabbergasted.

449
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,720
I think I'm at the

450
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,400
perfect spot.

451
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,480
Look.

452
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,079
The photo, the composition.

453
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,839
It's perfect.

454
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,759
He's really good-looking.

455
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,440
We don't even have to label it.

456
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,920
The readers won't be mistaken.

457
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,319
Take more photos.

458
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,559
This is rare. Hurry up.

459
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,600
(Jingjing, you're the best!)

460
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,640
All right. We will have

461
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,720
the guests

462
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,200
facing the audience

463
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,359
and raise their glasses

464
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,279
in celebration of this event.

465
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,519
With this,

466
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,119
our event has reached the end.

467
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,880
Jingjing

468
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,759
and the media may proceed
to the back of the stage.

469
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,720
Thank you.

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,880
Jingjing, Jingjing!

471
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Jingjing, Jingjing!

472
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,279
Jingjing, don't go!

473
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,079
Jingjing, don't go!

474
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,559
I won't go in.

475
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,960
Jingjing, you may get changed first.

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,039
I'll go and get dinner.

477
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,799
Ms. Ling wants to have dinner together.

478
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,960
Sure.

479
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,240
It's your first time
seeing me at a live event.

480
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,160
Do I look pretty?

481
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,200
Yes, you do.

482
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,720
You look gorgeous.

483
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,160
I remember Mr. Yu

484
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,720
is quite good at language.

485
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,799
Your descriptions are unimpressive.

486
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,880
Looking from afar,

487
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,680
you are as bright as the sun
as it shines light on the cloud.

488
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,079
Now you're showing off?

489
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,519
But that's acceptable.

490
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,319
It just sounds a little cheesy.

491
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,680
It's my first time going to your event

492
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,359
but I have a problem.

493
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,359
What's with your fans?

494
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,960
The guys and girls

495
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,880
call you "darling".

496
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,720
They just did it for fun.

497
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,640
Are you jealous?

498
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,720
Not really.

499
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,079
In the end,

500
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,680
you come home to me anyway.

501
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,960
Come home to you?

502
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,559
And then?

503
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,039
To watch you translate the thesis?

504
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,279
♪I'm on a distant and quiet land♪

505
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

506
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,960
I forgot to knock.

507
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,079
I...

508
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,200
I didn't...

509
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
interrupt anything, did I?

510
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,200
Jingjing.

511
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,759
Jingjing.

512
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,480
Jingjing.

513
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,599
Where is she?

514
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm done translating.

515
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,720
Today

516
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,200
you're not reading

517
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
any interview outline, are you?

518
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,200
I have a script to go through.

519
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,240
You can translate it again.

520
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,200
I have no time.

521
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,880
I need to defend my rights.

522
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,720
I just realized I was scammed.

523
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,599
I'm supposed to have three days to date.

524
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,359
But my date

525
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,720
came back at 7 PM yesterday

526
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,400
and she's leaving at 8 o'clock tomorrow.

527
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
So it's actually only a day and a half.

528
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,680
Is this how

529
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,319
mini-apps scams work nowadays?

530
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,799
So what?

531
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,079
Now that I have done it.

532
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,519
I won't return the money.

533
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,000
Usually,

534
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,480
in this case,

535
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,319
the developer

536
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,640
will offer some compensation.

537
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,319
For instance,

538
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,960
open up a new area.

539
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,799
It's surprising to hear this from you.

540
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,119
I didn't know you are such a hooligan.

541
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,960
What are you thinking?

542
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,640
I mean my bedroom.

543
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
And that's being decent?

544
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,240
No.

545
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,880
Is it okay?

546
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,279
You have been away for so long.

547
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,799
I can't wait anymore.

548
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,200
Besides the pillow,

549
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,279
what are the other things
that you can't get used to?

550
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,279
You.

551
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,119
There's nothing I can do about that.

552
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,799
You will get used to it.

553
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,680
How is this pillow height?

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,880
What do you think?

555
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,759
Don't move.

556
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,720
How do you like it?

557
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,119
What about this?

558
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:31,880
No.

559
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,559
I'll make it lower.

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:14,180
