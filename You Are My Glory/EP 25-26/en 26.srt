13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
=Episode 26=

14
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,600
Wake up.

15
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,239
They're hugging.

16
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,839
She's leaving.

17
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,120
She's leaving.

18
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,839
She even gave him a heart sign.

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,040
After taking photos for two days,

20
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,160
even I feel like I've become innocent.

21
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,079
It's true.

22
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,079
I'll edit the videos to make them
look nicer.

23
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,559
We can't make them look obscene.

24
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:11,999
Yes.

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,479
Am I right?

26
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,199
You must edit them well.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,919
You can't bash them.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,719
After observing them
in the past few days,

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,999
I think it's true love.

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
That's hard to come by
for Qiao Jingjing.

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,680
I have an idea.

32
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,719
Later,

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
let's check the identity and background

34
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,999
of this guy first.

35
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,919
When the time comes,
let's expose the relationship first.

36
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,240
Everyone will surely be very curious

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,160
about this man's occupation.

38
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,960
For the second scoop,

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,120
let's reveal the boyfriend's identity.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
Won't this week's hot news

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,719
be ours then?

42
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,880
I think that's good.

43
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,839
Let's do it that way.

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,400
Let's all

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,639
go back and have a good sleep then.

46
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,479
It's Monday tomorrow.

47
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,680
He'll surely go to work.

48
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,320
Let's go.

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,279
He has a very healthy lifestyle.

50
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,599
Not bad.

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,719
But he wakes up too early.

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,159
We almost missed him.

53
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,400
Let's follow him.

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,319
He's coming out.

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,080
Sir.

56
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,039
One pancake.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,719
This handsome guy is quite simple.

58
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:30,839
He's similar to us.

59
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,240
Even that yogurt looks quite delicious.

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm getting hungry now.

61
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,879
I must get one later.

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,140
(Research Room One)

63
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:51,159
Mr. Hu.

64
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,200
Yu Tu.

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,559
Come to my office immediately.

66
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,559
Okay, I'll be right there.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,319
Have some tea.

68
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:00,800
Okay.

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,680
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Hu.

70
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,920
Close the door.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,680
Yu Tu.

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
These gentlemen

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,520
are from the National Security Bureau.

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,559
They have some questions for you.

75
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,559
Answer them honestly.

76
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:23,039
Please have a seat.

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,520
Okay.

78
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,759
All right.

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
Don't be too nervous.

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,159
We just have a few questions.

81
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,920
Last Friday to Sunday,

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,319
who were you with?

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,080
My girlfriend.

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,879
What is your girlfriend's name?

85
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,680
Qiao Jingjing.

86
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,800
That actress, Qiao Jingjing?

87
00:05:59,279 --> 00:05:59,800
Yes.

88
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,319
In the past three days,

89
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,600
she just stayed in your house?

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,160
Yes.

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,399
During one of those days,

92
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,959
she went out to attend

93
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,199
a brand's promotional event.

94
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,199
We went there together.

95
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,160
Didn't you notice

96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
that people were following you?

97
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,399
According to them,

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,639
they've been filming you
for three days.

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
On Monday morning,

100
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,519
they even followed you to work

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,319
and took some videos.

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,759
Then

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,879
they were treated as spies
and got arrested.

104
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,120
National Aerospace Research Institute?

105
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,399
This guy's into scientific research?

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes, I should have guessed.

107
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,079
I checked before,

108
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,559
and those who live in his community

109
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,639
work for the Aerospace
Research Institute.

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,360
It's a confidential unit.

111
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,879
We can't go inside.

112
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,399
We can only take some shots outside.

113
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,559
Just get some materials.

114
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,160
Let me see if the materials are enough

115
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
for the second article.

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,720
Sir.

117
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:58,840
Let me ask you something.

118
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,879
Around the area...

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,199
We're from the National Security Bureau.

120
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,800
Please come with us.

121
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:06,920
Get off the vehicle.

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
What will happen to them?

123
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,879
Since what they told us

124
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,040
matches with what you said,

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
we might need to investigate a bit

126
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,639
and confirm

127
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,680
that there's no problem.

128
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:22,720
Then we'll educate them,

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,600
and they can be released.

130
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,519
We've already confiscated

131
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,559
the photos and videos.

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,399
When youngsters date,

133
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,199
don't go in over your head.

134
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,800
Did you attend
so many confidentiality classes

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,959
in vain?

136
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,559
You weren't cautious at all.

137
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,720
We'll pay attention in the future.

138
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,879
We'll educate them

139
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,600
to let them know what they can do
and cannot do.

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,519
They can't just wander around
taking photos

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,879
outside a confidential unit.

142
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,040
All right.

143
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,160
We'll go ahead.

144
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,160
Sirs.

145
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,959
We'll get going.

146
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,040
Stay here,
there's no need to see us off.

147
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
I'll get to work.

148
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,319
Go ahead.

149
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,199
Come.

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,879
This is a good thing.

151
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,519
This is definitely a good thing.

152
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,879
However,

153
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,999
keep it low-key.

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
Don't publicize it too much.

155
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,319
Of course,

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,280
this is also a very natural thing.

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,759
There's no need
to intentionally hide it.

158
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,319
I understand.

159
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,519
Get to work.

160
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,439
Okay, I'm hanging up then.

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,840
I'll inform Ms. Ling.

162
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,519
It's confirmed.

163
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,079
What about her look?

164
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,559
We have three sets of clothing.

165
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,920
Prepare 15 sets.

166
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,160
As backups.

167
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,759
Right.

168
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,800
The blue label is good.

169
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,800
Hey, Jingjing.

170
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,360
Let me tell you something.

171
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:06,879
Go ahead.

172
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,360
I stayed in Yu Tu's house
when I went back to Shanghai,

173
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,519
and the entertainment reporters
took photos of us.

174
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,559
What? They took photos of you?

175
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,959
That's great!

176
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,040
That's because you two

177
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,559
are usually so open and brazen.

178
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,879
Then what should we do now?

179
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
After they expose you, will we admit it

180
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,519
or neither confirm nor deny?

181
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,040
Listen, my PR plans

182
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
have been ready for a long time.

183
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,399
I have plans A, B, C, D.

184
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,240
I can adapt to the circumstances.

185
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,759
I don't think they'll expose me.

186
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,559
Why?

187
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,480
They were arrested as spies.

188
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:33,800
What?

189
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,720
Isn't that funny?

190
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,519
I wonder which company's
entertainment reporters

191
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,240
got so unlucky.

192
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,840
They went to the gate
of the confidential unit

193
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,120
and took photos randomly.

194
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,280
Can they just take photos

195
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,079
of the Aerospace Research Institute?

196
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
I think they're shocked now.

197
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,920
I'll do it.

198
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,840
Help me with this a bit.

199
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,199
Hello.

200
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,680
Hey, Ms. Qiu.

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,800
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you.

202
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,439
You might not know me.

203
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,559
My name is Dou.

204
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,840
I usually

205
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,079
report on minor entertainment news.

206
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,439
I usually rely on everyone's help.

207
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,240
Mr. Dou, I've heard a lot about you.

208
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:14,280
Don't say that, Ms. Qiu.

209
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Don't say that.

210
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,559
This time,

211
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,519
I called you

212
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,680
mainly to apologize

213
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,440
and thank you.

214
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,480
Last week, Ms. Qiao went back
to Shanghai

215
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,080
and met with a friend.

216
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,879
We

217
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,279
didn't handle matters appropriately.

218
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,200
I didn't expect

219
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,999
that Ms. Qiao's friend
repaid enmity with kindness

220
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,320
and clarified this matter for us.

221
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,440
We all know that.

222
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,159
Loyalty is what matters
in our industry the most.

223
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,759
Don't worry.

224
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,720
We'll stop pursuing this matter.

225
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,960
We definitely won't expose you.

226
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,999
In the future, we definitely

227
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,960
won't film Ms. Qiao again.

228
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,399
Thank you then.

229
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,840
Thank you.

230
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,840
I won't disturb you then.

231
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,360
Ms. Qiu.

232
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,919
In the future, if you need anything,
just call me.

233
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,639
You're too kind.

234
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,440
Bye.

235
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,999
What's going on?

236
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
When can my PR plans

237
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,519
be put to use?

238
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,759
I spent the money already.

239
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,133
(After two years)

240
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,600
All right.

241
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,720
Yes, that D is crooked.

242
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,320
Ms. Ling.

243
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Jingjing is trending again.

244
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,480
She's filming in the desert.

245
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Why is she trending?

246
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Let me do it.

247
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,560
No, during Spring Festival,

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,080
wasn't Mr. Yu in Beijing

249
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,560
on a business trip
at the Aerospace Control Center?

250
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,240
They went to a movie,

251
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,919
and an ordinary citizen
took photos of them.

252
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,799
Wasn't that a few months ago already?

253
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,399
Let me see.

254
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:33,960
Take a look.

255
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,039
All right then.

256
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,679
Thank you.

257
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,136
(Weibo)

258
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,600
(A few months ago,)

259
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,440
(I happened to meet Qiao)

260
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
(and her boyfriend at the movie theater.)

261
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,639
(It's true that her boyfriend is tall.)

262
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,560
(Qiao was wearing a mask.)

263
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,240
(He was also wearing one.)

264
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,320
(I think it was a couple mask.)

265
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
(That kind of mask is a bit cute.)

266
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,639
(Did Qiao force him to wear it?)

267
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,639
(Ha ha ha.)

268
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,679
(I was a coward.)

269
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,999
(I only dared to take side
and back photos of them.)

270
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,680
(Don't believe it without
an official announcement.)

271
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,039
Hey.

272
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,440
Jingjing and Mr. Yu

273
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,759
have been photographed

274
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,679
so many times in the past two years.

275
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,999
Why doesn't she just make
their relationship public?

276
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,360
I don't think she's planning
to officially announce it.

277
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,519
I think it's quite good not to make
an official announcement too.

278
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,879
The PR plan I prepared earlier

279
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,919
is such a thing of the past now.

280
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,480
If she makes a public announcement,

281
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
we must spend more money.

282
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,879
Forget it.

283
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,220
(Aerospace Service Site)

284
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,600
What kind of Internet connection
do we have here?

285
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,440
What are you checking online?

286
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,600
Remember to use an alternate account.

287
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm not checking gossip.

288
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,159
Why should I use an alternate account?

289
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,480
I'm checking

290
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,600
the Weibo of Mr. Yu's planetary rover.

291
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,159
Didn't it land successfully

292
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,039
a long time ago?

293
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,240
But they will

294
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
post some photos from time to time.

295
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,279
Forget it.

296
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,360
Ms. Ling.

297
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,639
It's Ms. Ling.

298
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,999
You're not shooting now?

299
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,360
No.

300
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,320
We're waiting for the sunset.

301
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,159
Is the signal bad on your side,

302
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,200
and you can't go online?

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Don't get me started.

304
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,279
I can make phone calls.

305
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,120
WeChat is fine if you have
some patience.

306
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,799
But it takes a lot of effort
to surf the Internet.

307
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,679
That's why

308
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,279
I especially called to tell you

309
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,960
that you and Mr. Yu are trending again.

310
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,639
Mr. Yu is on a business trip.

311
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,600
We haven't seen each other

312
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,240
for almost a month.

313
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
How can we trend?

314
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,960
A few months ago,

315
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,840
you watched a movie in Beijing,

316
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,759
and an ordinary citizen
took photos of you.

317
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,840
I don't know why

318
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,919
she posted it today.

319
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,720
Then

320
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,799
your fans

321
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,919
don't believe it without an official
announcement, as usual.

322
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,840
People are cursing entertainment
reporters for being useless, as usual.

323
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,639
I am

324
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,999
preparing to get that off
the trending list, as usual.

325
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,960
Everyone's so familiar
with what he's doing.

326
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,919
In the past two years
that you've been dating,

327
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,320
I've done this so many times.

328
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,799
I think

329
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,759
that you two

330
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
should just make it official.

331
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,159
No.

332
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,159
It's not suitable to make it official

333
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,080
due to Mr. Yu's job.

334
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,679
Besides, even if I make it official,

335
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,240
my trending rate might not
become lower either.

336
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,799
And with the way we are now,

337
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,919
at least the public knows

338
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,039
that we really want to keep it low-key.

339
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,799
They'll understand it in the future.

340
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,759
Ms. Qiao.

341
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,960
The director and scriptwriter

342
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,720
will be having a meeting later.

343
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,679
They're inviting you to attend.

344
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,840
Okay, I'll be right there.

345
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay, go ahead.

346
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,879
By the way,

347
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,399
is Zhou Xiaoqi joining the filming set?

348
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,320
I have a scene with her after two days.

349
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,200
Don't get into a conflict

350
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,240
with her.

351
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,639
Do you think I'm a child?

352
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,799
Do you even need to tell me that?

353
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,240
Bye.

354
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,759
I'm hanging up.

355
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:38,600
Rub some on you too.

356
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,159
I'm not afraid of getting a tan.

357
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
Let's move the stuff.

358
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,560
I think Zhou Xiaoqi is here.

359
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,039
She's already here today?

360
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,480
Come on, let's welcome her.

361
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,039
Is there a need to do that?

362
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,639
Everyone knows that you don't get along.

363
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Let's just pass by.

364
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,039
I think you have too much free time
since the Internet connection is bad.

365
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,639
Follow me while walking later.

366
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,639
Don't randomly look around.

367
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,639
I came here today

368
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,159
mainly to familiarize myself
with the environment

369
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,399
and have an idea for the filming

370
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,240
after two days.

371
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,240
Ms. Zhou.

372
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,879
You're so dedicated to your work.

373
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,240
By the way,

374
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,879
I brought some beverages and food

375
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,840
for everyone.

376
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,840
Share it among yourselves.

377
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,840
Come and thank Ms. Zhou.

378
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,560
Here. Thank Ms. Zhou.

379
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,360
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

380
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,200
Come on, let's move these things.

381
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
Does Ms. Qiao

382
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
often treat everyone with these too?

383
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,039
(Reminder number one.)

384
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,799
(Qiao Jingjing and Zhou Xiaoqi
haven't gotten along for many years.)

385
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,879
(You must handle)

386
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,039
(their relationship carefully.)

387
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,840
Well...

388
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,720
Ms. Qiao did as well.

389
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,919
All right.

390
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,279
I'll take you to the director

391
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,960
to say hi.

392
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,600
Sure.

393
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,679
Okay, come on.

394
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,799
Jingjing.

395
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,519
Qiqi.

396
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,159
Jingjing.

397
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,960
It's been a while, I missed you so much.

398
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,240
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,960
It's fine.

400
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,279
I think you were too excited.

401
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,399
You look great.

402
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
After being in the desert for so long,

403
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,399
your skin is still so moisturized.

404
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,560
(I rarely have a pimple,)

405
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,999
(and you saw it so quickly.)

406
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,360
My dear, I miss you so much.

407
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,600
You're finally here.

408
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,120
Did you become slimmer again?

409
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,759
Your waist is so small.

410
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,720
(I only gained 4 pounds,)

411
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,080
(and my waist increased by 2cm.)

412
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,759
(Qiao Jingjing can tell?)

413
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,360
If you kill me,

414
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:29,999
soldiers will still chase after you.

415
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,679
Give me what I want.

416
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,120
Perhaps

417
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,999
your life might be spared.

418
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,759
Stop following me.

419
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,519
Cut.

420
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:46,560
Thank you.

421
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,560
The look in Jingjing's eyes is perfect.

422
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,639
Xiaoqi isn't bad either.

423
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
How did Qiao Jingjing

424
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,759
improve so much?

425
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,039
She's usually so dramatic
and pretentious.

426
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,759
I thought

427
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,120
that she wouldn't be able
to play this character well.

428
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,039
I didn't expect
that once she's in character,

429
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,279
she has great aura.

430
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
She almost suppressed mine.

431
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,159
She still wasn't able
to suppress you, right?

432
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,240
Besides,

433
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,799
I think your acting

434
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,840
is way better than hers.

435
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,639
Xiaoqi, do you want
to check the script

436
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,320
and ponder upon it more?

437
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,440
Xiaoqi.

438
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,039
Mr. Chen said that he wants
to visit you on set.

439
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,600
Really?

440
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
You're coming to visit me?

441
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,560
Ms. Zhou.

442
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,039
You're so thoughtful.

443
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,120
Look, everyone's eating so happily.

444
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,080
If everyone's happy, I'm happy.

445
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,679
There is a lot of delicious food.

446
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,199
Shouldn't we

447
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,320
thank Ms. Zhou?

448
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,040
Not bad.

449
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,159
Let's thank Ms. Zhou together.

450
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,120
This looks extravagant.

451
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,919
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

452
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:04,439
Don't be shy.

453
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,439
Eat more.

454
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,719
Director.

455
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,959
Do you

456
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,560
want to eat something over there?

457
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,320
Go.

458
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,879
Jingjing.

459
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Zhou Xiaoqi's assistant

460
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,360
sent some food over.

461
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,320
Did you thank her?

462
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,679
Of course.

463
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,280
I know my manners.

464
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:47,639
There is a lot of food.

465
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,080
They're all oily and salty.

466
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,239
I can't eat them late at night.

467
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,479
You're still thinking about food?

468
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,280
Aren't you worried at all?

469
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,239
About what?

470
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
Mr. Yu is coming to visit you.

471
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,879
What should I worry about?

472
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,520
I don't have a kissing scene
for this project.

473
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,360
I'm not talking about that.

474
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,679
Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend

475
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,199
came before Mr. Yu,

476
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,600
and he brought so much food.

477
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,000
Barbecue, spicy hot pot, snacks.

478
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,080
And he even invited a chef.

479
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,280
Mr. Yu

480
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,560
can't get defeated.

481
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,959
If you're craving food,

482
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,840
eat.

483
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,000
Don't waste

484
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,800
Zhou Xiaoqi's food.

485
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:28,919
Who's craving food?

486
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm worried.

487
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:34,800
What if

488
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,199
we ask Mr. Yu

489
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,399
to bring stuff for the crew

490
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,800
and reimburse it from Ms. Ling?

491
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,320
We can't lose to Zhou Xiaoqi

492
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
on this aspect.

493
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,120
Xiao Zhu.

494
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:45,959
At a young age,

495
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,479
why are you so competitive?

496
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,800
Don't you always say

497
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,199
that you must be prettier
than Zhou Xiaoqi?

498
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,199
Today, what Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend did

499
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,239
was too exaggerated.

500
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,280
Didn't you notice

501
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,399
that the director was unhappy?

502
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,120
He delayed our filming.

503
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,399
If someone does that again,

504
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,399
the director will be furious.

505
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,959
That's why it's better

506
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,000
for Mr. Yu to come

507
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,760
and leave quietly.

508
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,320
Besides,

509
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
when I usually ask you

510
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,000
who's prettier between me
and Zhou Xiaoqi,

511
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
I was

512
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,120
just joking.

513
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,399
Don't take me seriously.

514
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,719
Why should we compare our boyfriends?

515
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,840
Look at the practice now.

516
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,520
If I want to compete with her,
I'll do it with projects.

517
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,959
Besides,

518
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Mr. Yu

519
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,439
is so smart, talented,

520
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,199
handsome, and chic.

521
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,080
Did I use him to suppress others?

522
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,479
No.

523
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,120
Because

524
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,560
being talented myself

525
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,520
is the most important thing.

526
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,560
That's why it's enough for me
to be prettier than her.

527
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,679
If you didn't use so many adjectives

528
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,600
and that last thing you said,

529
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,000
I almost believed you.

530
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,600
You're right.

531
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:00,679
Don't waste the food.

532
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:05,800
Jingjing.

533
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,800
When is Mr. Yu coming?

534
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,399
In three days,

535
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,760
around 11 AM.

536
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,760
Where is he coming from, Shanghai?

537
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,560
I don't know.

538
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,280
He didn't tell me where he went
on his business trip this time.

539
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,800
I think it's confidential.

540
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,639
Anyway, don't aerospace workers

541
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,199
perform experiments

542
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,159
in places

543
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:21,959
like the Gobi Desert?

544
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,639
When he comes in three days,

545
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,719
I should be filming.

546
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,840
Help me pick him up.

547
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,280
I wonder

548
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
where he'll be coming from.

549
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,600
(I'm still very worried.)

550
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:07,719
(What's the matter?)

551
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,719
(Mr. Yu is coming for a visit today.)

552
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,199
(I'm waiting for him.)

553
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,199
(Isn't that a good thing?)

554
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,280
(Jingjing and Mr. Yu)

555
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
(haven't seen each other
for a long time.)

556
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,320
(But two days ago,)

557
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,080
(Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend
came for a visit.)

558
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,439
(He made a big deal with his arrival.)

559
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,040
(If Mr. Yu comes here empty-handed,)

560
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,679
(they'll surely criticize him
behind his back.)

561
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,600
(I really don't want to see)

562
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,800
(Zhou Xiaoqi's assistant
to look so pleased.)

563
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,600
Xiao Zhu.

564
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,800
It's been a while.

565
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,280
Mr. Yu, it's been a while.

566
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,199
I'll bring you over.

567
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,560
(You might not receive this now,)

568
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
(but I must tell you.)

569
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,919
(It's useless no matter how exaggerated
Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend was.)

570
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
(We won.)

571
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,840
(Mr. Yu's long legs and army boots
made an instant killing.)

572
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,280
Jingjing, I think

573
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,040
we should

574
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,560
do another take of you crawling

575
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,520
and lifting your head

576
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:25,760
in the desert, okay?

577
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,520
The look in your eyes is right,

578
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,439
but I hope

579
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,360
that your entire body movement

580
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,520
has more tension, okay?

581
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,000
Okay.

582
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,520
Thank you.

583
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,399
Thank you, Director.

584
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:51,399
Let's do it when you're ready.

585
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,080
(Production: Sand)
Scene 38, shot 3, take 2.

586
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,399
Cut.

587
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,879
That's a good take.

588
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,159
The director said

589
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:10,959
that we could rest for one hour.

590
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,879
Everyone can relax a bit.

591
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,239
Director.

592
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,600
This one's fine, right?

593
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:16,639
Yes, take a look.

594
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,679
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

595
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,879
It's good, I'm quite satisfied.

596
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,239
All right.

597
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,479
- Thank you, then...
- Okay.

598
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,800
- Rest a bit, okay?
- Okay.

599
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,479
I missed you so much.

600
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,760
Xiaoqi.

601
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,919
Is that Qiao Jingjing's boyfriend?

602
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,560
She doesn't care about people
seeing them at all.

603
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,959
He's so hand...

604
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,199
He's all right.

605
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,439
Isn't he the one

606
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,959
who works at the Aerospace
Research Institute?

607
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
They've been together for two years.

608
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,080
They've been photographed many times.

609
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,520
Let me check.

610
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,360
Does it hurt?

611
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,040
There's sand all over you.

612
00:27:58,919 --> 00:27:59,679
It's fine.

613
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,199
Come on, let's go to the lounge room.

614
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,560
Look at them.

615
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,600
They're in front of so many people.

616
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,159
She's not reserved
like how a female celebrity

617
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:19,879
should be at all.

618
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,120
When my boyfriend came,

619
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,040
did I act that way?

620
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,719
Of course not.

621
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,080
You just stayed in the lounge room

622
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,560
and maintained your poise completely.

623
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,800
Aren't you on a business trip?

624
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,120
How can you visit me?

625
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,760
Is it around the area?

626
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,760
If you can't tell me,

627
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,639
you don't need to.

628
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:43,879
I can tell you now.

629
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,600
I just finished my mission yesterday.

630
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,959
I left this morning.

631
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
You were really in this desert?

632
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,360
Around 200km away.

633
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,560
200km?

634
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,360
It was so near.

635
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,040
It's fine.

636
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
You just didn't come
at a good time.

637
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,280
I have to shoot all day.

638
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,959
And I have one more scene at night.

639
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,199
But tomorrow, I can rest

640
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,199
during the day.

641
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,600
We can go around the nearby area.

642
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,760
Treat it

643
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,840
as a desert tour
paid by the company.

644
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,399
Jingjing.

645
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,280
I must go to the airport

646
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,199
at 6 PM tonight

647
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,800
and return to Shanghai
with my colleagues.

648
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,399
I have a meeting early tomorrow morning.

649
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,040
You're leaving today?

650
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,360
Yes.

651
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,879
I'm sorry.

652
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,639
Why are you sorry?

653
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm busy too, aren't I?

654
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,800
After filming wraps up,

655
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,959
I must take a good rest
for two months.

656
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:20,439
Sure.

657
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:21,760
I should

658
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,120
have more free time then.

659
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,520
Really?

660
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,080
At least I don't need to go
on a business trip.

661
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,280
You haven't eaten, right?

662
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:31,360
I'll ask Xiao Zhu

663
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,639
to get us two portions of lunches.

664
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,000
It's fine.

665
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,239
Let's get down to business first.

666
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,000
Business?

667
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
What business?

668
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:03,639
I...

669
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:07,080
have two more scenes
in the afternoon.

670
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,120
My make-up can't be ruined.

671
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,080
I can do it by myself.

672
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,840
Jingjing.

673
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,840
Is he your friend?

674
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,040
No.

675
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,120
He's a maintenance staff I hired.

676
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,239
Director.

677
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,080
Director.

678
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,439
Go on.

679
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,159
What is he installing?

680
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,959
I don't know.

681
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:04,879
A signal booster.

682
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,639
I know that.

683
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,159
Huang, didn't we install that?

684
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,560
We did, it's that one.

685
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,280
But it doesn't quite work.

686
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,399
It's quite useless.

687
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:15,600
Jingjing told me already.

688
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,600
There are mixed qualities

689
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,800
in the market for this equipment.

690
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,760
You might

691
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
have gotten one with bad quality.

692
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,760
You can remove it later.

693
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,560
A bad quality equipment

694
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,360
isn't of much use.

695
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,919
The base station interference is bigger.

696
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,639
This will work then?

697
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,360
I think so.

698
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,719
I asked my friend who's a specialist

699
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:29,360
to make it.

700
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:30,800
Later on,

701
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,040
if you film in another place,

702
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,800
you can bring it along too.

703
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,280
It's very easy to install.

704
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,820
(Internet speed test)

705
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,253
(Yu Tu)

706
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,879
(I missed you too.)

707
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:53,479
It's fine now.

708
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:57,879
Director, it works.

709
00:32:58,679 --> 00:32:59,439
Really?

710
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:00,919
It really works.

711
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,439
Thank you so much.

712
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,320
You solved

713
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,479
a big problem for us.

714
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:06,919
You're welcome.

715
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,399
I'm doing it for myself too.

716
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,800
It's too long to lose contact

717
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
for over ten hours daily.

718
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,080
Yes, that's a bit long.

719
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,800
Yes.

720
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,320
And Jingjing told me

721
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,439
that you have a lot of
night scenes later on.

722
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:22,199
Yes, that's right.

723
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:24,600
Are you done filming today?

724
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,679
No, we're still filming.

725
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,199
Look, today...

726
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
So what if I have a lot of night scenes?

727
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,399
You can't sleep if you don't see me?

728
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,479
I can't sleep well.

729
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,280
You're such a sweet talker.

730
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,040
Do you want another one?

731
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,520
Huang.

732
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,560
Hurry, arrange for someone

733
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,479
to treat Jingjing

734
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,479
and her boyfriend

735
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,280
to dinner tonight.

736
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,120
Thank them well.

737
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:54,919
All right.

738
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:56,199
Thank you, Director.

739
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,239
But I must reach the airport

740
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,320
by 6 PM tonight.

741
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,120
I must leave at 2:30 PM at the latest.

742
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,959
You're in such a rush?

743
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,000
Hey.

744
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,239
If you're leaving at 2:30 PM,

745
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,840
Ms. Qiao

746
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,879
will shoot a scene at 1 PM.

747
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,120
Then your visit here...

748
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,639
This... This is what we'll do.

749
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,600
Let's push back the afternoon shoot
for an hour.
