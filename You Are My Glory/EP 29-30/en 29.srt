=Episode 29=

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
We've changed the curtains too.

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
That is a nice color.

16
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I know, right?

17
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,719
This color is very hard to get.

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,519
I waited for a month for these

19
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,480
before they arrived.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,319
The ones before

21
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,560
looked too stuffy.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,120
Yu Tu said

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,640
that those didn't easily look dirty.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,879
That's how he is.

25
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,439
Aside from wearing

26
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,439
dark blue,

27
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,680
he wears black.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,759
I didn't touch the book shelves.

29
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,080
I didn't tidy them up either.

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
He knows where he places his books.

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
He'll be annoyed if he can't find them

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,639
because I move them.

33
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,280
That's how he's been
since he was little.

34
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,360
He'd get mad

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,439
if you cleaned them up for him.

36
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,319
Right.

37
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,000
That was why I didn't bother,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,159
and just let him do it himself.

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
The one on the sofa

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,919
is a prize from his unit.

41
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,479
Mrs. Yu.

42
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,599
I bought new tableware.

43
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,719
I'll show it to you.

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,319
Let's ignore him today.

45
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,719
He said that he had to write
a thesis today

46
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,960
and told me to go and have fun
by myself.

47
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,479
Yu Tu.

48
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,080
It's Sunday.

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,840
I don't comment when you usually
work overtime.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,599
But today,

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,000
you must spend time with Jingjing.

52
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,879
She was the one who said that she was
going to read her script this afternoon

53
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,360
and told me to find something to do.

54
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,280
Mom.

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Why do you still believe her?

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,400
Have you fogotten?

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,159
When you first met,

58
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,360
she lied to you already.

59
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,439
Go away.

60
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,919
Write your thesis.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Mrs. Yu, let's check the tableware.

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,319
I'm so sleepy.

63
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,280
I can't do it anymore.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,879
Even the power of love

65
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,479
can't sustain me.

66
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,159
I'll read the script with you later.

67
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,400
I'll answer the phone. Let me go.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,759
During your last film-shooting, they said

69
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,800
that your boyfriend had gone to visit you,

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,479
and Zhou Xiaoqi had been so furious.

71
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,560
Is that true?

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
It's been over a month
since filming was wrapped up.

73
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,360
Where did you hear that?

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,599
I just heard about it.

75
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,000
It's true.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,159
I laughed so hard.

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,759
That feels so good.

78
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,599
When will you

79
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,479
let me meet your boyfriend?

80
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,280
He's talented.

81
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,800
You've been together for so long,

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,439
and you won't let me meet him.

83
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,759
That's not appropriate.

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,719
You speak

85
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,159
as if we met very often.

86
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,039
Let's have dinner when we have time.

87
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,319
How about tonight?

88
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,479
I don't have work today.

89
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,400
I'll tell someone

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,759
to bring hairy crabs over.

91
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,199
The type that weighs 300g each.

92
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,039
That should be fine.

93
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,120
Let me ask him.

94
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,039
It should be fine?
You still need to ask him?

95
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,759
Qiao Jingjing, do you know who I am?

96
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm Chen Xue.

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm very famous.

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,439
I'm very hard to meet.

99
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm inviting him, and he's not coming?

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,040
His girlfriend is also
very famous, okay?

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,399
You think you're all that?

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
He he he.

103
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,399
The Dynamic Solution Method

104
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,000
of Low Thrust Orbit Design.

105
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,600
Chen Xue wants

106
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,240
to invite us for dinner
at her house tonight.

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Do you still remember her?

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
Can I forget her?

109
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,560
She said that I sounded

110
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
like a scumbag.

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,600
Why do you like holding grudges so much?

112
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,879
That was two years ago.

113
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,079
Is tonight fine?

114
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,399
Yes.

115
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,040
Dinner is fine.

116
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
Thank you.

117
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,120
Hey.

118
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll invite Duan Wu

119
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
and Mr. Zhou later too.

120
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,959
That's fine, right?

121
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,519
Sure.

122
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,480
We all know each other well.

123
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,639
They're in Shanghai too?

124
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,079
Yes.

125
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,759
My next film is with them.

126
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,680
I asked,

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,959
and they're still around.

128
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,720
This way, after we have dinner,

129
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,279
we can play mahjong.

130
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,399
No, I won't play that.

131
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,680
I don't know how to play that.

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,199
You just want to win my money.

133
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,160
Listen.

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
I just earned some money in the desert.

135
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,279
Was that easy for me?

136
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,959
Come on.

137
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,399
No.

138
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,439
My boyfriend needs to write a thesis

139
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,759
when he comes back.

140
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,639
Isn't he working already?

141
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,519
Why is he writing a thesis?

142
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,040
Don't you know

143
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,399
how scientific research works?

144
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,920
Yes.

145
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,480
He's doing scientific research.

146
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,399
Right.

147
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,360
We can't

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,439
play mahjong.

149
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,560
That makes us seem like

150
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,879
we don't do decent work.

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Don't worry.

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
Let me handle it.

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll surely make you look good.

154
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,759
Ms. Qiao.

155
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,120
Missus.

156
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,879
You're here.

157
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
Chen Xue is waiting for you.

158
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,439
I'll get you some slippers.

159
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,680
No.

160
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,720
I must save them.

161
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,720
With what?

162
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,480
Those dilapidated starships

163
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,519
in the Star Port?

164
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,480
(Don't worry.)

165
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,759
(We'll surely look)

166
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,399
(very professional)

167
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,639
(and academic.)

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
(Is this what she was referring to?)

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
(Can they stop it?)

170
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
You're finally here.

171
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,160
Jingjing.

172
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,800
Ms. Qiao.

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,399
I haven't seen you in a while.

174
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,199
It's been a while.

175
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,319
I brought my boyfriend over

176
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,079
for dinner.

177
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,800
I know.

178
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,199
Introduce him to us.

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,879
This is my boyfriend, Yu Tu.

180
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,399
This is Mr. Zhou, the best actor.

181
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,639
Hello.

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
I've worked with him before.

183
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,319
This is Duan Wu.

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,000
Nice to meet you.

185
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,480
Nice to meet you.

186
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,199
This is my bestie, Chen Xue.

187
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,279
I've heard a lot about you.

188
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,439
What are you doing?

189
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,639
Next month,

190
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,079
we'll be filming a movie together.

191
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
While we're all here,

192
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
we're going through the script
to get some ideas.

193
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,319
This is a group scene.

194
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,439
We happen to need

195
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,519
one more person.

196
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,360
Can you

197
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,160
help us out, Ms. Qiao?

198
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
Help you out?

199
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,879
Do you mind

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,959
lending us Ms. Qiao

201
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,079
for a while?

202
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,079
Of course not.

203
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,079
Come on.

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,439
(What does your movie)

205
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,759
(have to do with me?)

206
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,360
(Aren't we here for dinner?)

207
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,839
(You tricked me into coming here
for work.)

208
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,279
(Come on, stop dilly-dallying.)

209
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,639
(Your boyfriend is watching.)

210
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,279
(Look academic.)

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
Okay.

212
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,079
Let's do it.

213
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,879
This is

214
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,759
an interstellar theme movie.

215
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,920
This scene is mainly

216
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,120
about the argument between the faction
seeking peace and the one seeking war.

217
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:10,639
Ms. Qiao.

218
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,439
You're the leader
of the peace-seeking faction.

219
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,279
The leader?

220
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,920
He's an old man?

221
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,399
You can do it.

222
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,399
Right.

223
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,160
I can do it.

224
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
A professional old man voice.

225
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,279
Give me five minutes.

226
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,199
Let me memorize the lines.

227
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
Please have some water.

228
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,279
Thank you.

229
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Okay, let's start.

230
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,080
You memorized it so quickly?

231
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,840
Come on.

232
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,759
No.

233
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,679
I must save them.

234
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,639
With what?

235
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
Those dilapidated starships

236
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,919
in the Star Port?

237
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,240
Major, have you forgotten?

238
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,960
The one you're calling a hero

239
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
took away all the elites

240
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
in the Federation.

241
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
Should we

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,919
just be at the mercy of others

243
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,200
and be swallowed up little by little?

244
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,559
That's enough, Major.

245
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,639
Calm down.

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,960
The nation

247
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,679
can't experience another war.

248
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,879
Besides, this is

249
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,240
a war we're bound to lose.

250
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,120
I understand

251
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,600
how a warrior thirsts for battle.

252
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,399
But please also consider

253
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,000
those ordinary citizens.

254
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,799
Sir.

255
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,440
It's not like

256
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
we have no chances of winning.

257
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,360
The science institute's latest weapon

258
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,240
can be installed in the starship.

259
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,480
We need to discuss

260
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,000
how we'll do this part

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,519
of the scene more.

262
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,840
For example,

263
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,919
these.

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
What do you think?

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,960
Don't we seem professional

266
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,080
and literary?

267
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,360
We were playing Dou Dizhu earlier.

268
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,440
When you arrived,

269
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,120
we immediately put the cards away

270
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
and started going through the scenes.

271
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,399
Right.

272
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,480
We quickly got into character
so professionally.

273
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,440
Let me ask you.

274
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,879
Doesn't this

275
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,399
have

276
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,799
an academic vibe?

277
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,759
Isn't this artsy?

278
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,039
We're completely on par

279
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,559
with scientists, aren't we?

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Please.

281
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,879
When we're eating later,

282
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,360
stop how you're acting now.

283
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,039
Continue

284
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,519
that academic vibe earlier.

285
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,679
Please. Thank you.

286
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,000
Of course.

287
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,080
We can maintain

288
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,039
this image

289
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,279
during the meal.

290
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,159
How about another scene?

291
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,120
There's no need.

292
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,799
If we continue,

293
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,679
the academic vibe

294
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,799
will be too forced.

295
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,679
Just have enough of it.

296
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,639
Just enough of it.

297
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,960
What do you think?

298
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,919
Was I good at portraying an old man?

299
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,960
Yes.

300
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,480
However,

301
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,440
your lines earlier

302
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,960
involved

303
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,600
the performance parameters
of a new weapon.

304
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,480
In

305
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,320
an interstellar era,

306
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,279
it's a bit too conservative.

307
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,519
Thank you.

308
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm confident now.

309
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll revise it immediately.

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,960
Afterwards,

311
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,279
can you help me take a look?

312
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,200
No problem.

313
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,279
Let's exchange WeChat Contacts.

314
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,679
Sure.

315
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,159
I'll ask Jingjing to send it.

316
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,080
Okay.

317
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Another question.

318
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,879
When I was writing it,
I already had doubts.

319
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,759
There's a plot

320
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,799
regarding wormhole.

321
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,039
I also want to discuss it with you.

322
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
This scriptwriter is a big shot.

323
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,840
When have you seen him

324
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
being so humble?

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
Your boyfriend is incredible.

326
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,679
And he's so handsome.

327
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
If I say that he's handsome,

328
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
he really is.

329
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,720
And he's so knowledgeable.

330
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,200
No wonder he suppressed

331
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,879
that heir boyfriend

332
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,480
of Zhou Xiaoqi.

333
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,799
I finally know

334
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,200
why you chose him.

335
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,679
I would want him too.

336
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,399
Say that again.

337
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm just

338
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,679
expressing my admiration

339
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,320
for my bestie's boyfriend.

340
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,120
How can I want him?

341
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,519
That's more like it.

342
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,120
You're so petty.

343
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,639
Okay.

344
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,879
Actually, some people in the circle

345
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,759
are bitter about your relationship.

346
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,080
They said that you chose
a government worker

347
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,480
among all of them.

348
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,120
I didn't quite understand before.

349
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
Why didn't you

350
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,039
choose Mr. Su?

351
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,279
Actually, Su Ye

352
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,840
is a good catch.

353
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,440
He just has minor shortcomings.

354
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,759
But men who are handsome

355
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,720
and rich

356
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,519
are all arrogant.

357
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,080
However, come to think of it now,

358
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,759
aside from satisfying our vanity,

359
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,200
there's nothing good about him.

360
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,799
We have money ourselves.

361
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,440
Let's choose someone we like.

362
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,559
It doesn't matter

363
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
how much he earns.

364
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
I didn't choose that at all.

365
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,919
I know.

366
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,360
However, Jingjing,

367
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,360
if you're

368
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,519
not an actress,

369
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,679
and you don't earn that much money,

370
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,799
will you still choose

371
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,279
your boyfriend now?

372
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm so beautiful,

373
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,039
and I work so hard.

374
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,720
How can I not earn any money?

375
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,279
Even if I'm a live streamer,

376
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,440
I'll become rich too, okay?

377
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,440
What if you were unlucky,

378
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,799
and you couldn't earn money?

379
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,679
Are you stupid?

380
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
If that really happens,

381
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,080
I must hold onto him tightly

382
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,559
all the more.

383
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,200
It's a bit bitter.

384
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,440
Why are you so happy?

385
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,919
﻿Because a famous scriptwriter
consulted you?

386
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,519
No.

387
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm happy

388
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,840
because my girlfriend is super smart.

389
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
She's so logical.

390
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,759
Now, you know.

391
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,840
How exactly

392
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,399
did you figure that out?

393
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,039
For example,

394
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,320
you brought

395
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
all their uncooked crabs

396
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,279
home.

397
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,360
Dr. Yu.

398
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,240
Yu Tu.

399
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,679
Tonight

400
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,639
is the basketball semi-final
in the institute.

401
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,840
Someone's leg has got injured,

402
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,759
and he can't play.

403
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,159
Can you play?

404
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,960
I said

405
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,519
that I'd have dinner at home.

406
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
Don't we have new graduates

407
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,799
in the unit?

408
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,039
They're quite tall.

409
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Being tall

410
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,240
doesn't mean that they can
play basketball.

411
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,679
Hu is an example.

412
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,559
Besides, they just joined us.

413
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,960
We haven't played with them yet.

414
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,039
You do it.

415
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay.

416
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,159
I'll inform the one waiting for me.

417
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,480
The one waiting for you?

418
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,399
I'm curious.

419
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,879
A while ago,

420
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,759
Meng mysteriously said

421
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,200
that you had a girlfriend,

422
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,320
and she was very, very beautiful.

423
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,519
Is she

424
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
who you were referring to?

425
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,000
That was what he said?

426
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,799
Yes.

427
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,519
His facial expression made me
want to beat him up.

428
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,720
I don't know why he's being
so mysterious.

429
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,799
It's my girlfriend.

430
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,240
Meng is right too.

431
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,960
She's very beautiful indeed.

432
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,080
My heart

433
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,039
can't take this.

434
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,679
Love is in the air.

435
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,399
Fine, I'll go ahead.

436
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,600
See you at the basketball court.

437
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,960
Hey.

438
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,159
Jingjing.

439
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,720
I won't be home for dinner.

440
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,879
There's a basketball game
in the institute.

441
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,320
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

442
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,799
I marinaded the steak already.

443
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,039
I was originally not part

444
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
of the semi-final.

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,759
Someone has suddenly gotten injured,

446
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,039
and he can't play.

447
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,440
Do you play basketball so badly?

448
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,000
You're just a substitute?

449
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,240
In senior high, I remember you being

450
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,919
the main force in the varsity team.

451
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,039
Ms. Qiao.

452
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm old.

453
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,879
Right.

454
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,960
Mr. Yu, you're already

455
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,159
32 years old.

456
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,240
In high-intensity sports
like basketball,

457
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,679
your stamina surely can't compare

458
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,440
to those young, fresh graduates.

459
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,600
What about you?

460
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,279
I think we're the same age.

461
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:01,679
No.

462
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,960
No, I'm not.

463
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,160
Listen.

464
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
A while ago, a marketing account
even said

465
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,519
that I looked like a young girl.

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,920
Before,

467
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
I was the one who voluntarily
left the team.

468
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,559
Look at them.

469
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,319
They get me as the substitute
once they need someone.

470
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,079
Doesn't that prove

471
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
that my stamina and standard

472
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,079
are stronger

473
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,519
than other youngsters in the unit?

474
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,200
Fine.

475
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
If you don't believe me,

476
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,000
you can come and confirm it yourself,

477
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,440
and cheer for me as well.

478
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,279
(CATC)

479
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,279
Did you bring your ID?

480
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,240
Of course.

481
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,480
There's no time to eat at the canteen.

482
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,720
I bought corn juice.

483
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

484
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,880
Let's go.

485
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,279
Hello.

486
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,519
I'm an employee of Base 158.

487
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,799
This is my girlfriend.

488
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,799
She's here to watch the basketball game.

489
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,559
Here.

490
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,400
Register your information.

491
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,119
You need to fill out the information
of the visitor and the person visited.

492
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,260
(Qiao Jingjing)

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,759
I'm sorry.

494
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm used to wearing this.

495
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,880
You're from Base 158?

496
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:18,759
Yes.

497
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,319
Your girlfriend

498
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,200
is here to watch the basketball game?

499
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,079
Yes.

500
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,400
When you come out,

501
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,440
exchange this for your national ID.

502
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,559
Thank you.

503
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Thank you.

504
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,559
Aren't you hungry?

505
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,759
How can you drink the corn juice

506
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,119
while wearing a mask?

507
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
Meng kept telling people

508
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,359
that my girlfriend

509
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,720
is very beautiful.

510
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,279
I want to officially show you off.

511
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Okay.

512
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll grant your wish then.

513
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,039
You should have told me that you want
to show off.

514
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,599
I just applied make-up base today.

515
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,000
And I didn't wash my hair.

516
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,559
It seems like I just

517
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,440
look half as beautiful

518
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,359
as I can be.

519
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,160
Is that so?

520
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,519
Let me see.

521
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,039
How can it just be half?

522
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
It's at least two-thirds.

523
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
That's enough.

524
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,279
Yu Tu!

525
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,799
I'll hit you!

526
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,640
Yu Tu, where have you gone?

527
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,799
The game is going to start.

528
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,240
I'll be right there.

529
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,920
I've picked up Jingjing by the gate.

530
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,279
Who?

531
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,559
Jingjing.

532
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,519
My goodness.

533
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,039
This is going to be exciting.

534
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,940
(Inspire dreams, fight hard to shine)

535
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,160
Xiao Yin.

536
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,839
I just called Yu Tu.

537
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,759
And he told me
that he had gone to the gate

538
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,000
to pick up that person.

539
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,640
Who?

540
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,720
Speak clearly.

541
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,880
His girlfriend.

542
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,319
Really?

543
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,799
No way.

544
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,839
Is she

545
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,759
the beautiful girlfriend

546
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,759
Meng kept telling us about?

547
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,119
That's great.

548
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,240
I'm so curious

549
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,160
because of what Meng said.

550
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,039
I really want to see how beautiful

551
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,039
his girlfriend is.

552
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
- Hi, Yu Tu.
- Hey, Yu Tu. You're here.

553
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Here they come.

554
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,480
Yu Tu.

555
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,319
Over here.

556
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:28,960
Why does Yu Tu's girlfriend

557
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,559
look so familiar?

558
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,759
Qiao Jingjing.

559
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,160
That's Qiao Jingjing, isn't it?

560
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,880
What's going on?

561
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,240
We invited a female celebrity

562
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,200
to cheer

563
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,279
for our basketball game?

564
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,279
No.

565
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,240
Yu Tu is holding her hand.

566
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Xiao Yin.

567
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,720
His girlfriend is Qiao Jingjing.

568
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Oh my god.

569
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,599
You're so tight-lipped.

570
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,400
Xiao Yin.

571
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,319
Yes.

572
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,240
Mr. Yu, what can I do for you?

573
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,279
I'll let you take care of Jingjing.

574
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,039
I promise to take good care of her.

575
00:20:59,039 --> 00:20:59,599
Hello.

576
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,279
I came to watch Yu Tu's basketball game.

577
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,119
Go ahead.

578
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,640
Go get changed.

579
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,359
Come on.

580
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,559
I'll go get changed.

581
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,200
Come on, move over there a bit.

582
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,759
- Jingjing, sit here.
- Okay.

583
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,200
Let me introduce you.

584
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,880
Jingjing, they are

585
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
our colleagues.

586
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,559
And this is

587
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,920
Yu Tu's girlfriend.

588
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,720
I don't need to tell you her name,
do I?

589
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,480
There's no need.

590
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
Who doesn't know her?

591
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,359
Right.

592
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,079
This is unbelievable.

593
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,680
Right.

594
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,440
Who could have thought

595
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,680
that Qiao Jingjing is the girlfriend

596
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,799
of our colleague?

597
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,319
Actually, it's not that unbelievable.

598
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,720
Yu Tu and I were classmates
in senior high.

599
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,799
So you've been dating since senior high?

600
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,279
I'm sorry. I'm not being nosy.

601
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,480
You don't need to answer.

602
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,039
No.

603
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,000
We studied hard

604
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
during senior high.

605
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,039
We weren't dating.

606
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,039
After many years,

607
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,319
we found out
that we were both still single,

608
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,160
so we just made do with each other.

609
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
Love is in the air.

610
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,359
We don't believe that.

611
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,480
The game is about to begin.

612
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,599
Why are you here?

613
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,799
I feel quite pressured.

614
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,359
I feel like

615
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,039
it would be bad if we didn't win today.

616
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,200
I believe in you.

617
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,839
All the best.

618
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,640
Believe in yourself.

619
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,759
You're old but vigorous.

620
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,240
Old but vigorous.

621
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,119
Oh my god.

622
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,079
Jingjing.

623
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,480
You can do it!

624
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,400
Go!

625
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,839
Hurry!

626
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,119
You can do it!

627
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,680
- Go!
- Go!

628
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,039
Go for it!

629
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,640
- Go!
- Go!

630
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,440
- Go for it!
- You can do it!

631
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
- Go!
- Go!

632
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,279
- Go for it!
- You can do it!

633
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,340
(Base 158, Base 159)

634
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,920
That last three-point shot

635
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
was way too cool!

636
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,920
Am I comparable to youngsters?

637
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,279
It's not comparable to yourself

638
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,640
when you were younger.

639
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
In senior high,

640
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
when you played basketball,

641
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,759
you obviously made more direct attacks.

642
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,759
Now, you just

643
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,960
make three-point shots.

644
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,759
That's obviously because your stamina...

645
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,759
You obviously won

646
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,319
through technique.

647
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
Can't you say something nice?

648
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,519
You're so cool.

649
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,039
I like it so much.

650
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,119
Let's go home.

651
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,440
What do you think?

652
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,160
Is my ID photo

653
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,279
very beautiful?

654
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,920
Let me see if

655
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,519
yours is really

656
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,799
as handsome as you say it is.

657
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,240
Let me compare which one is nicer.

658
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,940
(Qiao Jingjing, Yu Tu)

659
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,319
How can you compare them?

660
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,319
If we want to compare them,

661
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,119
shouldn't we take one

662
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,640
under the same exact conditions,

663
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,799
the same lighting,

664
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,799
the same photographer,

665
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,200
and the same venue

666
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,200
before we can reach a conclusion?

667
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,920
Should we be so strict about this?

668
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,400
Yes.

669
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,279
So,

670
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,160
when will we take

671
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,599
our certificate photo together?

672
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,039
That was a marriage proposal?

673
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,799
Of course.

674
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,079
It's so obvious already.

675
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,359
Let me ask you.

676
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,240
How is that obvious?

677
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,039
So you just agreed

678
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,000
so easily?

679
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,480
Don't tell me you have already
registered your marriage.

680
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,119
How is that possible?

681
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,079
That's good.

682
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,559
I knew it.

683
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,920
Mr. Yu

684
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
isn't an unreliable person.

685
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,400
We're planning

686
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,759
to meet our families next weekend.

687
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,720
That's considered our engagement.

688
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,119
Should I start planning

689
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,680
your wedding?

690
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,039
I guess so.

691
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,720
This matter

692
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,559
must be planned carefully.

693
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,920
The venue, guests,

694
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,440
wedding dress, gifts.

695
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,960
Oh my god.

696
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,279
I'm so overwhelmed
just thinking about it.

697
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,119
Do you have

698
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,160
any thoughts about it?

699
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,079
What kind of wedding do you want?

700
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,599
When do you want to hold it?

701
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,720
Actually, we haven't thought about
all those things.

702
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,359
In terms of the date,

703
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,480
after my next film is done?

704
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,480
Your next drama is only 12 episodes.

705
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,480
You'll finish filming in over a month.

706
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,799
You want to plan a wedding

707
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,759
in just over one month?

708
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,839
Have you gotten married before?

709
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,160
Take a look.

710
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,559
Hainan is so nice.

711
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,519
I think

712
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,640
it's also good to hold

713
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
the wedding in Hainan.

714
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,519
The confidentiality factor will be high.

715
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,440
Right?

716
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,839
But so many people will be going
to Hainan.

717
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,200
It would be very fussy
about mobilizing everyone.

718
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,519
That's very troublesome.

719
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,160
Mrs. Qiao, don't worry.

720
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,440
Ms. Ling will make arrangements.

721
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,000
We'll organize it.

722
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,920
We guarantee that
we'll make proper arrangements

723
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,599
for your relatives and friends.

724
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,279
We can also hold the wedding

725
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,640
in Shanghai.

726
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,519
However,

727
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,799
the confidentiality factor will be low.

728
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:15,920
Am I right?

729
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,519
What about our hometown?

730
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,759
What are your thoughts?

731
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,759
We... We don't have any thoughts.

732
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,640
We'll just do what Yu Tu
and Jingjing want.

733
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,680
Yes, we'll listen to them.

734
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,599
Let's do what Jingjing wants.

735
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,400
Then we won't get the matter settled.

736
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
She's so fickle.

737
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,279
Xiao Zhu.

738
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,440
When other celebrities get married,

739
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,160
once there is a mistake,

740
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,559
they will become trending at once.

741
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,480
"It's too formal." "It's too simple."

742
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Some would comment that way.

743
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,200
They'll also comment
about the gifts given.

744
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,519
We must be careful.

745
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
You must manage

746
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,359
the guests and stuff.

747
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:47,960
Mrs. Qiao.

748
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,400
Don't worry.

749
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,119
Xiao Zhu.

750
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,599
You always call Yu Tu

751
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,519
Mr. Yu.

752
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,640
Why is that?

753
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,000
Because a few years ago,

754
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,720
when Mr. Yu taught Jingjing

755
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,599
how to play games,

756
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,559
that was how we called him.

757
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,440
We're used to it.

758
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,720
That was how Mr. Yu

759
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,240
tricked Jingjing
into being his girlfriend.

760
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
Didn't she tell you?

761
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:07,519
Son.

762
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,039
You were that good?

763
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,039
Mr. Yu.

764
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,079
Your daughter

765
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,640
can't be tricked that easily
in the future.

766
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,599
Mrs. Qiao.

767
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,640
That won't happen.

768
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,799
He must go through me first.

769
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:19,920
At that time,

770
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,640
you'll be a 50 or 60-year-old man.

771
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,240
How can you fight a youngster?

772
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,880
At 80 years old,

773
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,759
I can still make a Penta kill,
don't you think?

774
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,799
Continue bluffing.

775
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,839
Mr. Yu.

776
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,880
I have to drive Jingjing

777
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,160
back to the film set.

778
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,559
I'll get something in Shanghai first.

779
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,160
Then I'll meet up with you in Hengdian.

780
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,960
Okay.

781
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,680
Look.

782
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
It's almost New Year,

783
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,759
and you even accepted
a film-shooting project.

784
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,759
After getting married,

785
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,079
you must take care of your household.

786
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,559
It's fine, Jingjing.

787
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
You can do your work.

788
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,039
At home,

789
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,480
Yu Tu can take good care of himself.

790
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,000
Accept film-shooting works if you want.

791
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,559
If not,

792
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,720
just rest at home.

793
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,599
You don't need to mind him.

794
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,640
It's true. You don't need to mind him.

795
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,680
Mom.

796
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:00,640
That wasn't

797
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,880
what you told me before.

798
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,519
What did I tell you before?

799
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,759
No.

800
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,359
Your mom told me about it.

801
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,680
Look.

802
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,200
Let's just see
what Jingjing wants to do.

803
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,000
Right.

804
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,839
Jingjing.

805
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,839
You call the shots.

806
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,440
So your mom's requirement

807
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
was for her daughter-in-law

808
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,000
to take good care of you?

809
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,119
But when she saw you,

810
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,799
she forgot what she originally wanted.

811
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,319
She's not firm at all.

812
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,799
But what kind of son-in-law

813
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,359
do your parents require?

814
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
Just being handsome is enough.

815
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,559
I fulfilled that once I was born then.

816
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm ignoring you.

817
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,960
There's another successful rocket launch

818
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,240
("Science 20" successfully launched)
at the Taiyuan Launch Center.

819
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,839
(at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center today)
A few days ago, it seemed a rocket

820
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,279
also successfully launched in Jiuquan.

821
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,759
Right.

822
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,720
I think Science 20 was the one

823
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,839
that launched today.

824
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,279
How do you know it so well?

825
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,359
Because I'm following a lot

826
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,880
of your industry's official accounts.

827
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,599
Like CATC,

828
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,400
Shanghai Aerospace,

829
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,079
and also your unit's official account.

830
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,160
Aren't I

831
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,240
the very qualified family member
of a aerospace worker?

832
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,559
You follow a lot more accounts than me.

833
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:21,920
Of course you are.

834
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,000
Do you follow

835
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,559
any official accounts
in the entertainment circle?

836
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,359
I'm sorry.

837
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I didn't do my job well.

838
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,200
Here.

839
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,799
I'll follow them now.

840
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,799
I don't want you to follow them

841
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,839
when you're told.

842
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,599
And lately, I have

843
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,960
a romance drama coming up.

844
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,880
Forget it.

845
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,559
If some official accounts

846
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,519
have some photos

847
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,480
with sweet interactions
with the male lead,

848
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,200
someone might be unhappy

849
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,359
if he sees them.

850
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,839
Is that considered

851
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,960
a romance drama?

852
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,759
You break up at the beginning.

853
00:32:59,319 --> 00:32:59,880
Isn't the story afterwards

854
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,480
about the female lead's career?

855
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,440
Right.

856
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,079
I forgot you read the script.

857
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,079
You were hasty.

858
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,680
But Jingjing,

859
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,039
when accepting film-shooting works,

860
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,400
you don't need to consider me.

861
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,079
It's true.

862
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,960
I'm fine.

863
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,359
All right.

864
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:20,920
I won't

865
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,640
intentionally avoid
sweet scenes and stuff.

866
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,680
It will depend on the script.

867
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,720
One may say that he doesn't mind,

868
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,880
but I wonder who takes the script

869
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,680
and studies it carefully

870
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,960
every single time.

871
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,440
Yu Tu.

872
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:36,759
I just discovered this

873
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,680
from the official account

874
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,759
of your unit.

875
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,680
