14

Why haven't you signed up?

15
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,560
There are only 12 spots left.

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,200
You're about to miss out.

17
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,959
Stop kidding around.

18
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,799
I'm not kidding.

19
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,920
I'm being serious.

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,439
If we participate

21
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,719
in this group wedding,

22
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,319
then we'll be able

23
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,199
to put all our troubles

24
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,360
behind us.

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,879
First of all,

26
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,199
we don't have to worry

27
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,639
about what everyone thinks of us.

28
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,400
We don't even have

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,639
to book the banquet ourselves.

30
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,400
Besides,

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,319
we'll only need to invite

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,639
those closest to us as guests.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,919
If this isn't a dream wedding,

34
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,560
then

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
What will be?

36
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,639
I'm so considerate

37
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,159
that even Ling

38
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,520
would be driven to tears.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,479
Jingjing, roll call!

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Coming!

41
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,199
That's it for now.

42
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,000
Now hurry and sign up.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
I have a filming session.

44
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,599
Okay.

45
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,199
I'll go check it out.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,199
Good luck with your movie.

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
What was that about?

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
Our wedding.

49
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,879
What's it going to be?

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,319
I've never been

51
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,439
to a celebrity wedding.

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,879
Is it going to be grandiose?

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,159
Do I need to wear a suit?

54
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,000
She told me to reserve

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,039
a spot at a group wedding
organized by our unit.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,719
What?

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Your girlfriend is a celebrity,

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,319
and that's what

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,360
she could come up with?

60
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,520
But then again,

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
it really suits you.

62
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,719
Didn't you say to keep it simple

63
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,439
when you took part
in our colleague's wedding?

64
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,599
When was that?

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,439
Years ago.

66
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,400
Well?

67
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,680
Are you going to sign up?

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
No way.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,680
She'll

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,919
change her mind in a few days.

71
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,439
After all, Ms Qiao's plan takes us

72
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,439
from the beach to the grass,

73
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,439
to the hotel,

74
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,919
and to the beach again.

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,919
(Are you off-duty?)

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,319
(Have you signed up?)

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Are you serious?

78
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,599
Of course.

79
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,039
You haven't signed up yet, have you?

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
There are only twelve spots left.

81
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Hurry up and book us a spot.

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,159
You can't change your mind
after you sign up.

83
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,919
Otherwise, you'll waste
spots for others.

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Are you sure

85
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,480
that you won't change your mind?

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,879
Of course not.

87
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
I was a little impulsive that day.

88
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,639
But now the more I think about it,
the more appropriate it is.

89
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,279
Before we talk about appropriateness,

90
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,759
have you even taken

91
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,959
your parents

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,360
and also Ling into consideration?

93
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,079
Will they agree?

94
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,519
Never mind about Ling.

95
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,040
As for Mom and Dad,

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,160
I'll take care of it.

97
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,079
If they agree,

98
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,079
then you'll sign up?

99
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,959
Yes.

100
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,199
I'll go ask them now.

101
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:55,100

102
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,000
The tender

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,279
will be in half a year's time.

104
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,720
And I'm already nervous about it.

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,120
Somehow I didn't even notice that.

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,759
Come on.

107

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,839
I was in the lab.

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,720
Jingjing called us.

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,000
She said, she wanted to join
the group wedding organized by your unit.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
Are you aware of this?

115
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,439
Yes, she told me.

116
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,600
But I don't think it's appropriate.

117
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,680
I see.

118
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,399
Jingjing

119
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,480
made several calls

120
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,720
to tell me this.

121
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,560
At first,

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
I firmly disapproved of it.

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
But somehow,

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
she won me over.

125
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,480
Haven't you

126
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,839
agreed with her about this?

127
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,879
I thought you wouldn't agree.

128
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,600
You see,

129
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,560
We and Jingjing's parents

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
sat down for a meal

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,879
just to talk about this.

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,759
And then,

133
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,040
she won over her parents too.

134
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
They were kind of pleased.

135
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,399
My boy.

136
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,240
If you have any

137
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
reservations about this,

138
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,959
you can talk it over with her.

139
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,879
Yes, Mom.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800

141
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,680
Aren't you joining us for dinner?

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
We've got overtime.

143
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,480
You guys go ahead.

144
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm going home.

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,519

146
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,959
is ditching his overtime today.

147
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,560

isn't she?

Jingjing,

160
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,319
if you're getting married,

161
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,800
what kind of wedding do you want?

162
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,680
My dream wedding

163
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,079
should be

164
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,639
a very, very romantic one.

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,079
I'll have the ground
littered with flowers,

166
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,000
invite lots and lots of friends,

167
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,800
and we'll all sing and dance together.

168
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,279
I'll wear a white wedding dress,

169
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,879
and gradually walk towards the groom,

170
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,319
Then he'll hold my hand

171
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,279
(and put a ring on me,

172
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,279

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,759
You've dreamt

192
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,759
of a very romantic wedding

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,159
littered with flowers.

194
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,480
And lots and lots of friends will be invited.

195
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,200
Wait.

196
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,679
When did I say that?

197
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,600
Two years ago.

198
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,559
When you were interviewed
as a jewelry spokeswoman.

199
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,600
You fell for that?

200
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,960
When they asked me

201
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
during the interview,

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
I had to make up an answer on the spot.

203
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,720
Then what kind of wedding do you want?

204
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,840
Yu Tu.

205
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,759
Do you think that

206
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,679
I'm concerned about your finances,

207
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,440
so I came up
with the group wedding?

208
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
Jingjing.

209
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,000
I also want to do the best I can.

210
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,559
Thank you.

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm about to marry you.

212
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,279
Of course you have to do your best.

213
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,480
But for now,

214
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,879
all I really need

215
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,200
is just a simple wedding.

216
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,080
You know that

217
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm at the center of attention.

218
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,000
You must consider many things

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
if you want to get married.

220
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,759
If you want to keep it secret,

221
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,039
then it's hard

222
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,039
to get it done.

223
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
I want to invite

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
only a few close friends.

225
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,879
But someone will resent it eventually.

226
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,120
So in the end,

227
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,919
our wedding may be a social gathering.

228
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,320
We have to keep socializing,

229
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,519
toasting,

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,039
taking photos.

231
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,720
There may be a tiny hitch

232
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,279
that might end up trending.

233
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,960
But if we participate

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,039
in your unit's wedding,

235
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,159
such problems will no longer exist.

236
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,480
By then,

237
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,279
we'll be but a pair of newlyweds,

238
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,279
albeit with many more newlyweds.

239
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,240
So what?

240
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,559
There're so many

241
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,200
people getting married every day.

242
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,120
We are just

243
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,960
an ordinary couple

244
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
amongst them all.

245
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,039
A young couple.

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
But I think that

247
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
belongs to both of us.

248
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,960
Just you and I.

249
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,519
No disturbance.

250
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,559
No social media.

251
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
A wedding is between two people.

252
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,440
From you to me,

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,279
and from me to you.

254
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,399
I hope you don't mind

255
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,240
having such a wedding.

256
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,120
Jingjing.

257
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,080
I suddenly felt

258
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,399
that my previous proposal

259
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,480
wasn't very formal.

260
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
It was a bit rash.

261
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,399
I want to do it again.

262
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,279
To propose to you formally.

263
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,960
I didn't think so, but...

264
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,840
All right.

265
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,960
Qiao Jingjing.

266
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,600
We have known each other
for almost 16 years.

267
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,440
Because of my prejudices,

268
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,399
we have missed 13 years.

269
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,120
You may not regret it,

270
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,039
but I do.

271
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,440
Fortunately,

272
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,879
we still have decades ahead of us.

273
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,240
Please leave the rest of your time

274
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,360
to me.

275
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,320
With diligence...

276
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,480
and best effort,

277
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,120
I will be a good husband.

278
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,919
Good.

279
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,639
I will be good too.

280
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,519
Thank you.

281
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,679
Come in.

282
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,039
Ms. Wang?

283
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,759
Dr. Yu.

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
What brought you here?

285
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,200
Ms. Wang,

286
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm here to sign up

287
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,200
for the group wedding.

288
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,480
Dr. Yu.

289
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,279
Well...

290
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,679
Do you

291
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
have a new girlfriend?

292
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,399
No.

293
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,720
Here's the form.

294
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,320
And the pen?

295
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,639
Thanks.

296
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,639
Yu Tu,

297
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,799
come to my office.

298
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
Mr. Zhang.

299
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,480
Yu Tu.

300
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
Come on in.

301
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,879
Take a seat.

302
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,279
Well...

303
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,919
Have you not...

304
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,639
No.

305
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,120
What?

306
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I don't have a new girlfriend.

307
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,320
I wasn't about to ask you about that!

308
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
If you had a new one,

309
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
would the folks at that department

310
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,720
have called me about it?

311
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,480
I was about to ask you.

312
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,519
Do you have

313
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,879
any trouble

314
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,240
turning around

315
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,480
your finances?

316
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,919
If that troubles you,

317
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,720
my wife and I can help.

318
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,519
Thank you.

319
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,799
But I'm doing fine.

320
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,240
Jingjing and I,

321
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
we just want to make the wedding

322
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,320
a little simpler.

323
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
Did she agree to that?

324
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
She suggested it.

325
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
She suggested it?

326
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,320
She's been...

327
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,679
rather mischievous.

328
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:45,799
However,

329
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,399
she wants to keep things simple.

330
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,240
She thinks she'd get away from the media

331
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,639
if we hold it in the institute.

332
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,600
I know, that can't be possible.

333
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,840
So last night,

334
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,039
we discussed

335
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,720
that if it couldn't be kept secret,

336
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,159
then

337
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,399
it'd probably affect

338
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,679
my colleagues.

339
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,399
So we would back out.

340
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,879
That was what

341
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,359
I told

342
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,519
the secretary just now.

343
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,119
Keeping your nuptials a secret?

344
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,440
That's not a problem.

345
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
We are the best

346
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,799
at keeping secrets.

347
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,440
By then,

348
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,079
you'll show up

349
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,920
after the wedding ceremony

350
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,880
begins.

351
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,079
But what if

352
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,680
the secret was leaked midway?

353
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,720
What would you do?

354
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,640
Surely the wedding
won't be held in the institute.

355
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,319
It should be in a nearby hotel,

356
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,839
just like it's always been.

357
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,559
So it may not be kept secret.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,880
So it's not in your unit, then?

359
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
If someone finds out,

360
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,039
we'll just run away?

361
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:42,799
See,

362
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,759
that's the benefit
of joining a group wedding.

363
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,880
If we hold our own wedding,

364
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,279
we can't run anywhere.

365
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,640
Then,

366
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,079
I'll have to get myself
a pair of sneakers.

367
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,680
And so will you.

368
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,119
I'll just get us one pair.

369
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,799
You'll carry me on your back?

370
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,440
Then I'll have to order

371
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,119
a 50-kg wedding dress.

372
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,440
Can you cut it down to half?

373
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,039
Make it 25 kg.

374
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
12.5 kg?

375
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,000
Plus me, that makes 100 kg!

376
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,440
I need to eat more.

377
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,839
It depends on when it gets leaked.

378
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,519
If it's early,

379
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,359
we'll switch plans.

380
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
If

381
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
the leak happens

382
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,640
only during the wedding....

383
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,000
We'll flee right away.

384
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,440
Once you're done hosting,

385
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,559
find another place

386
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,240
so we'll hold a second ball.

387
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,799
What are you kidding?

388
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,759
This is a wedding,

389
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,920
not a guerrilla gig!

390
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,440
This is simply nonsensical.

391
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:48,920
Mr. Zhang.

392
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,759
Have some water.

393
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,599
You're so sly.

394
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,319
You're setting me up?

395
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,279
Yu Tu.

396
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,640
At last,

397
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,200
you've completed

398
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,680
the most important event of your life.

399
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm so happy for you.

400
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,039
Ms. Qiao is a fine young lady.

401
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,839
From now on,

402
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,000
you must treat her well.

403
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
I will.

404
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,060
(One month later)

405
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,500
(Love is in the Air)

406
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,839
(Shanghai Aerospace 10th Youth Group Wedding)
Families to the air show, get on the bus here.

407
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,759
We're about to set off soon.

408
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,960
They're coming now?

409
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,480
The bride is still wearing a veil.

410
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,400
No one seems to notice them.

411
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,079
Let's leave them alone.

412
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,119
Why are there some brides

413
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,359
who haven't put on their makeup?

414
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
Fix this for me.

415
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,960
There you go.

416
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:16,880
Okay.

417
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,559
There are so many people.

418
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,279
Are you nervous?

419
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,799
A little bit.

420
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Give me your hand.

421
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Are you still nervous?

422
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,559
I'm feeling much better.

423
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,759
Thank you.

424
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,400
Mr. Yu,

425
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,480
Ms. Qiao.

426
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,319
If you

427
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,279
need anything,

428
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,160
call me.

429
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,160
We've been

430
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,200
having our pictures taken outdoors.

431
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,160
Come in and take a rest,

432
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440
and enjoy the atmosphere.

433
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,799
You don't have to mind us.

434
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,079
Okay.

435
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,599
We only found out today

436
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,279
that you're here for the wedding.

437
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm really surprised.

438
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
But don't worry.

439
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,720
All our staff

440
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,880
will keep your secret.

441
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,000
Thank you.

442
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,039
I appreciate that.

443
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,759
As it should.

444
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
Are we going to gather up

445
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,079
at 10:28 later

446
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,880
to head for the banquet hall?

447
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Yes.

448
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,720
(A Match Made in Heaven)
You haven't taken part in the rehearsal?

449
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,759
Then do you need me to explain

450
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,079
the whole wedding process

451
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,799
all over again

452
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,720
once you're in the hall?

453
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,039
Don't worry, I got that covered.

454
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,759
I have a lot of experience in this.

455
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,240
I will take good care of Mr. Yu.

456
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,000
I have BDS.

457
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,640
So it's okay.

458
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,480
Then you may excuse me.

459
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,640
We're expecting

460
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,319
a team of makeup artists

461
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,519
who seem to be late.

462
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
They'll be here as soon as they can.

463
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,559
What's going on?

464
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
I called them.

465
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,640
The makeup artists' ride

466
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
crashed into another vehicle.

467
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,640
Are they all right?

468
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes.

469
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,880
But they're slightly injured.

470
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,799
So they won't make it.

471
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,839
So we're four makeup artists down.

472
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,079
Are we able to cope with it?

473
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,880
It's too late to find substitutes.

474
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,759
Well...

475
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,440
Go ask the hotel

476
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,359
and see what they can do.

477
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,079
All right.

478
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,519
We have a problem.

479
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,000
You see,

480
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,319
the makeup artists
we originally appointed

481
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,279
suddenly could not make it.

482
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:23,880
So now,

483
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,000
we're four makeup artists down.

484
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,440
So I'd like to ask

485
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,680
if anyone can volunteer

486
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
to be our makeup artist.

487
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,559
Can any brides apply makeup
on their own?

488
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,880
I don't usually wear makeup.

489
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm not even good at makeup.

490
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,559
I'm no match for a makeup artist.

491
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,359
Besides,

492
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,519
Our marriage is such a big deal.

493
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,599
How can you suggest that?

494
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,680
It's okay...

495
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,119
Will we make it

496
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,640
if we get our other makeup artists
to speed up?

497
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,799
It's definitely too late.

498
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,000
Sorry.

499
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,960
I'll think of a way.

500
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,279
Do you guys

501
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,559
need a makeup artist?

502
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,680
I brought over a team.

503
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,440
Hello.

504
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
We are Ms Qiao's

505
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,319
makeup team.

506
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,440
May I ask who are the brides

507
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,519
that need us to make up?

508
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,039
These four.

509
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,720
Some grooms also need
to be tidied up a bit.

510
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,160
Will we make it?

511
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,119
The wedding will begin

512
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,079
in one hour.

513
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,880
The brides are very beautiful.

514
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,119
Of course we'll make it.

515
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,279
Thank you.

516
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,039
You're welcome.

517
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,119
Yu Tu?

518
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,000
Mr. Wang.

519
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,720
You're part of the group wedding?

520
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,640
No way.

521
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,839
Your girlfriend's a celebrity, right?

522
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,480
I don't suppose you're a best man?

523
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,960
Today

524
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,200
I'm a groom too.

525
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,839
Congratulations.

526
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,759
It's Qiao Jingjing.

527
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,279
Qiao Jingjing? Where is she?

528
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,519
Let's get out of here.

529
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,000
Are Mom and Dad here?

530
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,319
Not yet.

531
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,759
Then where are we going?

532
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,160
You said it yourself

533
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,359
that we'd run if we were spotted.

534
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,720
Three...

535
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,640
two...

536
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:45,960
one.

537
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,799
Do we really have to run?

538
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,119
My parents will kill us for this!

539
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:54,880
We're not running.

540
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,880
Suddenly, I've gotten a little nervous.

541
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,799
What if I made a mistake in the process?

542
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,599
Let's go to practice again.

543
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,400
Come on.

544
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
Is this it?

545
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,047
(A Match Made in Heaven)

546
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:46,759
Yes.

547
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,119
We'll tie the knot inside.

548
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,200
Let's start rehearsing.

549
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Before the wedding,

550
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,039
a staff member

551
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,279
will bring us here.

552
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,000
And then, one couple after another

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,160
will be admitted in order.

554
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,799
We are the last newlyweds

555
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,720
to enter.

556
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,119
Are we too far behind?

557
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,839
No.

558
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,480
I've always been the last on stage.

559
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,559
I thought so.

560
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,480
All right.

561
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,680
Let's go in.

562
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,440
So romantic!

563
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,519
This runway is in the shape of a spoon.

564
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,960
It's the Big Dipper.

565
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,640
You are now stepping on

566
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,920
its Alkaid star.

567
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,559
If I walk right down,

568
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,079
will the other six stars shine?

569
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,480
They'll light up wherever you walk.

570
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,119
Your aerospace people

571
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,079
are so romantic!

572
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,519
Who came up with this?

573
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,960
Those in charge created a group

574
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,799
from our unit.

575
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,240
I added it under my alternate account.

576
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,640
We all selected the cosmic theme.

577
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,480
But this runway,

578
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,799
I designed it.

579
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,279
It was you?

580
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,640
I don't believe it.

581
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:13,839
When I said

582
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,279
that I'd plan my own wedding,

583
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:15,599
did you not

584
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,119
think of anything?

585
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay, stop running around.

586
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Let's hit the stage.

587
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,720
Next,

588
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,559
we'll walk on the stage together.

589
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
We will stand here.

590
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,240
Looks like you've memorized it all.

591
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,480
You don't need me to navigate.

592
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,400
Today, I am your

593
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
BDS.

594
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:03,920
And then?

595
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,799
Then...

596
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,960
the emcee will announce...

597
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,359
that the wedding officially begins.

598
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240
My mentor...

599
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,680
will witness our marriage.

600
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,799
Today,

601
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,360
(Shanghai Aerospace 10th Youth Group Wedding)

602
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,759
(Shanghai Aerospace 10th Youth Group Wedding)
it is a great honor for me

603
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,440
to witness the marriages

604
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,039
of twelve new couples

605
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,119
from Shanghai Aerospace.

606
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,480
We have a huge crowd...

607
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Our parents,

608
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
relatives and friends,

609
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,839
will watch us from the audience.

610
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,240
That is,

611
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,000
to meet

612
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
our beloved

613
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,079
life partners

614
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,039
who support each other.

615
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,839
We desire

616
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,279
a stargazer's romance.

617
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,599
We also desire

618
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,480
a well-grounded

619
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,119
happiness.

620
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:55,839
Next,

621
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,559
we'd like to invite
our newlyweds on stage

622
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,599
to face each other.

623
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,079
(A Match Made in Heaven)
We'll exchange rings...

624
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
and recite our vows.

625
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,599
Together we will shoulder

626
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,119
the responsibilities and obligations

627
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,559
that come with our marriage.

628
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,640
To honor our parents.

629
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,880
To honor our parents.

630
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,000
To teach our children.

631
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,440
To teach our children.

632
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
To respect and love each other.

633
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,880
To respect and love each other.

634
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,920
To trust and encourage each other.

635
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,319
To trust and encourage each other.

636
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,160
(A Match Made in Heaven)
And to fulfil our marriage.

637
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,559
Finally

638
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,839
I may hug you...

639
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,640
and tell you...

640
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,920
that I love you.

And it's in a group wedding.

659

No way.

660
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,160

That's not something you get every day!

666

But it's so low-key.

671
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,400
It must be true love.
