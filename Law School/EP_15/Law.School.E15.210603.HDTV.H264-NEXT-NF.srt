FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,688
"Once the media begins to report
on one's charges,

7
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:29,274
it will plant presupposition and bias
on the judges.

8
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:32,068
This damages
the defendant's right to a fair trial."

9
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,655
"The defendant may be innocent,
but the damage cannot be restored."

10
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:37,115
We should assert…

11
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,411
What's wrong? You don't like that?

12
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:42,745
APPLICANT: JIN HYEONG-U

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,665
Why? It's well-written.

14
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:48,251
This seems good enough
to be up against Prof. Kang Ju-man.

15
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,212
I get that you'd rather have
Prof. Yang write this,

16
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:53,089
but he said he can't do that.

17
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,425
So why can't he do it?

TESTIFIER STATEMENT

23
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,658
How can you be Prosecutor Jin's testifier?

24
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:23,536
My opinion is that it's unconstitutional.

25
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,247
Then why were you so keen
on having Jin indicted?

26
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,999
I needed to get him in court.

27
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,917
You did what I couldn't do.

28
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:31,919
You weren't helping me.

29
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,005
You used me to get what you wanted.

30
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,006
"Used"?

31
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:38,301
You knew if Jin gets indicted,
he'd request a constitutional review,

32
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,344
and used me, right?

33
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:41,763
-If you shared your intention--
-My intention?

34
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,682
What's my intention?

35
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:49,771
My father passed away

36
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53,358
due to his publication of my dad's
suspected crime, but you--

37
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,984
It's yours to prove on the trial.

38
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:57,320
It must be found constitutional
for the trial--

39
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:58,988
Then you shouldn't be here now.

40
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:03,201
Prosecutor Jin and I
won't be an easy fight.

41
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,002
THIS ARTICLE CONTRADICTS
THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY

42
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:14,879
AND MUST BE ABOLISHED

43
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,734
Is that enough to convince the judges?

44
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,739
If publication of suspected crime
is allowed,

45
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,200
they say it contradicts
the presumption of innocence.

46
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,786
It's not to break
the presumption of innocence.

47
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:50,039
The people commissioned us
as investigative authorities,

48
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:52,583
so it's only natural for us to disclose

49
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,502
the suspected crime
after an investigation.

50
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,545
Especially when…

51
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:59,048
a key presidential candidate
such as Ko Hyeong-su

52
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,341
or other high officials

53
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,677
are investigated
for crimes and corruption…

54
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,140
the people should absolutely have
the right to know.

55
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,227
Now that's a good argument.

56
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,694
Is this why you made me

57
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:21,279
the first prosecutor in Korea

58
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:24,740
to be indicted for violating
Article 126 of the Criminal Code?

59
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:28,119
A constitutional review
can be requested only with a trial.

60
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,830
How did you know
I'd request a constitutional review?

61
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:32,415
I would've done the same.

00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:46,471
His internship is over.

66
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:49,599
Don't contact my student in secret
and make him rat on them.

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,101
POWER OFF

68
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,854
What was that? Did he hang up?

69
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,690
He needs to know that we know.

70
00:03:57,773 --> 00:03:59,108
Squeak, squeak.

71
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:03,946
Not everyone can be a spy,

72
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,240
and you aren't cut out for that.

73
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:08,159
What do you mean?

74
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:10,036
I bet everyone thinks it's you.

75
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,079
You wrote Seung-jae's complaint, too.

76
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,207
It was a part of my internship.

77
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,541
I had to do as he asked.

78
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,710
I get that you want to be a prosecutor

79
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:20,004
and made a mistake
trying to be on his good side.

80
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:22,006
But still, Prosecutor Jin?

81
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:25,885
Sol.

82
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,346
I don't know why I did that.

83
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:31,641
I'll take care of this, so--

84
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:33,184
You can leave the study group.

85
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:37,230
Then he'll have no reason to use you.

86
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,273
Joon-hwi.

87
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,609
How can you say that to me?

88
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:45,112
You of all people can't say that to me.

89
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,614
Why do you think I did that?

90
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:48,199
During the internship,

91
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:51,285
the guy who passed the second round
got all the attention.

92
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,205
I was practically invisible next to you.

93
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:58,501
I'm not the type who doesn't get noticed,

94
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,629
but next to you, I was just…

95
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,381
I get how you feel.

96
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:06,425
I've also suffered enough
with smarties at home and at school.

97
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,302
Only you get me.

98
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,554
Stop talking, and take care of this.

99
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:12,932
You said only I get you, right?

100
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,517
Then do me a favor.

101
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,477
Okay, shoot away.

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,021
It's about that absurd vlog you film.

103
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,147
My vlog?

104
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,065
Yes.

105
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:25,027
What would've happened had the facts
about Lee Man-ho's sexual assault case

106
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:27,446
been published
through the proper channels?

107
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,283
He would not have been ruled
"feeble-minded" so easily,

108
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:34,370
and we could've prevented the verdict
which the public at large deemed unjust.

109
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,955
He oddly has a point.

110
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,792
Politicians who applaud publication
of allegations involving their opponents

111
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,669
and lash out when it happens to them

112
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:44,588
should no longer be allowed
to take advantage of the provision.

113
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:48,092
When did Ji-ho find out
Prof. Yang is his testifier?

114
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,885
He didn't say anything to us?

115
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:56,851
Article 126 of the Criminal Code
could not keep your father safe.

116
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:00,688
Who do you think benefits the most
from this law?

117
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:04,525
No other countries

118
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:09,280
have such a general and broad provision
against publication of suspected crime.

119
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:11,490
Regarding similar cases
in other countries,

120
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:15,411
Ms. Erica Shin, a lawyer
and comparative law expert at Harvard

121
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:18,581
who was also selected as a witness,
will virtually join us.

122
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,833
Are we ready for this video call?

123
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,670
He betrayed us to help Prosecutor Jin.
And what's all this fuss about?

124
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,839
They won't win anyway.

00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:19,141
She totally made me do this.

132
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:21,352
Hey, doesn't this mean it's a huge hit?

133
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,896
I'm frightened.

She asked me not to.

137
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,785
She said she'd call you in time
and asked me to stay quiet.

138
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,037
"In time"?

139
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,875
When is that time?

140
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:54,176
I believe it's now.

141
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:04,228

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,938
<i>It's me.</i>

<i>Criminal Code Article 126</i>

154
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:53,194
<i>I was about to call you right now.</i>

155
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:55,821
<i>Do you have any money?</i>

156
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:56,822
Money?

157
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:59,575
What makes you think I have any money?

158
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,827
I'm living off a line of credit.

159
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,580
<i>Can you take out some cash</i>
<i>from that account then?</i>

160
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:08,375
<i>My landlord wants to raise the rent.</i>
<i>What can I do?</i>

161
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,169
<i>Otherwise, we'll have to move out.</i>

162
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:16,717
Who knew Sol had a twin sister?

163
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,260
They look the same.

164
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:20,095
Hey.

165
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,975
They only look the same.

166
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,435
She went to Harvard Law.

167
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,604
She's not in her league with that career.

168
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,523
Anyway, why is she named Erica Shin?

169
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:32,399
Sol looked surprised, too.

170
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,734
Did you know?

171
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,070
Don't get curious. You'll get hurt.

172
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,446
Hold your horses.

173
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,866
I'm starting to get scared.

174
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:45,037
If you're that scared, take it down.

175
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,414
No, he's about to get the silver medal.

176
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,042
You're at 100,000 subscribers?

177
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,294
He had a good reason
when he uploaded that video

178
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:53,921
as if he was forced.

179
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:57,508
What I'm really curious about
is Ko's response.

180
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,512
The video blew up like this,
but why is he as quiet as a mouse?

181
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:04,306
He was in the media,
so he probably put an embargo on this.

182
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,517
And he won't take a legal measure.

183
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,104
He can't sue him for spreading falsehood,
but I thought he'd threaten him.

184
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,939
Did you see the bulletin?

185
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,986
Someone raised an issue
on how Yeong-chang came to the dorm.

186
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,866
What? No way.

187
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,827
They're saying we should kick her out
and have her punished.

188
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,786
They're furious.

189
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,079
Hey, don't look.

190
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:28,706
They want all of you,

191
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:32,001
from Ye-seul, who gave him a key,
to Sol and Joon-hwi, who let him go

192
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,002
although you knew.

193
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,755
But why did this suddenly resurface…

194
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,968
He wasn't staying quiet.

195
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,643
MOM

196
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:53,731
MOM

197
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:54,940
<i>I sent you some tonic.</i>

198
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:57,401
<i>You'll compete</i>
<i>in the Justice Mock Trial, right?</i>

199
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:02,156
This was delivered.

200
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,991
HERBAL TONIC

201
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,284
I'm throwing it out.

202
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,619
Why? It must be expensive.

203
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,370
You can have it then.

204
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,748
Again?

205
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,884
While you were busy
stabbing the kids in the back,

206
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,178
they also caused huge trouble.

207
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,638
Take a look.

208
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:29,099
RELAY VIDEO:
EXPOSING ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

209
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,435
If they want to make a case
against Ko Hyeong-su,

210
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,145
they should at least buckle up.

211
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,147
You can be their help,

212
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:38,609
just as you saved me
by making Ko abandon Lee Man-ho.

213
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,736
That happened by chance.

214
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:45,032
Assemblyman Ko was the one
who sent Lee's son to the U.S.

215
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,034
I gave him the Lee Man-ho Act

216
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,536
in exchange for the life of Lee's son
as James.

217
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,497
He's living a good life as James now.

218
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,001
If Ko Hyeong-su didn't ask James
to send them his recent photo…

219
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,169
Your photo?

220
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,047
Okay. Let me call you back.

221
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,592
I wouldn't have known that Lee Man-ho
had been in contact with Ko.

222
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:07,680
I had no idea why he broke his promise
to never talk about his son again

223
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,933
and wanted to make a deal
with a man like Lee Man-ho.

224
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,852
What if the world finds out

225
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:17,648
you made a deal with Lee Man-ho
after you enacted the Lee Man-ho Act?

226
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:20,859
You threatened him? That's unlike you.

227
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:23,612
To get Ko to abandon Lee Man-ho?

228
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:24,905
Threaten him?

229
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,324
I gave him a warning
disguised as a piece of advice.

230
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:35,791
So he got scared Lee Man-ho will talk
and took the bait.

231
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,045
<i>How could he do anything like this</i>
<i>as a human?</i>

232
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,422
-Darn it!
<i>-I wish to have…</i>

233
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,094
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,
you can't do this to me!

234
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:50,389
He was suffocated by him,
then the news was all over the media.

235
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:52,891
At that point,
it doesn't matter what Lee says.

236
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:56,437
Ko Hyeong-su can easily say
he's talking nonsense

237
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,896
due to his grudge against him.

238
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:00,566
And who would the people believe?

239
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,526
Lee Man-ho knew that.

240
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,112
That's why he kept quiet,
trying to make a deal with Ko.

241
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:08,699
But I pried for his connection
and tried to make a deal on his sentence.

242
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:11,368
So in the end,
Ko Hyeong-su got rid of him.

243
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,619
That jerk…

244
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,500
Then we took part in Lee Man-ho's death.

245
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,586
And I took part in saving you.

246
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,801
<i>Ye-seul must be insane.</i>

247
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,636
<i>She sued me?</i>

248
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:31,930
I'll get you an attorney.

249
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,390
Just go get questioned.

250
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,350
I have a phobia against lawsuits!

251
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,312
Dad, you need to stop this.

252
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,064
It'll hurt you, too.

253
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:42,649
<i>Stopping the lawsuit</i>
<i>isn't the solution to this.</i>

254
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:46,361
I have a plan in my mind. Okay?

255
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,079
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

256
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,627
Hey, get started on your task.

257
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:06,965
<i>I found this photo while looking</i>
<i>for the reason of the disclosure.</i>

258
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:13,097
<i>It's Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,</i>
<i>the prosecutor's acquaintance,</i>

259
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,599
<i>and Cho Tae-yeong,</i>
<i>the CEO of TOYGOODTOY's competitor,</i>

260
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,976
<i>who's also Assemblyman Ko's</i>
<i>head supporter.</i>

261
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,896
If Seo Gi-yeol's son brings up my name
into this matter…

262
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:22,564
Will you sue him?

263
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:25,067
I can only stop the reporters for a while.

264
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:28,403
We should do that
to make people stop assuming, so…

265
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,155
You want to say it's not true?

266
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,411
That's what they're after.

267
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:39,957
They want to investigate
and see if this is true or false.

268
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,962
They're law students.

269
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:48,048
And Yang Jong-hoon is behind them,
waiting for a chance to get me.

270
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:52,761
Then are you going to do that again?

271
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:58,684
I should use that method.

272
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,687
What? What do you mean?

273
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,233
Our policy changed to differentiate
the credit line level for law students.

274
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,735
Our previous policy was established

275
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,947
back when over 80 percent of law students
passed the bar exam.

276
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,782
But at this point,

277
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,201
the percentage dropped
to 50 percent and less,

278
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:18,495
so many candidates
never make it in the law.

279
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,123
So the level depends on my grades?

280
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,208
Yes, that's the change in our policy.

281
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:27,462
If you have bad grades,
your credit line will be adjusted, too.

282
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,214
We need your report card.

283
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,216
How does this make any sense?

284
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,677
Why did the policy suddenly change?

285
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,224
What if I barely managed to pass the year?

286
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:43,645
Your current loan already exceeds
the credit limit of our changed policy,

287
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,189
so we can't give you any more loans.

288
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,319
<i>You must pay back the amount</i>
<i>exceeding the limit by next month.</i>

289
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,488
So loans are decided on grades, too?

290
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:58,994
HANJU BANK

291
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,499
ADJUSTMENTS FOR GPA 2.3 AND UNDER

292
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,085
Students who win an award
in the Justice Mock Trial Competition

293
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,212
are exempt?

294
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,258
Are you competing
in the Justice Mock Trial?

295
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:14,509
No.

296
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:16,803
-I'll do a civil case. Join me.
-No.

297
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:17,721
What?

298
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:22,643
Ji-ho, this says your dad took his life
after embezzling the company fund.

299
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:23,560
What is this?

300
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:28,649
There's a comment from this guy
who claimed to have been a manager…

301
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:32,569
No way. Did Sol serve time in juvie?

302
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:33,904
And for school violence?

303
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:36,114
Someone posted photos, too.

304
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:46,875
YANG WAS SOL'S PROSECUTOR
AND NOW TEACHES HER

305
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,669
KANG SOL GOT IN THANKS TO YANG?

306
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,758
I knew people would expose our info,

307
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,009
but now that they have,

308
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:57,844
I'm worried about the others.

309
00:16:57,928 --> 00:17:00,472
So you got in trouble without a plan?

310
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:03,058
We had to cause trouble to find a plan.

311
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,143
We won't sit around and get bullied.

312
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,023
What about the guest book from the funeral
Seo and Ko went to together?

313
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,901
If they didn't lose it…

314
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,111
She had three children.

315
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,489
I'm sure one of them
may tell us the truth.

316
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,911
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

317
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:27,165
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

318
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,713
Are you here to see me?

319
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:35,674
No, sir.

320
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,469
Come in for a moment.
I have to talk to you.

321
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,513
I won't go inside.

322
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,603
Your father could've been
the dean of this school.

323
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,274
You know that
he quit because of you, right?

324
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:55,152
Then you should lie low.

325
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:59,448
You shouldn't associate with troublemakers
who attack Assemblyman Ko

326
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:01,992
who works hard for our law school.

327
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,454
Think of your father and--

328
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:08,248
If you're concerned about me,
I'd like to turn it down.

329
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,214
That cheeky brat.

330
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,216
Professor.

331
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:20,510
Did you send for me?

332
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:28,769
Hey.

333
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,979
Have you seen Kang Sol B? My roomie.

334
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:41,323
Hey, you know,
if you win the Justice Mock Trial,

335
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:44,409
it'll help you become
a judicial researcher, right?

336
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,703
You saw the photo in the comments?

337
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,623
What? The photo? What photo?

338
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,089
HEY, SOL, DID YOU FORGET YOUR JUVIE DAYS?

339
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,257
Darn it.

340
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,427
<i>Take the photo down now</i>

341
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,846
<i>before I file a criminal charge</i>
<i>over portrait rights.</i>

342
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:09,768
What are you doing?

343
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,812
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY ME FOR THE DAMAGE

344
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,231
There are no clauses
in the Criminal Code for this.

345
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,734
You didn't know it's a civil case?

346
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:18,860
Of course I knew.

347
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,195
I got angry and confused.

348
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:22,489
Go with defamation
and make it a criminal case.

349
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:23,532
I can't. It's true.

350
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:27,661
I agree that we should abolish
defamation for stating facts.

351
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:30,872
The comment isn't the problem.

352
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,458
You didn't make it as the court's intern,

353
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,293
so you should win that competition.

354
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:38,839
Even for me,
it's tough to win an award there.

355
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:41,842
Then Joon-hwi, too. Two plus one.

356
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:44,594
I won't be a freeloader
or become a nuisance.

357
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,513
The three of us should compete.

358
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:50,183
I have a dire reason
to win an award in that competition.

359
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:53,437
If you want to win, it can't be you.

360
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,313
Maybe your twin sister.

361
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:01,319
I wasn't going to say this to you, but…

362
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:07,659
It's a matter of survival.

363
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:12,247
LAW OFFICER LOAN

364
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,207
ADJUSTMENTS FOR GPA 2.3 AND UNDER

365
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:16,501
Come on, say something.

366
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:20,172
Well, you should at least consider.

367
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,344
How much do you need?

368
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,267
If you need money, I'll lend you some.

369
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:37,522
Hey, we lived together for a while
as roommates.

370
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,274
How can you be so harsh?

371
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,067
She was shaken.

372
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,068
What?

373
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,912
GET OUT, IF YOU WON'T LEAVE, I WILL

374
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:53,246
CONSIDERING A CLASS ACTION

375
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,498
STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM

376
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,082
YOU'LL CRIPPLE YOUR NEXT BOYFRIEND

377
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,918
SO WHEN? GET OUT!

378
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,238
I apologize for having caused trouble.

379
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,157
I will…

380
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,411
move out of the dorm.

381
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,541
And I also apologize
for damaging the reputation…

382
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,212
of my fellow female students.

383
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:45,799
But please remember this.

384
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,427
As a woman,

385
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,264
I was tormented by his violence.

386
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:58,311
I was scared of his threats
and conciliation,

387
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:01,982
but as a law student,

388
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,736
although it wasn't enough,
I did the best I could to stay honorable.

389
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:13,201
And thanks to all of you
who study the law with me here,

390
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:16,162
I was able to return.

391
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,467
How superficial.

392
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:36,975
Hey.

393
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:42,981
Superficial?

394
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,067
You of all people can't say that.

395
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:46,985
What?

396
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:50,447
You got the court internship
Sol B couldn't and saw her trial.

397
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,573
So what if I saw it?

398
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:54,492
If you did, you couldn't say
it was superficial as a woman.

399
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,369
No, you should not.

400
00:22:57,495 --> 00:23:00,623
It was finalized after the first trial.
Haven't you read it?

401
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,917
What do you mean? I read everything--

402
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,753
Don't even try to lie to me.

403
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:06,713
You should give it a read.

404
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:09,632
If you think she's superficial
after you read that,

405
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:11,718
you're the one who should move out.

406
00:23:14,137 --> 00:23:15,555
Whatever, ex-convict.

407
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:19,100
Right, that?

408
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,186
Isn't that amazing?

409
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,772
A juvenile delinquent
becomes a student at Hankuk Law.

410
00:23:23,855 --> 00:23:25,607
Doesn't that seem amazing?

411
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,069
She overcame her dark history

412
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:31,029
and became an officer in law.

413
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:33,823
People love these stories, no?

414
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:34,741
What is it?

415
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:38,370
She says she'll make it big in law
because she's an ex-convict.

416
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:39,704
My gosh.

417
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:42,540
If you interned at the court,

418
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:43,458
you should know

419
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:47,045
getting sent to a juvenile hall
isn't a part of criminal punishment.

420
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:49,214
It doesn't leave a record,

421
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:52,759
so if you call her an ex-convict,
shouldn't you be ashamed as a law student?

422
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:02,811
LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY, LECTURE ROOM

423
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:08,441
SELECT

424
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,362
If you told them off for me,

425
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:13,905
does it mean you'll compete?

426
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:17,450
If you need money--

427
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:19,577
I don't want money to come between us.

428
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,788
What I need isn't your money

429
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,582
but your generous heart to help me.

430
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,210
Be honest.

431
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:29,754
You are thinking about it, right?

432
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:30,880
Get away from me.

433
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:34,384
I wasn't going to be this patronizing,

434
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:37,429
but I let people think
I was Prof. Kang's daughter

435
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,973
to help you get less stressed out.

436
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:42,434
Did I ever rub that in your face

437
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:44,686
despite all the misunderstanding
and hatred?

438
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,857
How's the trial going?

439
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:51,651
It's all right.

440
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:55,822
I'm doing it without an attorney.

441
00:24:57,615 --> 00:24:58,700
Then it'll get rough.

442
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:02,912
Not as rough as the time
I got questioned by you.

443
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,334
And I deserve it anyway.

444
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:12,547
Anyway,

445
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:15,758
the comments on that video
are really malicious.

446
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:17,010
Is everyone okay?

447
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,346
How would they be okay?

448
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:22,682
It's just that they can hold out.

449
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:28,688
Seung-jae, I have a favor to ask.

450
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:30,356
Isn't that why you came?

451
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,152
Everything but hacking.

452
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:38,323
I looked into the students

453
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:40,241
from your med school…

454
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,206
What? The president?

455
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:48,666
Do you know how agitated the president is

456
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:52,086
because of that malicious video
on Assemblyman Ko?

457
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:56,257
Well, it's not that I wanted to upload it.

458
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,800
If you get on his bad side,

459
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,428
your life at school will be hard.

460
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:05,016
And I'll be teaching practical classes
on the prosecution next year.

461
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:09,562
You know that you need good grades
on that subject to be a prosecutor, right?

462
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:11,397
Of course I do.

463
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,441
What can I do?

464
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:17,779
Yes, president.

465
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,534
Yes, I understand.

466
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:23,910
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

467
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:26,329
Professor, what should I do?

468
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,458
Drop that video
before the president asks to see you,

469
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,961
and upload a public apology
to Assemblyman Ko…

470
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:35,630
An apology video?

471
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:01,030
Embezzlement?

472
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,449
They're killing my dad twice.

473
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,997
My dad wouldn't embezzle money--

474
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,999
You're right. He wouldn't.

475
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:13,459
The prosecution found nothing
on his embezzlement

476
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:15,378
when they investigated his suicide.

477
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,672
So defamation of the deceased--

478
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:18,798
Let's wait and see.

479
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,925
It can't be just an individual.

480
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,719
He wanted to wait and see.

481
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,929
Prof. Yang looked into this?

482
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:27,265
Let's see.

483
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:29,934
Is your back okay
after you got stabbed by him?

484
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:33,646
No.

485
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,234
But I don't think he betrayed me.

486
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:41,946
Jin Hyeong-u leaked it out,
but Ko Hyeong-su instigated it.

487
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,033
In the end,
my target is the same as Prof. Yang.

488
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:49,537
And it's true that Ko is playing around
with Article 126.

489
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:52,415
But I'll fight to the end.

490
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,043
I believe it's constitutional.

491
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:58,922
Jin Hyeong-u should've turned him down.

492
00:27:59,005 --> 00:27:59,881
If he had,

493
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:02,175
my dad wouldn't have become a victim.

494
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:07,305
I'll make sure
I win and make Jin Hyeong-u pay.

495
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:09,766
I'm on your side.

496
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:13,770
Okay. Let's fight to the end
and win this case.

497
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,609
We couldn't show our mock court properly

498
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:21,694
after a man died in there,

499
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:23,196
so I was disheartened.

500
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:25,657
But Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su said

501
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,535
he'll do his best to hold
the Justice Mock Trial Competition here.

502
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:32,830
Did you call me out here

503
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:36,125
just to share that with me?

504
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,169
How can they slander a man like him

505
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,922
who always does his best
to help out his alma mater?

506
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:44,092
The students who were in that video
damaged our school's reputation--

507
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:46,135
You shouldn't punish them rashly.

508
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:55,770
You put me out of office
for damaging our school's reputation,

509
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:58,648
but you did it for nothing, correct?

510
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:00,441
It was a shameful moment

511
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:03,069
for a school that teaches the law.

512
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:06,531
That's because the police didn't conduct
a proper initial investigation--

513
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,783
Did you listen to what they said
on the video?

514
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,411
-If it's true--
-It's not true!

515
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:13,246
They're slandering him!

516
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:15,415
It's true. Everything is factual.

517
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:19,711
You should cut Ko Hyeong-su off
while you have a chance, President Lee.

518
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:24,215
And you're the one who should be
doing his best for the school.

519
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:27,510
DATE AND TIME

520
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:28,553
QUALIFICATIONS

521
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,021
You are interested.

522
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:44,318
You want to,
but not after your mom's suggestion?

523
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,739
It seems like you want to do it.

524
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:50,783
Let's do it together then.

525
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:55,079
Why do you try so hard to persuade me?

526
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,374
Why do you care so much about my roomie?

527
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:01,961
I'm grateful for her.

528
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:05,339
Are you sure it'll be okay

529
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:07,508
for you to record a video?

530
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,011
I won't be okay.

531
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,430
I'll be shattered into pieces.

532
00:30:18,728 --> 00:30:20,146
If it hadn't been for Ko Hyeong-su,

533
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,106
your uncle may not have been involved

534
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,150
in that hit-and-run incident.

535
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:28,237
And if so, he probably wouldn't have taken
the free land.

536
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:31,949
Then your uncle wouldn't have been killed,

537
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:36,204
and you wouldn't have been framed
for killing your uncle whom you adored.

538
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,373
If it hadn't been for Ko,

539
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:41,250
Dan…

540
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:44,378
wouldn't have left in such a hurry.

541
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:48,049
Ji-ho's dad
also wouldn't have passed away,

542
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:49,050
and Ye-seul…

543
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:55,348
I feel like I owe her,

544
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,518
and I hate owing people.

545
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:06,692
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL
COMPETITION APPLICATION

546
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:15,034
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

547
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,956
Hello?

548
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:22,917
Right now?

549
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,128
Yes, sir.

550
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:35,471
What--

551
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:37,014
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL

552
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:38,808
NAME: HAN JOON-HWI, KANG SOL

553
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,980
KANG SOL A

554
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:45,815
Hello?

555
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:48,234
Hey, our professor wants us
at the hideout.

556
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:49,819
Prof. Yang?

557
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,947
Prof. Yang asked us to come.

558
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:54,824
Right now?

559
00:31:56,117 --> 00:31:58,035
What time does he think it is now?

560
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:12,175
<i>I lost my world since I lost you.</i>

561
00:32:12,842 --> 00:32:14,302
<i>I have no reason to live.</i>

562
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:18,264
<i>I feel like my entire body is paralyzed,</i>
<i>not just the lower half.</i>

563
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:24,979
<i>I'd like to take this chance</i>
<i>to share my sincere apology to her.</i>

564
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:29,400
<i>I loved her so much</i>
<i>that I dreamed of marrying her.</i>

565
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:31,694
<i>When she got into law school,</i>

566
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:33,988
<i>I felt belittled</i>
<i>as we had prepared together.</i>

567
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:36,949
<i>I deeply regret and want to apologize</i>

568
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,410
<i>for causing an irrevocable wound</i>
<i>in her heart.</i>

569
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,622
<i>Now that I am crippled,</i>

570
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:46,125
<i>I finally realized what I have done.</i>

571
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:54,383
<i>I sincerely apologize</i>

572
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:57,553
<i>to Ms. Jeon and our people</i>

573
00:32:58,429 --> 00:32:59,680
<i>whom my foolish son</i>

574
00:33:00,556 --> 00:33:02,308
<i>have hurt deeply.</i>

575
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:04,685
<i>Please put the blame</i>

576
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:09,398
<i>on this father</i>
<i>who didn't bring him up properly.</i>

577
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,443
<i>And law students of Hankuk University,</i>

578
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,487
<i>please do not get abused</i>

579
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:17,907
<i>as a vessel in political slandering</i>
<i>against me.</i>

580
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,450
Political slandering?

581
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:21,202
It's like him.

582
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:23,496
I can't watch him. Makes me feel sick.

583
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:25,498
<i>As a politician,</i>

584
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:28,376
<i>I will pay the price…</i>

585
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,543
FREE LAND

586
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:32,546
…<i>for not bringing up my son properly</i>
<i>through legislations,</i>

587
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:36,717
<i>starting with reinforcing punishment</i>
<i>for dating abuse cases.</i>

588
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:40,179
<i>I will repay you</i>
<i>by working as hard as I can.</i>

589
00:33:40,263 --> 00:33:41,973
Where was this uploaded?

590
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:44,475
KO HYEONG-SU'S APOLOGY

591
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,185
What?

592
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:47,228
Wait, hey.

593
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:48,729
Why is this<i>…</i>

594
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:50,856
<i>I received support and help</i>
<i>for all the laws</i>

595
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,316
-Well, I…
<i>-I put into motion</i>

596
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,484
-Wait.
<i>-from a professor</i>

597
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:57,029
<i>of Hankuk Law School, Prof. Kim Eun-suk.</i>

598
00:33:58,155 --> 00:33:59,991
<i>-Together, we will do our best</i>
-What?

599
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:03,244
<i>to amend the laws regarding dating abuse.</i>

600
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:07,331
Why is Prof. Kim with that man?

601
00:34:07,415 --> 00:34:08,541
To make a law, he said.

602
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:14,505
<i>Also, I'd like to use this chance</i>
<i>to suggest Ms. Jeon, who is also a student</i>

603
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:17,842
<i>of Prof. Kim Eun-suk,</i>

604
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:21,220
<i>-to join us in this process.</i>
-Crazy…

605
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:23,556
What's he asking her to do with him?

606
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:26,058
My gosh. Why are we watching this?

607
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,644
Why don't you accept it?

608
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:32,231
Assemblyman Ko's offer.

609
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:33,399
-Prof. Kim!
-Prof. Kim!

610
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:35,943
You'll be doing it with me,
so give it a thought.

611
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:40,489
Goodness, why does my face look so big?

612
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:43,159
How did you film this video?

613
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,869
I have a bigger face than him?

614
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:45,953
You do.

615
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:48,456
I need to talk to you.

616
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,626
Is my face really bigger than his?

617
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,670
I must've been clenching my teeth.

618
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:02,428
Okay, fine.

619
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:05,056
I'll tell you. I'll talk.

620
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,099
President Lee told Prof. Jung

621
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:09,769
to make Ye-bum upload an apology video.

622
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:13,522
The great Yangcrates looks like
he has no idea what I'm up to.

623
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:14,648
I love it.

624
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:15,566
<i>It was Prof. Kim?</i>

625
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,861
I just did as she told me.

626
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:21,405
She's the mastermind behind this?

627
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:25,117
The press conference where he proposed
the abolishment of defamation by facts

628
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:27,078
was also her idea.

629
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:30,831
She did that to have an upper hand
for the trial of Bad FaMa.

630
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:32,583
But what's this one for?

631
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,878
How did Prof. Kim come up with an idea
to put on this show?

632
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,463
I'm so disappointed.

633
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:39,006
I didn't think of her like this.

634
00:35:39,924 --> 00:35:42,676
She even gave him a big hand
during Ko Hyeong-su's lecture.

635
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:45,096
Maybe she wants to go into politics.

636
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,222
I don't think so.

637
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:48,641
People love the Ko family's video,

638
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:51,060
but our video is covered
with malicious comments.

639
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:54,563
I'll say what they're doing is nothing
but a B-grade show.

640
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:57,108
I'm going to accept his offer.

641
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:07,618
Gosh, is someone talking behind my back?

642
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:12,832
What's this?

643
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,169
BILL TO PREVENT DATING ABUSE

644
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:18,629
When did you…

645
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,297
The Sunglasses is considering too.

646
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:24,760
Thank you, professor,
for becoming my special attorney.

647
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:27,054
I quit defending you
in the middle of the trial.

648
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:29,348
He didn't appeal, but be on guard.

649
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:33,102
If you're still thankful,
you can read it over.

650
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:34,979
BILL TO PREVENT DATING ABUSE

651
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,859
You already saw through my plan?

652
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:41,652
<i>A public apology?</i>

653
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:43,446
I can't believe I'm doing this

654
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,490
because of my foolish son.

655
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,285
I want to propose an act

656
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,248
which strengthens punishment
for dating abuse to atone for this.

657
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,585
Proposing laws won't get you exempt.

658
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:59,670
Exempt? No, it's to atone for what he did.

659
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:02,965
Only someone like me
could pass the laws I propose.

660
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:06,302
I'm a key presidential candidate
for a reason.

661
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:09,513
But I can't just press a button
to pop a legislation out.

662
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,933
And it'll get too old
if you hold another press conference.

663
00:37:13,684 --> 00:37:17,438
That's what concerns me.

664
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:19,982
You should counter them.

665
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,360
Instead of making him take it down,

666
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:27,281
you should have him upload your video too.

667
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,661
I can't have you see through me yet.

668
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:35,372
<i>I don't know the details,</i>

669
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:38,167
but I only did as Prof. Kim said.

670
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,127
She said

671
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:42,963
I wouldn't have to delete your video
or upload an apology.

672
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:45,508
I didn't want to be on Mr. Lee's bad side.

673
00:37:45,591 --> 00:37:48,052
What's wrong is that
he got us on his bad side.

674
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:51,722
When he finds out what he's like,
he'll regret it bitterly.

675
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:55,643
Yes, we should reveal his true nature.

676
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,852
I thought you were done defending me.

677
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:02,396
Hyeongseol is taking Lee's case.

678
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,856
Exactly.

679
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,151
If I did you good,
why didn't you continue to hire me?

680
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,236
If you gave me this,

681
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:12,031
I can bail you out on self-defense.

682
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,451
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u is a tough man.

683
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:19,330
But I, Park Geun-tae,
made him cancel the indictment.

684
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:23,000
On top of that, he was recently shot down
in a self-defense case,

685
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,502
so he's completely pissed,
it won't be easy.

686
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,891
<i>Prosecutor Jin has his eyes</i>
<i>on these two photos.</i>

687
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:45,189
If the way Lee Man-ho was stabbed
looks similar to this one,

688
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:47,816
could your case really be ruled
as self-defense?

689
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:53,906
I defended Lee Man-ho up until his death,
so I'll appear as a testifier too.

690
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:57,368
I plan on making a strong case
that it wasn't self-defense.

691
00:38:57,951 --> 00:38:58,827
My case

692
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,997
will be ruled self-defense for sure.

693
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:05,542
Gosh, you seem amazingly confident.

694
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:07,294
Who's your connection?

695
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,798
Someone who can consider
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u as his minion?

696
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,050
If that's the case, then I'll get lost.

697
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:16,053
Get lost, then.

698
00:39:18,347 --> 00:39:19,264
Okay.

699
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,266
HAPPY CORRECTION, HAPPY PEOPLE

700
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,309
It's me.

701
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,729
Ki Du-seong is 100 percent sure
it'll be ruled as self-defense.

702
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:28,649
<i>His connection thinks of Prosecutor Jin</i>

703
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:31,193

704
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:33,320
<i>It looks like Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su</i>
<i>got him</i>

705
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,280
<i>Attorney Song Ki-joon of Hyeongseol.</i>

706
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:37,449
<i>Anyway, I'll share the details in person.</i>

707
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,873
I'm sure Ko Hyeong-su made you rule
Ki Du-seong's case as self-defense.

708
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:51,630
You're a prosecutor,
so you shouldn't be treated as his minion.

<i>where Ko and my uncle went.</i>

711
00:40:09,314 --> 00:40:12,151
They hadn't lost it.
It was with Mr. Shin Woo-seop's daughter.

712
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:15,487
His son-in-law went to med school
with Seung-jae.

713
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:20,242
It's the evidence that Seo and Ko
were at the funeral

714
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:21,493

It can't prove that.

720
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,646
But why did Ko Hyeong-su fool you
and said he went the day before?

721
00:40:57,112 --> 00:41:00,199

Gosh, you should've said so sooner.

00:41:59,258 --> 00:42:02,010
I don't usually do everything
as people say.

732
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:03,595
I mean, it's Assemblyman Ko.

733
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,639
It was Assemblyman Ko…

734
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:10,310

Nothing?

743
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:10,495
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

744
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:14,750
I'm sure you won't dare to interrogate me.

745
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,628
What more do I have to say between us?

746
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:20,088
We're in the same boat.

747
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:22,257
Just as you were in the same car with Seo

00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:24,509

No, of course, it isn't!

757
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:19,022
Hey, that Kang Dan
or Erica Shin or whatever.

758
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,149
-Did you find her number?
-Yes, sir.

759
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,444
This is her number.

00:44:37,582 --> 00:44:38,917

761
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:44,589
Please head that way.

00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:01,857

00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:06,695
CHARGED WITH DEFAMATION…

766
00:45:06,778 --> 00:45:08,280
All right! A defamation case.

767
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:09,990
It's the only thing I'm good at.

768
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,577
This is freaking hard.

769
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:16,872
That's why I wanted to go
with a criminal case.

770
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:19,833
I want to be a prosecutor.
Why did I take up a civil case?

771
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:22,502
If we went with the criminal case,
we'd be against Joon-hwi.

772
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,755
Hey, so, what if we're against him?

773
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:26,131
I can win without you.

774
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:28,091
-Is that all you can say?
-Yes, it is.

775
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,720
Well, I'm scared of speaking
into microphones.

776
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:35,182
Why can't the main competition
be on paper like the prelims?

777
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,268
How will you stand in court
when you become a lawyer?

778
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,270
Overcome it with this.

779
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:44,608
Can we really do this in a week?

780
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:47,194
More time doesn't necessarily mean
a better performance,

781
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,195
but we need an award.

782
00:45:48,737 --> 00:45:50,530
Then the president won't be as harsh.

783
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,657
You're right.
I put my faith in you, Ji-ho.

784
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:59,414
Anyway, why did Prof. Yang bring us here?
It's not a crime scene.

785
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:01,792
I have nothing else to say.

786
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,335
How were you bailed out?

787
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:07,923
The land value is high here,
so this café must have cost you a lot.

788
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:10,509
Something happened to a friend,

789
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,886
so he handed it over
at a very cheap price.

790
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:15,597
Was your friend a driver to Cho Tae-yeong?

791
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:19,351
Cho Tae-yeong,
the CEO of a toy company called I-bit.

792
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:24,397
I have to do something.

793
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,649
The day I came here…

794
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:36,326
you were at Lee Man-ho's place
with his anklet.

795
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:38,036
Where did Lee Man-ho go?

796
00:46:42,874 --> 00:46:44,876
I have no idea, okay?

797
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,963
How the heck would I know
where he went and what he did?

798
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:49,756
Then how did you end up

799
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,259
giving me all these?

800
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,303
He was doing all kinds
of suspicious and weird stuff, so…

801
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:00,267
I already told the police
and the prosecution.

802
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:02,018
I'm grateful.

803
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,313
I was cleared of my false charge
thanks to you.

804
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:07,899
Then you shouldn't be here
obstructing my duty--

805
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:08,817
Your duty?

806
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,907
Don't people usually say
it's obstruction of business at a café?

807
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:21,037
What exactly is this duty
that we took you away from?

808
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:23,582
One more question.

809
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,793
The day we failed to see Ki Du-seong.

810
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,837
I don't know who it is.

00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,043

are very friendly only for Ko and his son.

830
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:40,408
They must be his avid followers.

831
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:42,160
These politicians have fans.

832
00:48:42,243 --> 00:48:43,787
He could be the next president.

833
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,456
What if it's manipulated,
disguised as fans?

834
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:48,249
Organized fake comments?

835
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,711

00:49:13,108 --> 00:49:13,942
Get it in there.

844
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:16,194
Hey, put in some more.

845
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:17,904
-That's way too much.
-Some more.

846
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:20,407
I'll put this up.

847
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:23,451
You need to get here.

848
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:25,662
-Put it on the floor.
-Yes.

849
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,747
-What's with your handwriting?
-Stay still.

850
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:30,375

<i>When my client found out</i>

00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:46,182
Ko Hyeong-su and his son
have put on a huge act together.

00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:48,226
Look at these comments.

858
00:49:49,144 --> 00:49:52,731
<i>You're right. These do seem suspicious.</i>

859
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:55,150
Hey, look at the comments.

860
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:57,193
This one.

861
00:49:57,277 --> 00:49:59,821
Look at how these IDs swarm in
as if they'd been waiting.

862
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,281
It's suspicious.

863
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:02,365
BUT HE WORKED SO HARD

864
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,659
They all show support for Ko and his son

865
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:05,910
but are criticizing us.

866
00:50:05,994 --> 00:50:08,538
They're manipulating these comments.

867
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:11,082
Prof. Kim wanted to confirm this.

868
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,501
But this phenomenon
can't be used as direct evidence

869
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:15,670
to prove that Ko Hyeong-su is behind this.

870
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:18,256
And I think Prof. Yang came here
to find a lead.

871
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:19,257
Right here?

872
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,473
If you won't pick up, hang up.

00:52:16,749 --> 00:52:20,170
That café was built on the free land
my uncle got from Ko Hyeong-su.

906
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:23,256
He sold the land
to Cho Tae-yeong's driver,

907
00:52:23,882 --> 00:52:25,175
but Cho actually owns it.

908
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:28,219
Why didn't you stay in the police academy?

909
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:34,184
Hey, Attorney Park.

910
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,686

911
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:38,980

SEO GI-YEOL'S WIFE KILLED HIM

918
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:01,883
AND HE SAYS HE STUDIES LAW?

919
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:03,802
Damn it, these evil jerks!

920
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,054
How can they go on a witch hunt
for everyone?

921
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:07,430
This is an act of terrorism.

922
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:09,641
This is considered murder, not defamation.

923
00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:11,142
Stop reading those.

924
00:53:11,226 --> 00:53:12,185
Forget about it.

925
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:15,105
We have no time to lose our mind
over some malicious comments.

926
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:17,232
We might end up dead first
before catching Ko.

927
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:19,317
The public is against us.

928
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,820
This is how he has maintained his power.

929
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:24,114
And my dad was one of his victims.

930
00:53:24,197 --> 00:53:25,949
We must annihilate this manipulation.

931
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:27,242
Darn it!

932
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:29,828

She's Kang Sol A's twin sister.

937
00:53:42,257 --> 00:53:45,969
They look exactly alike,
but they're on two different levels.

938
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:48,054
A sexual scandal with Yangcrates?

939
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:49,973
I can't believe her.

940
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,563
Why would you come here?

941
00:53:56,646 --> 00:53:58,398
Your sister will only lose her spirit.

943
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:04,863

Everyone.

949
00:54:28,178 --> 00:54:29,012
Hello.

950
00:54:31,598 --> 00:54:33,016
Is Kang Sol here?

951
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:34,893
Are you Erica Shin?

952
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:38,521
Where's my sister?

953
00:54:40,398 --> 00:54:43,151
She went to the library
to find some materials.

954
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:45,737
JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL IN 5 DAYS!

955
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,654
I'm Han Joon-hwi.

956
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:57,248
Did you make the statement
on the constitutionality?

957
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:59,959
Yes, I did that.

958
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:02,295
I enjoyed it.

959
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,259
I enjoyed your take
on how it's unconstitutional.

960
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,304
So you're my sister's roommate.

961
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:13,765
I heard
you two are teammates for a mock trial.

962
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:17,685
Yes. Your sister wrote it. Take a look.

963
00:55:32,951 --> 00:55:35,537
I'm Prof. Kim's attorney, Park Geun-tae.

964
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,835
You filed a suit against my client,
Prof. Kim,

965
00:55:42,585 --> 00:55:46,005
for slandering you in court
during the Bad FaMa trial.

966
00:55:47,048 --> 00:55:49,676
Right, have you been paying
your child support?

967
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:55,014
Sorry. I just get very curious.

968
00:55:55,598 --> 00:55:56,850
Aren't you?

969
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:00,478
I'll let you sue me all you want.

970
00:56:00,562 --> 00:56:02,147
You wanted to tell me that?

971
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,523
No.

972
00:56:05,024 --> 00:56:07,277
I wanted to tell you
not to drop your suit.

973
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:17,287
Write a note that you won't drop it,
then we'll have it notarized.

974
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,252
You seem a bit worn out.

975
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:28,339
That figures.

976
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:29,841
You were framed for murder,

977
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:33,928
then you got involved
in a sex scandal with a student.

978
00:56:34,637 --> 00:56:36,723
My gosh, Professor Yang.

979
00:56:38,892 --> 00:56:44,355
I mean, I've gotten used to dealing
with absurd rumors like that.

980
00:56:44,439 --> 00:56:45,857
Why did you want to see me?

981
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,984
It's not that I wanted to see you.

982
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:29,150
POWER OFF

983
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:33,029
POWER OFF

984
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:48,837
It has been so long.

985
00:57:49,963 --> 00:57:51,589
I wondered why you're Erica Shin

986
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:54,175
then found out you went to the U.S.,
to your birth father.

987
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:56,094
He's barely a father.

988
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:58,263
That married man had an affair with my mom

989
00:57:58,346 --> 00:58:01,224
then emigrated before he found out
he got her pregnant.

990
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:03,518
But he still gave you a different life.

991
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,437
He's better than that scumbag stepdad.

992
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:09,524
Just cut to the chase
and tell me why the three of us are here.

993
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:10,650
Let me tell you that.

994
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:12,819
I asked for you, prosecutor…

995
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:16,239
I mean, professor,
I asked him to have you here.

996
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:24,873
You must have another phone.

997
00:58:24,956 --> 00:58:26,416
I think someone's calling you.

998
00:58:30,169 --> 00:58:31,170
Darn it.

999
00:58:33,464 --> 00:58:35,758
I just need to check the CCTV.
Why can't I see it?

1000
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:38,469
Well.

1001
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:40,346
Hey, well.

1002
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:43,308
If you won't let me see it,
I'll have to call the police.

1003
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:45,101
It's a really important flash drive.

1004
00:58:45,184 --> 00:58:46,561
It's not that I don't want to.

1005
00:58:46,644 --> 00:58:49,188
It'll get more hectic with the police,
so just show us!

1006
00:58:50,189 --> 00:58:51,190
Gosh.

FOR LEASE

1017
01:00:02,804 --> 01:00:04,430
Stop shaking my sister around.

1018
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:08,351
Let her focus on her studies
and graduate law school.

1019
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:10,353
I don't want her to be involved with you

1020
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:13,272
only to become a nuisance
for Assemblyman Ko.

1021
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,532
Please ask Sol
to delete the video yourself.

1022
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:24,867
What if I say no?

1023
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:27,036
Then I'll upload a video myself

1024
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,581
that my accusation of Mr. Ko
was a misunderstanding and a mistake,

1025
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:32,875
that the letter was all fake.

1026
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,590
Now that she lives in a bigger world,

1027
01:00:40,174 --> 01:00:43,011
she finally got a grasp
on how the world works.

1028
01:00:44,804 --> 01:00:47,265
There was no violation
of the Election Act.

1029
01:00:49,892 --> 01:00:51,352
Why are you taking it this far?

1030
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:55,356
She went to a juvenile hall because of me.

1031
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:59,777
And that led to her involvement
in a scandal with you.

1032
01:00:59,861 --> 01:01:01,988
I can't let her get hurt because of me.

1033
01:01:03,906 --> 01:01:05,658
There's no reason for me to stay here.

1034
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,961
Delete her photos from the juvenile hall.

1035
01:01:19,297 --> 01:01:22,967
Delete all malicious comments
on my sister as you promised.

1036
01:01:23,051 --> 01:01:24,052
And the sex scandal.

1037
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:28,598
Bring everything back to its place.

1038
01:01:31,976 --> 01:01:35,897
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

1039
01:01:36,564 --> 01:01:37,648
Do it.

1040
01:01:37,732 --> 01:01:39,525
No way. We can't do that.

1041
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:41,861
If we only delete her comments,
it'll be obvious.

1042
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:45,615
Hey, do as you're told.

1043
01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:47,450
Do you want to end up like Lee?

1044
01:01:49,994 --> 01:01:51,370
Fine, I'll do as I'm told.

1045
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:54,874
Okay, we've been told what to do.
So let's do it.

1046
01:01:54,957 --> 01:01:55,875
Okay.

EXPOSING ASSEMBLYMAN KO

1053
01:02:10,598 --> 01:02:12,100
THERE'S EVIDENCE! IT GOT COVERED?

1054
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:25,571
How amazing.

1055
01:02:30,118 --> 01:02:31,327
What are you all doing?

1056
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:34,789
You're all under arrest
for manipulating online comments.

1057
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:36,332
-Cuff them.
-Yes, sir.

1058
01:02:36,415 --> 01:02:38,084
-Hey, don't move.
-Freeze.

1059
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,293
-Stop everything.
-Hands.

1060
01:02:39,377 --> 01:02:41,337
-Keep your hands there.
-What's going on?

1061
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,463
-Freeze.
-Okay.

1062
01:02:42,547 --> 01:02:43,965
-Be gentle.
-Don't make a move.

1063
01:02:44,048 --> 01:02:45,299
I'll walk myself. Let go.

1064
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:47,510
We should consider fake news

1065
01:02:48,136 --> 01:02:50,763
as a part of our free speech.

1066
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:53,891
Kang Dan,
you became a success as Erica Shin

1067
01:02:53,975 --> 01:02:56,686
all thanks to me, right?

1068
01:03:00,815 --> 01:03:02,817
I hope Yang Jong-hoon remembers that.

1069
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:06,070
I will remember that.

ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

1072
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:16,747
-We'll begin our search and seizure.
-What is this?

1073
01:03:23,212 --> 01:03:26,632
All right, now.
I'm Park Geun-tae, an attorney.

1074
01:03:26,716 --> 01:03:29,010
Give me a call if this seems unfair.

1075
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:31,220
Call me, okay? Goodness.

1076
01:03:31,304 --> 01:03:33,681
Here, take one.
You know me. I'm Park Geun-tae.

-Hello?
-Detective Jang?

1082
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:48,779
Kang Dan, you.

1083
01:03:48,863 --> 01:03:50,740
You'll have to pay for this!

1084
01:03:50,823 --> 01:03:51,991
Right.

1085
01:03:52,074 --> 01:03:55,328
Ms. Kang Dan's appendix burst,
so she never got on the plane.

1086
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:57,205
What?

<i>We're in the same boat, you know?</i>

01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:54,178
<i>Are you telling me to destroy evidence?</i>

1090
01:04:54,262 --> 01:04:56,931
Do you think I'll crumble down like this?

1091
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:58,015
What?

1092
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:00,351
These are all circumstantial evidence.

1093
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:01,978
<i>We need his confession.</i>

1094
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:03,104
There is a way.

1097

I'll represent you, as you wanted.

<i>It'll punish Ko Hyeong-su</i>
<i>for what he did, right?</i>
