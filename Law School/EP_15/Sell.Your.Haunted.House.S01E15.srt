1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,470
Ms. Choi.

2
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:09,509
(Episode 15)

3
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,059
Yes, she just went in.

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,299
She heard the recording file.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,829
And I told her everything.
Let's wait.

6
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,840
It will be hard
to make a decision right away.

7
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,470
Great work.

8
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,139
Should I get you some food
on my way back?

9
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:43,738
How about the macarons
I got you last time?

10
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:44,809
Forget it.

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,959
King-sized mandu.
Both meat and kimchi flavors.

12
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,540
You've reached Daebak Realty.
This is Hong Ji A.

13
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:18,340
Ms. Hong?

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,909
I'll testify.

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,689
But the secret ledger is somewhere else,
not here.

16
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:29,490
That ledger is the record
of all of Dohak's corruption.

17
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,430
That'll be...

18
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:35,659
more than enough evidence.

19
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:37,700
Ms. Choi.

20
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,930
Thank you for mustering up the courage.

21
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:55,749
He's that guy.

22
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,939
At 10:30 p.m. tonight, at Sky Building
in Haengun-dong, Seoul,

23
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,708
- Oh In Bum.
- A fire incident...

24
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,709
that is suspected to be
a gas explosion took place.

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,669
In Bum!

26
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:52,929
In Bum.

27
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,389
Mom!

28
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,180
What are you doing?

29
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,209
In Bum.

30
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,349
Are you okay?

31
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:55,990
What happened?

32
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,959
There was an explosion.

33
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,729
An explosion?

34
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:09,599
Scruffy.

35
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,399
He's one of Do Hak Sung's henchmen
who lied about wanting...

36
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,839
to sell the cold storage.

37
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,820
Right after Ms. Choi had entered
Sky Building,

38
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,180
I saw him leaving.

39
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:37,360
The police found this footage
of Sky Building before the explosion.

40
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,398
They're going to make a composite
based on the information we have...

41
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,870
and put out an APB by tonight.

42
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,940
Do Hak Sung is more terrifying
than ghosts.

43
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,279
How could he kill his secretary
of 20 years?

44
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,380
We must find him before the police do.

45
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,778
Last time, he headed toward
the intersection in Haengun-dong.

46
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,888
Okay. I'm sure we'll find a lead
once we look into the CCTV...

47
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,050
and his call records.

48
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,229
Give me a list of her real estate.

49
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,260
Include ones that are
under other people's names.

50
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,599
Why do you want to see that?

51
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,398
During my last call with her,

52
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,940
she agreed to testify
and mentioned a secret ledger.

53
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,170
But the secret ledger is somewhere else,
not here.

54
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,479
That ledger is the record
of all of Dohak's corruption.

55
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,180
That'll be...

56
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,550
more than enough evidence.

57
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,069
I'll look into it right away.

58
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,519
Will we be able to bring him down
with that secret ledger?

59
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,789
We must.

60
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,528
That scumbag is garbage.

61
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,299
How many innocent lives did he take...

62
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
just to murder Ms. Choi?

63
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,130
Didn't I tell you...

64
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,899
that you wouldn't be able
to catch me?

65
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,139
You just wait.

66
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,810
I'll make sure you get sacked
at all costs.

67
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,010
Go home safely, sir.

68
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,849
We'll meet again soon.

69
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,488
(Kind, Present, and Swift Police)

70
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,160
- Here he comes.
- Here he comes.

71
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,559
- Move aside.
- Is it true that you instigated...

72
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,998
the Yongnam Village fire
20 years ago?

73
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,628
Please tell us!

74
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,999
Please comment regarding
the death of your secretary!

75
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,170
- Please share a word or two!
- Is it true?

76
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,439
Please tell us your thoughts!

77
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,868
Please comment!

78
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,440
Do you admit to your offenses?

79
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,959
Sir, it's very difficult to reach you.

80
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,829
But then again,

81
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,300
I could still get out without your help.

82
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,400
Okay. Sure.

83
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,180
Have you reached Assemblyman Han?

84
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,478
Not yet, sir.

85
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,979
Those darn scumbags.

86
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,920
How dare they treat me
like a spent force?

87
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,649
What about the guy
who rigged Ms. Choi's house?

88
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,489
He'll be stowing away on a ship
early tomorrow morning.

89
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,089
I've located Scruffy.

90

(Daebak Realty)

91
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,608
He had turned on his phone
for a brief moment,

92
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,248
and it was around Haesung Port, Incheon.

93
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:19,020
(Daebak Realty)

94
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,190
I'll call the police for help.

95
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,619
Be careful, guys.

96
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,190
Even if we get him,

97
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,859
he won't tell us right away
that Do Hak Sung had ordered him.

98
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,329
When he had been detained last time,

99
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,329
he feigned ignorance
until he was let go.

100
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,900
This time, he'll spill.

101
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,140
Why are you so certain?

102
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,940
Because I won't hand him over
to the police.

103
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,640
Hello, sir.

104
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,400
Wait. Over there.

105
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,229
Scruffy was on that motorcycle.

106
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,170
So I heard you handled it nicely.

107
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,109
Well done.

108
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,108
You should leave Korea for a while.

109
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,410
Thank you.

110
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,290
No. This can't be.

111
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,059
A man is passed out here and bleeding.

112
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,860
Please hurry to the warehouse
at Haesung Port.

113
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,040
Stop it.

114
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,609
It's too late.

116

(Yoo Young Jae)

118
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,550
Now.

119
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,498
I'm inside.

120
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:58,969
She just left.
So she'll be there in ten minutes.

121
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,669
Take care of it.

122
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,739
Okay.

123
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,410
Ten minutes?

124
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
That will be more than enough time.

125
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,619
Let's see.

126
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,179
Oh, my.

127
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,950
You will burn anyway.
So why don't you come with me?

128
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,390
What's this?
Is that a key to a safe?

129
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,050
So I heard you handled it nicely.

130
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,379
Well done.

131
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,320
You should leave Korea for a while.

132
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,520

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,030
Thank you, sir!

134

Sir...

135
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,780
These days, people can get arrested
outside Korea.

136
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,910
- The key.
- What?

137
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,410
He left Secretary Choi's house
with a key.

138
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,959
Ms. Choi Sun Mi had a townhouse
under a borrowed name.

139
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,690
And there's a private safe
for the residents at the townhouse.

140
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,459
What's the name of the townhouse?

141
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,530
Happy Townhouse.

142
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,270
Okay. I got it.

143
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,890
Scruffy stole the key when he broke
into Secretary Choi's house.

144
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,930
You'll find a secret ledger there.

145
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,330
Did you find this out
from the spirit's memories again?

Yes, sir.

Push ahead with the safety test
of Sky Building.

If you don't get it going
and things go south,

152
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,799
it will be the end for all of us.

153
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,028
What if people move back into
the building and there's a problem?

154
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,200
There was a fire and an explosion
in the building.

155
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,269
Buildings won't collapse that easily.

156

Gosh. That chairman. I mean,

157
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,748
Do Hak Sung caused all of this mess.

158
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:37,449
Please take care of it.
I'll help you if you need anything.

159

How rude!

on suspicion of taking bribes.

- Let go of me!
- Let go!

00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,219
- Hey.
- Mr. Jung. Hey!

169
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,159
How could you do this to me?

170
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,860
- Let go.
- Hey! You're unbelievable!

171
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,989
Let go of me!

172
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,830
Okay. Thank you for your help.

173
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,015
With the evidence he got
from Secretary Choi's storage,

174
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,699
he will be able to prove
he's guilty of embezzlement,

175
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,440
professional negligence, bribery,
and instigation to murder.

176
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,309
Even Do Hak Sung won't
be able to get away with this.

177
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,450
So what? He already got away.

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,518
There's an APB on him,
and he's on the No-Fly List.

179

He'll be apprehended soon.

180
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,619
In the end, Secretary Choi died...

181
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,920
to get back at Do Hak Sung.

182
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,499
That scumbag ought to be crushed.

183
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,129
He took away so many lives.

184
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,169
Even at this moment,
more injured people...

185
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,900
are dying at the hospital.

186
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,169
Is that why?

187
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,110
A strange rumor is going around online.

188
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,080
A strange rumor?

189
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,509
A lot of people are saying
they saw a ghost at Sky Building.

190
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:18,120
But what's odd is that
the ghost is faceless.

191
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,190
And when they see the ghost,
they will end up dying.

192
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,590
What is it?

193
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,269
Did I say something wrong?

(Jinsung University Hospital)

195
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,350
It can't be, right?

196
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,529
The doctor said it was
something like mass hysteria.

197
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,330
He'll be fine
once he's stable and gets treated.

198
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,769
We're all going to die.

199
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,969
It's going to kill all of us.

200
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,739
You'll be okay, honey. Calm down.
Goodness.

201
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,549
Gosh, that sound...

202
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,649
That's the sound
of a faceless ghost coming.

203
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,950
Spare me.

204
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,288
- Spare me.
- Honey.

205
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,390
Spare me.

206
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,988
All right, calm down.

207
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:34,759
- Someone help us, please.
- We need someone here!

208
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,539
That's the second person.

209
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,610
He also died after he said
he saw a faceless ghost.

210
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,949
What if something bad happens to us?

211
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,318
Tell me about it.
What's going on here?

212
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,779
I'm too frightened to stay here.

213
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,219
The faceless ghost...

214
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,390
he told us about...

215
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,330
is the egg ghost, right?

216
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,299
The same one
that possessed me 20 years ago.

217
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,830
Yes.

218
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,568
Like that time,

219
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,769
people who died in the fire at once
became the egg ghost.

220
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,840
That means Do Hak Sung...

221
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,209
made the egg ghost again
just like that time.

222
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,229
That egg ghost appeared
at the hospital and killed people?

223
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,759
The egg ghost is
at Sky Building right now.

224
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,529
People who died in the hospital were...

225
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:51,269
probably bewitched by it
back at the Sky Building.

226
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,039
Egg ghost.

227
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,009
Is there no way of doing
an exorcism ritual on that one?

228
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,340
There's only one way.

229
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,308
By stabbing someone
who's possessed...

230
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:03,880
with a nameless needle
and killing it.

231
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,219
Someone who's possessed
by the egg ghost?

232
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,559
Like a psychic?

233
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,430
Are you saying In Bum has to die?

234
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,170
An egg ghost can possess
an exorcist's body as well.

235
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:30,110
Does this mean
either one of you has to die?

236
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,019
You're kidding, right?

237
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,989
Let's not do this exorcism ritual.

238
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:53,259
If we let it go on,

239
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,630
it'll continue to kill more people.

240
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,600
It doesn't go around
killing people forever.

241
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,538
It vanishes once it kills
enough people to vent its spite.

242
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,809
How many people must die
before it loses its spite?

243
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,850
One hundred? Two hundred?

244
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,110
What if it's 1,000 people?

245
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,880
Can we sacrifice one person...

246
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,120
to save 1,000 people?

247
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,940
If I don't perform the exorcism,

248
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,028
more people will die.

249
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,729
To stop that disaster,

250
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,028
we must sacrifice the boy.

251
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,769
What are you talking about?

252
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,529
I don't care about that disaster.

253
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,769
You cannot kill In Bum!

254
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,019
An egg ghost is...

255
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,950
an evil spirit
that cannot be controlled by humans.

256
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:50,160
It's like a natural disaster.

257
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:53,259
How is this a natural disaster?

258

People who died a wrongful death
because of Do Hak Sung...

259
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,558
became that egg ghost.

260
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,400
And that egg ghost is
about to kill more people.

261
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,568
How can we turn a blind eye to this?

262
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,900
What if we don't?
Do you have a plan?

263
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,239
What now?

264
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,568
Will you sacrifice yourself?

265
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:10,209
No, he can't do that!

266
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,579
I'm saying I'll find a way.

267
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,979
That's enough, all of you.

268
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:21,890

269
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,219
Do whatever you want.

270
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,660

or help those unfortunate people.

of revoking...

277

the building completion certificate
for Sky Building.

278
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:55,919
The permit
shouldn't have been granted...

279
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,759
due to faulty construction
to begin with.

280
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,089
Do Hak Sung lobbied some people...

281
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,090
and completed the building
out of the ordinary.

282
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,650
Once I have the certification revoked,

283
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,100
it'll only last for a while,

284
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,289

any huge disasters.

due to the cheap interior material,

Why did you go there?

360
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,120
I was just passing by.

361
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,418
You were just passing by,

362
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,589
but then you caused a scene
and damaged their property?

363
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,639
Had you gone there on purpose,
it would've been horrendous.

364
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,459
You couldn't help...

365
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,600
but feel concerned, could you?

366
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,269
I knew it.

367
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,068
The Ms. Hong I know...

368
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,939
acts coldly toward others
but is actually warmhearted.

369
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,350
Give me the paper
you've been jotting down on.

370
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,518
You knew?

371
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,439
How could I not
when we live under the same roof?

372
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,549
It's a list of individuals
from Sky Building who have died.

373
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,800
In order to perform an exorcism,
we need to identify the unrested spirit.

374
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,039
That's where I began.

375
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,239
We should identify the unrested spirits...

376
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,810
if we want to do anything.

377
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,919
I've visited the police, hospital,
fire station,

378
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,518
and the bereaved families.

379
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,518
If an egg ghost is created
by several unrested spirits...

380
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,519
who have died at the same time
in the same place,

381
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,220
then those eight individuals
are the names.

382
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,600
Since there are eight of them,

383
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,430
maybe you should stab me eight times.

384
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,499
Or...

385
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,870
stab me once with eight needles?

386
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,379
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you could die?

387
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:48,539
Right.

388
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:54,149
Hold on. You're a skillful exorcist,
and I'm a special psychic.

389
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,619
What's there to worry about?

390
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,990
All right. Let's think this through.

391
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,779
Have you gone crazy?
How dare you come here?

392
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,550
Please help me this once, sir.

393
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:32,019
I refuse to go down like this.

394
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,990
If you help me,

395
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,990
I will get back on my feet.

396
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,588
Think about the hefty amount
of money I've given you!

397
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,229
You darn thug.

398
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,800
Are you threatening me?

399
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,740
Do you not get it?

400
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,539
You're done for.

401
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,850
You've ruined my appetite.

402
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,069
After leeching off of me,

403
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,140
how dare he call me a thug?

404
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,839
That darn scumbag.

405
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:47,129
How did it go?

406
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,600
The police have blocked
all your secret accounts.

407
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,039
Darn it.

408
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:01,939
How in the world did the police get...

409
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,379
the secret ledger Ms. Choi had?

410
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,919
Ms. Hong.

411
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,149
It was Ms. Hong from Daebak Realty.

412
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,060
And she was the last person
to speak with Ms. Choi.

413
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:17,229
What?

414
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,300
Hong Ji A, that wench.

415
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,229
Find out her whereabouts
and report back to me.

419
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,950
The ship will head for Vladivostok
tomorrow evening.

420

This is as far...

421

as I can help you, sir.

422
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,330
You scumbag.

423
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,499
Don't you know
how much I've paid you?

424
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,600
That's why...

425
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,729
I'm doing this much.

426
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,669
All right, then.

427
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,539
Goodbye.

428
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,350
Take this with you, you scumbag!

429
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:21,060

430

Hong Ji A...

431
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,800
They passed the safety inspection
of Sky Building?

432
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,128
What do you mean?

433
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,099
They were even debating whether
to cancel the construction or not,

434
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,439
so how did it pass?

435
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,910
It's not that easy to shut down
a construction.

436
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,108
Not only did Do Hak Sung bribe
his way into getting the approval,

437
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:46,309
but there's faulty construction too.
So why did it pass?

438
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,620
Did the higher-ups pressure you?

439
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:51,818
It's not like that.

440
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,289
Then what is it?

441
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,430
Sir.

442
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:59,829
We can't let people move
into that dangerous building.

443
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,599
The safety inspection was done
by a reliable company,

444
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,430
and no one's moving in just yet.

445
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:08,038
They will thoroughly reinforce
the construction...

446
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,510
before letting anyone move in,

447
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,010

by several unrested spirits...

in the same place,

Yes?

456
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,720
Why are you out here?

457
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:12,260
No.

458
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,200
So many people will die
once people start moving back in.

459
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,030
They won't move back
into the building right now.

460
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,470
It's only going to get delayed.

461
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:24,609
As long as the egg ghost is in there,

462
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,939
a disaster is bound to happen.

463
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,449
It hasn't happened yet.

464
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,180
But you know that it will.

465
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,780
What then?

466
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:38,749
Will you kill Oh In Bum?

- No one will die.

How?

470
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,268
To dissipate an evil spirit like
an egg ghost, someone must die.

471
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:56,669
What if I seal it instead of killing it?

472
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,209
What are you talking about?

473
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:00,839
Oh In Bum got a list of the victims
who died from the incident.

474
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,850
Sealing them might work.

475
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:08,280
It's only your speculation.

476
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:12,859
Don't worry.

477
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:16,559
I'm sealing the spirit, not killing it.

478
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,689
So no one will die.

479
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,470
And if anything goes wrong,

480
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,240

that I can't die...

before I send off my mother.

484
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,370
Seal it?

485
00:43:57,169 --> 00:44:00,100
It's a curse that looks up
a very strong evil spirit.

486
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,669
It's only temporary
since it's not an exorcism.

487
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:04,870
Let's think about...

488
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:06,910
the perfect solution with some time.

489
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,910
Then, no one has to sacrifice their lives.

490
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,649
The exorcist will experience
a side effect.

491
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,979
That's why we don't usually seal spirits.

492
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,450
A side effect?

493
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,160
Wouldn't that put you in danger?

494
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:25,660

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,899

538
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:37,240
(Jo Yong Jin, Hwang Ho Sun)

539
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,510
Get out, In Bum!

540
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:10,310
This is good. It's always good!

541
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,169
Your food is the best.

542
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:13,879
Just the food?

543
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:15,209
No.

544
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,050
Everything you do is perfect,
Ms. Hong Mi Jin.

545
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:23,620
Hey, Ji A.
Why are you standing there?

546
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:25,089
Come and eat breakfast.

547
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,499
Ji A, come and take a seat.

548
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,299
Come and sit already.

549
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Mom.

550
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:41,269
Nice, fried eggs.

551
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:45,109
Is it good?

552
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,689
Mom.

553
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,830
I had a dream.

554
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,200
What was it about?

555
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:14,939
I was an exorcist in the dream.

556
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,370
An exorcist? What is that?

557
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:24,580
Someone who lets unrested spirits
leave this world.

558
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:31,350
You were a psychic.

559
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,089
A psychic?

560
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:34,989
What's that?

561
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,330
No idea, but it sounds like
a perfect job for you.

562
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,629
What an interesting dream.

563
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,370
It was sad.

564
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,379
You were an unrested spirit
in my dream.

565
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,589
You're still a little girl, aren't you?

566
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,620
It was just a dream.
Don't be sad. I'm right here.

567
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:13,229
I'm not sad anymore.

568
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,899
Hey, Ji A.

569
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,200
What's that necklace?

570
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:21,539
You're right.
I've never seen it before.

571
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:23,539
My necklace?

572
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,038
It'll get in your way as you eat.

573
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:29,209
You should take it off.

574
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:39,990
Take off your necklace.

575
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:45,459
- Yes, Ji A. Take it off.
- Yes.

576
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,100
Just take it off.

577
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:50,169
Take off that necklace.

578
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:04,649
I've been bewitched.

579
00:53:07,649 --> 00:53:08,680
What?

580
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:12,019
This isn't real.

581
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:37,209
You aren't my mom.

582
00:53:59,499 --> 00:54:00,499
In Bum.

583
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:56,089
You cannot leave this room.

584
00:54:57,229 --> 00:54:58,359
Never.

585
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,329
If I don't perform the exorcism,
more people will die.

586
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,069
To stop that disaster,

587
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,169
we must sacrifice the boy.

588
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,620
This was it.

589
00:55:30,189 --> 00:55:32,289
This was how she felt back then.

590
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,939
She couldn't let
this horrible disaster...

591
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,769
go out into the world.

592
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,280
Because she's an exorcist.

593
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,818
Stabbing a spirit...

594
00:55:57,819 --> 00:56:00,100
without writing down its name
could cause physical damage.

595
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,889
Stabbing a possessed psychic's heart...

596
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,229
is the only way to exorcize them.

597
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,229
Once the psychic dies,

598
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:08,859
the egg ghost also vanishes.

599
00:57:03,689 --> 00:57:04,749
Ms. Hong.

600
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,999
No!

601
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,870
No.

602
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:01,609
We did it.

603
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,450
I'm glad.

604
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,399
Secretary Ju.

605
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,669
We're done with the exorcism.

606
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,669
We did it.

607
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,419
(Secretary Ju Hwa Jeong)

608
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,060
I told you to look forward...

609
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,470
to the kind of interesting things
that will happen...

610
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:54,530
once you turn me into your enemy.
