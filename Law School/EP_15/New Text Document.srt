00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:20,039
PUBLICATION OF SUSPECTED CRIME

2
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,708
MADE BY AUTHORITIES BEFORE…

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,085
FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW

4
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,588
"Once the media begins to report
on one's charges,

5
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:29,174
it will plant presupposition and bias
on the judges.

6
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,968
This damages
the defendant's right to a fair trial."

7
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:35,555
"The defendant may be innocent,
but the damage cannot be restored."

8
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,015
We should assert…

9
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,311
What's wrong? You don't like that?

10
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:42,645
APPLICANT: JIN HYEONG-U

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,565
Why? It's well-written.

12
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:48,151
This seems good enough
to be up against Prof. Kang Ju-man.

13
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,112
I get that you'd rather have
Prof. Yang write this,

14
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:52,989
but he said he can't do that.

15
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:55,325
So why can't he do it?

16
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:56,993
JIN HYEONG-U

17
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:59,203
APPLICANT'S TESTIFIER: YANG JONG-HOON

18
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,080
CONCERNED PARTY: KANG SOL

00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:02,415

20
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:08,213
TESTIFIER STATEMENT

21
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:20,558
How can you be Prosecutor Jin's testifier?

22
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:23,436
My opinion is that it's unconstitutional.

23
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,147
Then why were you so keen
on having Jin indicted?

24
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,899
I needed to get him in court.

25
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:29,817
You did what I couldn't do.

26
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:31,819
You weren't helping me.

27
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,905
You used me to get what you wanted.

28
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:34,906
"Used"?

29
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:38,201
You knew if Jin gets indicted,
he'd request a constitutional review,

30
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,244
and used me, right?

31
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:41,663
-If you shared your intention--
-My intention?

32
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:44,582
What's my intention?

33
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:49,671
My father passed away

34
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:53,258
due to his publication of my dad's
suspected crime, but you--

35
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,884
It's yours to prove on the trial.

36
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:57,220
It must be found constitutional
for the trial--

37
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:58,888
Then you shouldn't be here now.

38
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:03,101
Prosecutor Jin and I
won't be an easy fight.

39
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,902
THIS ARTICLE CONTRADICTS
THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY

40
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,779
AND MUST BE ABOLISHED

41
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,634
Is that enough to convince the judges?

42
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,639
If publication of suspected crime
is allowed,

43
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:44,100
they say it contradicts
the presumption of innocence.

44
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:46,686
It's not to break
the presumption of innocence.

45
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,939
The people commissioned us
as investigative authorities,

46
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,483
so it's only natural for us to disclose

47
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,402
the suspected crime
after an investigation.

48
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,445
Especially when…

49
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,948
a key presidential candidate
such as Ko Hyeong-su

50
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,241
or other high officials

51
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,577
are investigated
for crimes and corruption…

52
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,040
the people should absolutely have
the right to know.

53
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,127
Now that's a good argument.

54
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,594
Is this why you made me

55
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,179
the first prosecutor in Korea

56
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:24,640
to be indicted for violating
Article 126 of the Criminal Code?

57
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:28,019
A constitutional review
can be requested only with a trial.

58
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,730
How did you know
I'd request a constitutional review?

59
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:32,315
I would've done the same.

60
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,361
OFFICER CHO YE-BUM

61
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:42,408
OFFICER CHO YE-BUM

62
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,619
If you have questions, ask me.

63
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,371
His internship is over.

64
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:49,499
Don't contact my student in secret
and make him rat on them.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,001
POWER OFF

66
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:54,754
What was that? Did he hang up?

67
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:57,590
He needs to know that we know.

68
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:59,008
Squeak, squeak.

69
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,846
Not everyone can be a spy,

70
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,140
and you aren't cut out for that.

71
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:08,059
What do you mean?

72
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:09,936
I bet everyone thinks it's you.

73
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,979
You wrote Seung-jae's complaint, too.

74
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:14,107
It was a part of my internship.

75
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,441
I had to do as he asked.

76
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,610
I get that you want to be a prosecutor

77
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:19,904
and made a mistake
trying to be on his good side.

78
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,906
But still, Prosecutor Jin?

79
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:25,785
Sol.

80
00:04:26,953 --> 00:04:28,246
I don't know why I did that.

81
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,541
I'll take care of this, so--

82
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:33,084
You can leave the study group.

83
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,130
Then he'll have no reason to use you.

84
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,173
Joon-hwi.

85
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,509
How can you say that to me?

86
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:45,012
You of all people can't say that to me.

87
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:46,514
Why do you think I did that?

88
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,099
During the internship,

89
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:51,185
the guy who passed the second round
got all the attention.

90
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:54,105
I was practically invisible next to you.

91
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:58,401
I'm not the type who doesn't get noticed,

92
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,529
but next to you, I was just…

93
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,281
I get how you feel.

94
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:06,325
I've also suffered enough
with smarties at home and at school.

95
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,202
Only you get me.

96
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:10,454
Stop talking, and take care of this.

97
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,832
You said only I get you, right?

98
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:14,417
Then do me a favor.

99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,377
Okay, shoot away.

100
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,921
It's about that absurd vlog you film.

101
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,047
My vlog?

102
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:20,965
Yes.

103
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:24,927
What would've happened had the facts
about Lee Man-ho's sexual assault case

104
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:27,346
been published
through the proper channels?

105
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,183
He would not have been ruled
"feeble-minded" so easily,

106
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:34,270
and we could've prevented the verdict
which the public at large deemed unjust.

107
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,855
He oddly has a point.

108
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:39,692
Politicians who applaud publication
of allegations involving their opponents

109
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,569
and lash out when it happens to them

110
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:44,488
should no longer be allowed
to take advantage of the provision.

111
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:47,992
When did Ji-ho find out
Prof. Yang is his testifier?

112
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,785
He didn't say anything to us?

113
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:56,751
Article 126 of the Criminal Code
could not keep your father safe.

114
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,588
Who do you think benefits the most
from this law?

115
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:04,425
No other countries

116
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:09,180
have such a general and broad provision
against publication of suspected crime.

117
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:11,390
Regarding similar cases
in other countries,

118
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:15,311
Ms. Erica Shin, a lawyer
and comparative law expert at Harvard

119
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:18,481
who was also selected as a witness,
will virtually join us.

120
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:20,733
Are we ready for this video call?

121
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:24,570
He betrayed us to help Prosecutor Jin.
And what's all this fuss about?

122
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,739
They won't win anyway.

123
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,449
CONSTITUTION

124
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,709
Hello, I'm Erica Shin.

125
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:56,852
I'd like to thank Prof. Yang Jong-hoon
and the Constitutional Court

126
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:58,771
for this chance to share my opinion.

127
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:07,905
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

128
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,789
Look at the view count.

129
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,041
She totally made me do this.

130
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,252
Hey, doesn't this mean it's a huge hit?

131
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,796
I'm frightened.

132
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,549
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

133
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:31,012
Why didn't you tell me?

134
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:34,765
She asked me not to.

135
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,685
She said she'd call you in time
and asked me to stay quiet.

136
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:39,937
"In time"?

137
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,775
When is that time?

138
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,076
I believe it's now.

139
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:04,128
Hello?

140
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,838
It's me.

141
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:07,965
"It's me"?

142
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:09,592
Have you been well?

143
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:13,304
Have I been well?

144
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:14,889
How's Mom?

145
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:16,766
Is Byeol also--

146
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,232
Criminal Code Article 126
on publication of suspected crime

147
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,401
only exists in the Republic of Korea.

148
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:30,821
Before we take a look at other precedents
in other countries,

149
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:34,116
we must first consider
the biggest beneficiaries

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,327
of this clause in the law.

151
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:39,872
Erica Shin?

152
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:53,094
I was about to call you right now.

153
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,721
Do you have any money?

154
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:56,722
Money?

155
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,475
What makes you think I have any money?

156
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,727
I'm living off a line of credit.

157
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,480
Can you take out some cash
from that account then?

158
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:08,275
My landlord wants to raise the rent.
What can I do?

159
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,069
Otherwise, we'll have to move out.

160
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,617
Who knew Sol had a twin sister?

161
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,160
They look the same.

162
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:19,995
Hey.

163
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,875
They only look the same.

164
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,335
She went to Harvard Law.

165
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,504
She's not in her league with that career.

166
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:30,423
Anyway, why is she named Erica Shin?

167
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,299
Sol looked surprised, too.

168
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:33,634
Did you know?

169
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,970
Don't get curious. You'll get hurt.

170
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,346
Hold your horses.

171
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:40,766
I'm starting to get scared.

172
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,937
If you're that scared, take it down.

173
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,314
No, he's about to get the silver medal.

174
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,942
You're at 100,000 subscribers?

175
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,194
He had a good reason
when he uploaded that video

176
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:53,821
as if he was forced.

177
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:57,408
What I'm really curious about
is Ko's response.

178
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,412
The video blew up like this,
but why is he as quiet as a mouse?

179
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,206
He was in the media,
so he probably put an embargo on this.

180
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,417
And he won't take a legal measure.

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,004
He can't sue him for spreading falsehood,
but I thought he'd threaten him.

182
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,839
Did you see the bulletin?

183
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:16,886
Someone raised an issue
on how Yeong-chang came to the dorm.

184
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,766
What? No way.

185
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,727
They're saying we should kick her out
and have her punished.

186
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,686
They're furious.

187
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,979
Hey, don't look.

188
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:28,606
They want all of you,

189
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,901
from Ye-seul, who gave him a key,
to Sol and Joon-hwi, who let him go

190
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:32,902
although you knew.

191
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,655
But why did this suddenly resurface…

192
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,868
He wasn't staying quiet.

193
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,543
MOM

194
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:53,631
MOM

195
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:54,840
I sent you some tonic.

196
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:57,301
You'll compete
in the Justice Mock Trial, right?

197
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:02,056
This was delivered.

198
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,891
HERBAL TONIC

199
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:05,184
I'm throwing it out.

200
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,519
Why? It must be expensive.

201
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,270
You can have it then.

202
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,648
Again?

203
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:21,784
While you were busy
stabbing the kids in the back,

204
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,078
they also caused huge trouble.

205
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,538
Take a look.

206
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,999
RELAY VIDEO:
EXPOSING ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

207
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,335
If they want to make a case
against Ko Hyeong-su,

208
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:33,045
they should at least buckle up.

209
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,047
You can be their help,

210
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:38,509
just as you saved me
by making Ko abandon Lee Man-ho.

211
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,636
That happened by chance.

212
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,932
Assemblyman Ko was the one
who sent Lee's son to the U.S.

213
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,934
I gave him the Lee Man-ho Act

214
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,436
in exchange for the life of Lee's son
as James.

215
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,397
He's living a good life as James now.

216
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,901
If Ko Hyeong-su didn't ask James
to send them his recent photo…

217
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:57,069
Your photo?

218
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,947
Okay. Let me call you back.

219
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,492
I wouldn't have known that Lee Man-ho
had been in contact with Ko.

220
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:07,580
I had no idea why he broke his promise
to never talk about his son again

221
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,833
and wanted to make a deal
with a man like Lee Man-ho.

222
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,752
What if the world finds out

223
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:17,548
you made a deal with Lee Man-ho
after you enacted the Lee Man-ho Act?

224
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,759
You threatened him? That's unlike you.

225
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,512
To get Ko to abandon Lee Man-ho?

226
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,805
Threaten him?

227
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:27,224
I gave him a warning
disguised as a piece of advice.

228
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:35,691
So he got scared Lee Man-ho will talk
and took the bait.

229
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,945
How could he do anything like this
as a human?

230
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,322
-Darn it!
-I wish to have…

231
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,994
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,
you can't do this to me!

232
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:50,289
He was suffocated by him,
then the news was all over the media.

233
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,791
At that point,
it doesn't matter what Lee says.

234
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,337
Ko Hyeong-su can easily say
he's talking nonsense

235
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,796
due to his grudge against him.

236
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,466
And who would the people believe?

237
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,426
Lee Man-ho knew that.

238
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,012
That's why he kept quiet,
trying to make a deal with Ko.

239
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,599
But I pried for his connection
and tried to make a deal on his sentence.

240
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:11,268
So in the end,
Ko Hyeong-su got rid of him.

241
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:12,519
That jerk…

242
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:18,400
Then we took part in Lee Man-ho's death.

243
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,486
And I took part in saving you.

244
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,701
Ye-seul must be insane.

245
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,536
She sued me?

246
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,830
I'll get you an attorney.

247
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,290
Just go get questioned.

248
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,250
I have a phobia against lawsuits!

249
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:38,212
Dad, you need to stop this.

250
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,964
It'll hurt you, too.

251
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:42,549
Stopping the lawsuit
isn't the solution to this.

252
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:46,261
I have a plan in my mind. Okay?

253
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,979
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

254
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,527
Hey, get started on your task.

255
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:06,865
I found this photo while looking
for the reason of the disclosure.

256
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:12,997
It's Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,
the prosecutor's acquaintance,

257
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,499
and Cho Tae-yeong,
the CEO of TOYGOODTOY's competitor,

258
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:17,876
who's also Assemblyman Ko's
head supporter.

259
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,796
If Seo Gi-yeol's son brings up my name
into this matter…

260
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:22,464
Will you sue him?

261
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,967
I can only stop the reporters for a while.

262
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:28,303
We should do that
to make people stop assuming, so…

263
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,055
You want to say it's not true?

264
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,311
That's what they're after.

265
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:39,857
They want to investigate
and see if this is true or false.

266
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,862
They're law students.

267
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:47,948
And Yang Jong-hoon is behind them,
waiting for a chance to get me.

268
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,661
Then are you going to do that again?

269
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,584
I should use that method.

270
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,587
What? What do you mean?

271
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,133
Our policy changed to differentiate
the credit line level for law students.

272
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,635
Our previous policy was established

273
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,847
back when over 80 percent of law students
passed the bar exam.

274
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,682
But at this point,

275
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:16,101
the percentage dropped
to 50 percent and less,

276
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,395
so many candidates
never make it in the law.

277
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:21,023
So the level depends on my grades?

278
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:23,108
Yes, that's the change in our policy.

279
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:27,362
If you have bad grades,
your credit line will be adjusted, too.

280
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,114
We need your report card.

281
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,116
How does this make any sense?

282
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,577
Why did the policy suddenly change?

283
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,124
What if I barely managed to pass the year?

284
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,545
Your current loan already exceeds
the credit limit of our changed policy,

285
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:45,089
so we can't give you any more loans.

286
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:50,219
You must pay back the amount
exceeding the limit by next month.

287
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,388
So loans are decided on grades, too?

288
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:58,894
HANJU BANK

289
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,399
ADJUSTMENTS FOR GPA 2.3 AND UNDER

290
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,985
Students who win an award
in the Justice Mock Trial Competition

291
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,112
are exempt?

292
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:13,158
Are you competing
in the Justice Mock Trial?

293
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,409
No.

294
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,703
-I'll do a civil case. Join me.
-No.

295
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:17,621
What?

296
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:22,543
Ji-ho, this says your dad took his life
after embezzling the company fund.

297
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,460
What is this?

298
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:28,549
There's a comment from this guy
who claimed to have been a manager…

299
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:32,469
No way. Did Sol serve time in juvie?

300
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:33,804
And for school violence?

301
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,014
Someone posted photos, too.

302
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,775
YANG WAS SOL'S PROSECUTOR
AND NOW TEACHES HER

303
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,569
KANG SOL GOT IN THANKS TO YANG?

304
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,658
I knew people would expose our info,

305
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:55,909
but now that they have,

306
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:57,744
I'm worried about the others.

307
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,372
So you got in trouble without a plan?

308
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:02,958
We had to cause trouble to find a plan.

309
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,043
We won't sit around and get bullied.

310
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,923
What about the guest book from the funeral
Seo and Ko went to together?

311
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:12,801
If they didn't lose it…

312
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:14,011
She had three children.

313
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:17,389
I'm sure one of them
may tell us the truth.

314
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,811
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

315
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:27,065
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

316
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:32,613
Are you here to see me?

317
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:35,574
No, sir.

318
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,369
Come in for a moment.
I have to talk to you.

319
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:41,413
I won't go inside.

320
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:48,503
Your father could've been
the dean of this school.

321
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:52,174
You know that
he quit because of you, right?

322
00:17:53,091 --> 00:17:55,052
Then you should lie low.

323
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:59,348
You shouldn't associate with troublemakers
who attack Assemblyman Ko

324
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,892
who works hard for our law school.

325
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,354
Think of your father and--

326
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:08,148
If you're concerned about me,
I'd like to turn it down.

327
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:16,114
That cheeky brat.

328
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,116
Professor.

329
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:20,410
Did you send for me?

330
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,669
Hey.

331
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,879
Have you seen Kang Sol B? My roomie.

332
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:41,223
Hey, you know,
if you win the Justice Mock Trial,

333
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:44,309
it'll help you become
a judicial researcher, right?

334
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,603
You saw the photo in the comments?

335
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:49,523
What? The photo? What photo?

336
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,989
HEY, SOL, DID YOU FORGET YOUR JUVIE DAYS?

337
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,157
Darn it.

338
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,327
Take the photo down now

339
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,746
before I file a criminal charge
over portrait rights.

340
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:09,668
What are you doing?

341
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,712
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY ME FOR THE DAMAGE

342
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:14,131
There are no clauses
in the Criminal Code for this.

343
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,634
You didn't know it's a civil case?

344
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:18,760
Of course I knew.

345
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:20,095
I got angry and confused.

346
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:22,389
Go with defamation
and make it a criminal case.

347
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:23,432
I can't. It's true.

348
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:27,561
I agree that we should abolish
defamation for stating facts.

349
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:30,772
The comment isn't the problem.

350
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:33,358
You didn't make it as the court's intern,

351
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,193
so you should win that competition.

352
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:38,739
Even for me,
it's tough to win an award there.

353
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:41,742
Then Joon-hwi, too. Two plus one.

354
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:44,494
I won't be a freeloader
or become a nuisance.

355
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:46,413
The three of us should compete.

356
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:50,083
I have a dire reason
to win an award in that competition.

357
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,337
If you want to win, it can't be you.

358
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,213
Maybe your twin sister.

359
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,219
I wasn't going to say this to you, but…

360
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,559
It's a matter of survival.

361
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,147
LAW OFFICER LOAN

362
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,107
ADJUSTMENTS FOR GPA 2.3 AND UNDER

363
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:16,401
Come on, say something.

364
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:20,072
Well, you should at least consider.

365
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,244
How much do you need?

366
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:32,167
If you need money, I'll lend you some.

367
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:37,422
Hey, we lived together for a while
as roommates.

368
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,174
How can you be so harsh?

369
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:40,967
She was shaken.

370
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:41,968
What?

371
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,812
GET OUT, IF YOU WON'T LEAVE, I WILL

372
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,146
CONSIDERING A CLASS ACTION

373
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,398
STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM

374
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:55,982
YOU'LL CRIPPLE YOUR NEXT BOYFRIEND

375
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,818
SO WHEN? GET OUT!

376
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,138
I apologize for having caused trouble.

377
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,057
I will…

378
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,311
move out of the dorm.

379
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:37,441
And I also apologize
for damaging the reputation…

380
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,112
of my fellow female students.

381
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,699
But please remember this.

382
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:49,327
As a woman,

383
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,164
I was tormented by his violence.

384
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,211
I was scared of his threats
and conciliation,

385
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:01,882
but as a law student,

386
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:06,636
although it wasn't enough,
I did the best I could to stay honorable.

387
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:13,101
And thanks to all of you
who study the law with me here,

388
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:16,062
I was able to return.

389
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:29,367
How superficial.

390
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,875
Hey.

391
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:42,881
Superficial?

392
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,967
You of all people can't say that.

393
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:46,885
What?

394
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:50,347
You got the court internship
Sol B couldn't and saw her trial.

395
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,473
So what if I saw it?

396
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:54,392
If you did, you couldn't say
it was superficial as a woman.

397
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:56,269
No, you should not.

398
00:22:57,395 --> 00:23:00,523
It was finalized after the first trial.
Haven't you read it?

399
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,817
What do you mean? I read everything--

400
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,653
Don't even try to lie to me.

401
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,613
You should give it a read.

402
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:09,532
If you think she's superficial
after you read that,

403
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,618
you're the one who should move out.

404
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:15,455
Whatever, ex-convict.

405
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:19,000
Right, that?

406
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:21,086
Isn't that amazing?

407
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:23,672
A juvenile delinquent
becomes a student at Hankuk Law.

408
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,507
Doesn't that seem amazing?

409
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,969
She overcame her dark history

410
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:30,929
and became an officer in law.

411
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:33,723
People love these stories, no?

412
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:34,641
What is it?

413
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:38,270
She says she'll make it big in law
because she's an ex-convict.

414
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:39,604
My gosh.

415
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:42,440
If you interned at the court,

416
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:43,358
you should know

417
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:46,945
getting sent to a juvenile hall
isn't a part of criminal punishment.

418
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,114
It doesn't leave a record,

419
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:52,659
so if you call her an ex-convict,
shouldn't you be ashamed as a law student?

420
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,711
LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY, LECTURE ROOM

421
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:08,341
SELECT

422
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,262
If you told them off for me,

423
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:13,805
does it mean you'll compete?

424
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:17,350
If you need money--

425
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,477
I don't want money to come between us.

426
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,688
What I need isn't your money

427
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,482
but your generous heart to help me.

428
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,110
Be honest.

429
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,654
You are thinking about it, right?

430
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:30,780
Get away from me.

431
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:34,284
I wasn't going to be this patronizing,

432
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:37,329
but I let people think
I was Prof. Kang's daughter

433
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,873
to help you get less stressed out.

434
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,334
Did I ever rub that in your face

435
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,586
despite all the misunderstanding
and hatred?

436
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,757
How's the trial going?

437
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:51,551
It's all right.

438
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:55,722
I'm doing it without an attorney.

439
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:58,600
Then it'll get rough.

440
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:02,812
Not as rough as the time
I got questioned by you.

441
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,234
And I deserve it anyway.

442
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:12,447
Anyway,

443
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:15,658
the comments on that video
are really malicious.

444
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:16,910
Is everyone okay?

445
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,246
How would they be okay?

446
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:22,582
It's just that they can hold out.

447
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:28,588
Seung-jae, I have a favor to ask.

448
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,256
Isn't that why you came?

449
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:34,052
Everything but hacking.

450
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:38,223
I looked into the students

451
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:40,141
from your med school…

452
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,106
What? The president?

453
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,566
Do you know how agitated the president is

454
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,986
because of that malicious video
on Assemblyman Ko?

455
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,157
Well, it's not that I wanted to upload it.

456
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,700
If you get on his bad side,

457
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,328
your life at school will be hard.

458
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,916
And I'll be teaching practical classes
on the prosecution next year.

459
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:09,462
You know that you need good grades
on that subject to be a prosecutor, right?

460
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:11,297
Of course I do.

461
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:13,341
What can I do?

462
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:17,679
Yes, president.

463
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:22,434
Yes, I understand.

464
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:23,810
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

465
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:26,229
Professor, what should I do?

466
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:30,358
Drop that video
before the president asks to see you,

467
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:32,861
and upload a public apology
to Assemblyman Ko…

468
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:35,530
An apology video?

469
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:00,930
Embezzlement?

470
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:03,349
They're killing my dad twice.

471
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,897
My dad wouldn't embezzle money--

472
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,899
You're right. He wouldn't.

473
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:13,359
The prosecution found nothing
on his embezzlement

474
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:15,278
when they investigated his suicide.

475
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,572
So defamation of the deceased--

476
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:18,698
Let's wait and see.

477
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,825
It can't be just an individual.

478
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,619
He wanted to wait and see.

479
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:24,829
Prof. Yang looked into this?

480
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:27,165
Let's see.

481
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,834
Is your back okay
after you got stabbed by him?

482
00:27:32,504 --> 00:27:33,546
No.

483
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,134
But I don't think he betrayed me.

484
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:41,846
Jin Hyeong-u leaked it out,
but Ko Hyeong-su instigated it.

485
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,933
In the end,
my target is the same as Prof. Yang.

486
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:49,437
And it's true that Ko is playing around
with Article 126.

487
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:52,315
But I'll fight to the end.

488
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,943
I believe it's constitutional.

489
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:58,822
Jin Hyeong-u should've turned him down.

490
00:27:58,905 --> 00:27:59,781
If he had,

491
00:27:59,864 --> 00:28:02,075
my dad wouldn't have become a victim.

492
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:07,205
I'll make sure
I win and make Jin Hyeong-u pay.

493
00:28:08,748 --> 00:28:09,666
I'm on your side.

494
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:13,670
Okay. Let's fight to the end
and win this case.

495
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:19,509
We couldn't show our mock court properly

496
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,594
after a man died in there,

497
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:23,096
so I was disheartened.

498
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:25,557
But Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su said

499
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,435
he'll do his best to hold
the Justice Mock Trial Competition here.

500
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:32,730
Did you call me out here

501
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:36,025
just to share that with me?

502
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,069
How can they slander a man like him

503
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:40,822
who always does his best
to help out his alma mater?

504
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:43,992
The students who were in that video
damaged our school's reputation--

505
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:46,035
You shouldn't punish them rashly.

506
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,670
You put me out of office
for damaging our school's reputation,

507
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,548
but you did it for nothing, correct?

508
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,341
It was a shameful moment

509
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:02,969
for a school that teaches the law.

510
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:06,431
That's because the police didn't conduct
a proper initial investigation--

511
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,683
Did you listen to what they said
on the video?

512
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,311
-If it's true--
-It's not true!

513
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,146
They're slandering him!

514
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,315
It's true. Everything is factual.

515
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:19,611
You should cut Ko Hyeong-su off
while you have a chance, President Lee.

516
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:24,115
And you're the one who should be
doing his best for the school.

517
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:27,410
DATE AND TIME

518
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:28,453
QUALIFICATIONS

519
00:29:36,711 --> 00:29:37,921
You are interested.

520
00:29:41,424 --> 00:29:44,218
You want to,
but not after your mom's suggestion?

521
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:47,639
It seems like you want to do it.

522
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:50,683
Let's do it together then.

523
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,979
Why do you try so hard to persuade me?

524
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,274
Why do you care so much about my roomie?

525
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:01,861
I'm grateful for her.

526
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,239
Are you sure it'll be okay

527
00:30:06,032 --> 00:30:07,408
for you to record a video?

528
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:09,911
I won't be okay.

529
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:12,330
I'll be shattered into pieces.

530
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:20,046
If it hadn't been for Ko Hyeong-su,

531
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:22,006
your uncle may not have been involved

532
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,050
in that hit-and-run incident.

533
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:28,137
And if so, he probably wouldn't have taken
the free land.

534
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:31,849
Then your uncle wouldn't have been killed,

535
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:36,104
and you wouldn't have been framed
for killing your uncle whom you adored.

536
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,273
If it hadn't been for Ko,

537
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:41,150
Dan…

538
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,278
wouldn't have left in such a hurry.

539
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,949
Ji-ho's dad
also wouldn't have passed away,

540
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:48,950
and Ye-seul…

541
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,248
I feel like I owe her,

542
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:58,418
and I hate owing people.

543
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:06,592
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL
COMPETITION APPLICATION

544
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:14,934
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

545
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,856
Hello?

546
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:22,817
Right now?

547
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:25,028
Yes, sir.

548
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:35,371
What--

549
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:36,914
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL

550
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,708
NAME: HAN JOON-HWI, KANG SOL

551
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,880
KANG SOL A

552
00:31:44,547 --> 00:31:45,715
Hello?

553
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:48,134
Hey, our professor wants us
at the hideout.

554
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,719
Prof. Yang?

555
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,847
Prof. Yang asked us to come.

556
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:54,724
Right now?

557
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:57,935
What time does he think it is now?

558
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:12,075
I lost my world since I lost you.

559
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:14,202
I have no reason to live.

560
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:18,164
I feel like my entire body is paralyzed,
not just the lower half.

561
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:24,879
I'd like to take this chance
to share my sincere apology to her.

562
00:32:26,297 --> 00:32:29,300
I loved her so much
that I dreamed of marrying her.

563
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,594
When she got into law school,

564
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:33,888
I felt belittled
as we had prepared together.

565
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:36,849
I deeply regret and want to apologize

566
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:39,310
for causing an irrevocable wound
in her heart.

567
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,522
Now that I am crippled,

568
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:46,025
I finally realized what I have done.

569
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:54,283
I sincerely apologize

570
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:57,453
to Ms. Jeon and our people

571
00:32:58,329 --> 00:32:59,580
whom my foolish son

572
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,208
have hurt deeply.

573
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:04,585
Please put the blame

574
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:09,298
on this father
who didn't bring him up properly.

575
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:12,343
And law students of Hankuk University,

576
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,387
please do not get abused

577
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:17,807
as a vessel in political slandering
against me.

578
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,350
Political slandering?

579
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:21,102
It's like him.

580
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,396
I can't watch him. Makes me feel sick.

581
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,398
As a politician,

582
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:28,276
I will pay the price…

583
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,443
FREE LAND

584
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:32,446
…for not bringing up my son properly
through legislations,

585
00:33:33,156 --> 00:33:36,617
starting with reinforcing punishment
for dating abuse cases.

586
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:40,079
I will repay you
by working as hard as I can.

587
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:41,873
Where was this uploaded?

588
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,375
KO HYEONG-SU'S APOLOGY

589
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,085
What?

590
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,128
Wait, hey.

591
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:48,629
Why is this…

592
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:50,756
I received support and help
for all the laws

593
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,216
-Well, I…
-I put into motion

594
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,384
-Wait.
-from a professor

595
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:56,929
of Hankuk Law School, Prof. Kim Eun-suk.

596
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,891
-Together, we will do our best
-What?

597
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:03,144
to amend the laws regarding dating abuse.

598
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:07,231
Why is Prof. Kim with that man?

599
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:08,441
To make a law, he said.

600
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:14,405
Also, I'd like to use this chance
to suggest Ms. Jeon, who is also a student

601
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:17,742
of Prof. Kim Eun-suk,

602
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:21,120
-to join us in this process.
-Crazy…

603
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:23,456
What's he asking her to do with him?

604
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:25,958
My gosh. Why are we watching this?

605
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,544
Why don't you accept it?

606
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:32,131
Assemblyman Ko's offer.

607
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,299
-Prof. Kim!
-Prof. Kim!

608
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:35,843
You'll be doing it with me,
so give it a thought.

609
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:40,389
Goodness, why does my face look so big?

610
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:43,059
How did you film this video?

611
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:44,769
I have a bigger face than him?

612
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:45,853
You do.

613
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:48,356
I need to talk to you.

614
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,526
Is my face really bigger than his?

615
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,570
I must've been clenching my teeth.

616
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:02,328
Okay, fine.

617
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:04,956
I'll tell you. I'll talk.

618
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,999
President Lee told Prof. Jung

619
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,669
to make Ye-bum upload an apology video.

620
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:13,422
The great Yangcrates looks like
he has no idea what I'm up to.

621
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:14,548
I love it.

622
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:15,466
It was Prof. Kim?

623
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,761
I just did as she told me.

624
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,305
She's the mastermind behind this?

625
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:25,017
The press conference where he proposed
the abolishment of defamation by facts

626
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:26,978
was also her idea.

627
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:30,731
She did that to have an upper hand
for the trial of Bad FaMa.

628
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:32,483
But what's this one for?

629
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:35,778
How did Prof. Kim come up with an idea
to put on this show?

630
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:37,363
I'm so disappointed.

631
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:38,906
I didn't think of her like this.

632
00:35:39,824 --> 00:35:42,576
She even gave him a big hand
during Ko Hyeong-su's lecture.

633
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:44,996
Maybe she wants to go into politics.

634
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,122
I don't think so.

635
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,541
People love the Ko family's video,

636
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,960
but our video is covered
with malicious comments.

637
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:54,463
I'll say what they're doing is nothing
but a B-grade show.

638
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:57,008
I'm going to accept his offer.

639
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:07,518
Gosh, is someone talking behind my back?

640
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:12,732
What's this?

641
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:17,069
BILL TO PREVENT DATING ABUSE

642
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:18,529
When did you…

643
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:20,197
The Sunglasses is considering too.

644
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:24,660
Thank you, professor,
for becoming my special attorney.

645
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:26,954
I quit defending you
in the middle of the trial.

646
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:29,248
He didn't appeal, but be on guard.

647
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,002
If you're still thankful,
you can read it over.

648
00:36:33,085 --> 00:36:34,879
BILL TO PREVENT DATING ABUSE

649
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,759
You already saw through my plan?

650
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,552
A public apology?

651
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,346
I can't believe I'm doing this

652
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:46,390
because of my foolish son.

653
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:49,185
I want to propose an act

654
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:54,148
which strengthens punishment
for dating abuse to atone for this.

655
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,485
Proposing laws won't get you exempt.

656
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,570
Exempt? No, it's to atone for what he did.

657
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:02,865
Only someone like me
could pass the laws I propose.

658
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,202
I'm a key presidential candidate
for a reason.

659
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:09,413
But I can't just press a button
to pop a legislation out.

660
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:12,833
And it'll get too old
if you hold another press conference.

661
00:37:13,584 --> 00:37:17,338
That's what concerns me.

662
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,882
You should counter them.

663
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,260
Instead of making him take it down,

664
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:27,181
you should have him upload your video too.

665
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:32,561
I can't have you see through me yet.

666
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:35,272
I don't know the details,

667
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:38,067
but I only did as Prof. Kim said.

668
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,027
She said

669
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:42,863
I wouldn't have to delete your video
or upload an apology.

670
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,408
I didn't want to be on Mr. Lee's bad side.

671
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:47,952
What's wrong is that
he got us on his bad side.

672
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:51,622
When he finds out what he's like,
he'll regret it bitterly.

673
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:55,543
Yes, we should reveal his true nature.

674
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,672
I thought you were done defending me.

675
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:02,216
Hyeongseol is taking Lee's case.

676
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:03,676
Exactly.

677
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:06,971
If I did you good,
why didn't you continue to hire me?

678
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,056
If you gave me this,

679
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:11,851
I can bail you out on self-defense.

680
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:15,271
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u is a tough man.

681
00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:19,150
But I, Park Geun-tae,
made him cancel the indictment.

682
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:22,820
On top of that, he was recently shot down
in a self-defense case,

683
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:25,322
so he's completely pissed,
it won't be easy.

684
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,711
Prosecutor Jin has his eyes
on these two photos.

685
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:45,009
If the way Lee Man-ho was stabbed
looks similar to this one,

686
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,636
could your case really be ruled
as self-defense?

687
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:53,726
I defended Lee Man-ho up until his death,
so I'll appear as a testifier too.

688
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:57,188
I plan on making a strong case
that it wasn't self-defense.

689
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:58,647
My case

690
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:01,817
will be ruled self-defense for sure.

691
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:05,362
Gosh, you seem amazingly confident.

692
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:07,114
Who's your connection?

693
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:10,618
Someone who can consider
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u as his minion?

694
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:12,870
If that's the case, then I'll get lost.

695
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:15,873
Get lost, then.

696
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,084
Okay.

697
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,086
HAPPY CORRECTION, HAPPY PEOPLE

698
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,129
It's me.

699
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:25,549
Ki Du-seong is 100 percent sure
it'll be ruled as self-defense.

700
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,469
His connection thinks of Prosecutor Jin
as a minion,

701
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:31,013
so I think it's definitely
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

702
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:33,140
It looks like Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su
got him

703
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:35,100
Attorney Song Ki-joon of Hyeongseol.

704
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:37,269
Anyway, I'll share the details in person.

705
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,693
I'm sure Ko Hyeong-su made you rule
Ki Du-seong's case as self-defense.

706
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:51,450
You're a prosecutor,
so you shouldn't be treated as his minion.

707
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:07,299
The guest book from the funeral
on that day

708
00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:08,634
where Ko and my uncle went.

709
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:11,971
They hadn't lost it.
It was with Mr. Shin Woo-seop's daughter.

710
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:15,307
His son-in-law went to med school
with Seung-jae.

711
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,062
It's the evidence that Seo and Ko
were at the funeral

712
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:21,313
on the day of the hit-and-run.

716
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:44,503
But were they in the same car--

717
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:45,504
It can't prove that.

718
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,466
But why did Ko Hyeong-su fool you
and said he went the day before?

719
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,019
He may be your biggest connection
and the key presidential candidate.

If that's what Assemblyman Ko wants.

728
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:58,994
Gosh, you should've said so sooner.

729
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:01,830
I don't usually do everything
as people say.

730
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:03,415
I mean, it's Assemblyman Ko.

731
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:05,459
It was Assemblyman Ko…

732
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:10,130
so you did as he said?

Do you have anything to tell me?

739
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:05,978
What did you want to hear from me
to call me out this late?

740
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:08,313
Nothing?

741
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:10,315
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

742
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:14,570
I'm sure you won't dare to interrogate me.

743
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:17,448
What more do I have to say between us?

744
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:19,908
We're in the same boat.

745
00:43:19,992 --> 00:43:22,077
Just as you were in the same car with Seo

746
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:24,329
when he got drunk and hit someone and ran?

747
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:29,126
I don't know why you're doing this,

748
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:32,463
but you just have to trust me.

749
00:43:32,546 --> 00:43:35,632
The rope I'm holding on to
should not be a rotten one, you know.

750
00:43:41,597 --> 00:43:44,475
No, of course, it isn't!
What are you so worried about?

751
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:49,313
I have the law and the media
all in my hands.

752
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:06,121
Yang Jong-hoon, you lunatic.

753
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:10,125
How dare you shake Jin Hyeong-u

754
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:13,212
and get on my nerves?

755
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:18,842
Hey, that Kang Dan
or Erica Shin or whatever.

756
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,969
-Did you find her number?
-Yes, sir.

757
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,264
This is her number.

759
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:44,409
Please head that way.

00:45:00,509 --> 00:45:01,677
What's the prelim case?

762
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:03,637
FEBRUARY 2021

763
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:06,515
CHARGED WITH DEFAMATION…

764
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:08,100
All right! A defamation case.

765
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:09,810
It's the only thing I'm good at.

766
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,397
This is freaking hard.

767
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:16,692
That's why I wanted to go
with a criminal case.

768
00:45:16,775 --> 00:45:19,653
I want to be a prosecutor.
Why did I take up a civil case?

769
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:22,322
If we went with the criminal case,
we'd be against Joon-hwi.

770
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:24,575
Hey, so, what if we're against him?

771
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:25,951
I can win without you.

772
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:27,911
-Is that all you can say?
-Yes, it is.

773
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:31,540
Well, I'm scared of speaking
into microphones.

774
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:35,002
Why can't the main competition
be on paper like the prelims?

775
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:38,088
How will you stand in court
when you become a lawyer?

776
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,090
Overcome it with this.

777
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,428
Can we really do this in a week?

778
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:47,014
More time doesn't necessarily mean
a better performance,

779
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:48,015
but we need an award.

780
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:50,350
Then the president won't be as harsh.

781
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:52,477
You're right.
I put my faith in you, Ji-ho.

782
00:45:55,105 --> 00:45:59,234
Anyway, why did Prof. Yang bring us here?
It's not a crime scene.

783
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:01,612
I have nothing else to say.

784
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:03,155
How were you bailed out?

785
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:07,743
The land value is high here,
so this café must have cost you a lot.

786
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:10,329
Something happened to a friend,

787
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:12,706
so he handed it over
at a very cheap price.

788
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:15,417
Was your friend a driver to Cho Tae-yeong?

789
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:19,171
Cho Tae-yeong,
the CEO of a toy company called I-bit.

790
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:24,217
I have to do something.

791
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:25,469
The day I came here…

792
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:36,146
you were at Lee Man-ho's place
with his anklet.

793
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:37,856
Where did Lee Man-ho go?

794
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,696
I have no idea, okay?

795
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,783
How the heck would I know
where he went and what he did?

796
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,576
Then how did you end up

797
00:46:50,327 --> 00:46:52,079
giving me all these?

798
00:46:52,162 --> 00:46:55,123
He was doing all kinds
of suspicious and weird stuff, so…

799
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:00,087
I already told the police
and the prosecution.

800
00:47:01,004 --> 00:47:01,838
I'm grateful.

801
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:05,133
I was cleared of my false charge
thanks to you.

802
00:47:05,217 --> 00:47:07,719
Then you shouldn't be here
obstructing my duty--

803
00:47:07,803 --> 00:47:08,637
Your duty?

804
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:15,727
Don't people usually say
it's obstruction of business at a café?

805
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:20,857
What exactly is this duty
that we took you away from?

806
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:23,402
One more question.

807
00:47:24,653 --> 00:47:26,613
The day we failed to see Ki Du-seong.

808
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:28,657
I don't know who it is.

809
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:31,368

00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:33,412

00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:37,416

who were you talking to?

812
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,965

816
00:48:07,028 --> 00:48:07,863
Send it to me.

People with these IDs

827
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:37,559
are very friendly only for Ko and his son.

828
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:40,228
They must be his avid followers.

829
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:41,980
These politicians have fans.

830
00:48:42,063 --> 00:48:43,607
He could be the next president.

831
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,276
What if it's manipulated,
disguised as fans?

832
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:48,069
Organized fake comments?

833
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:51,531
Ye-bum, can you upload that video?

834
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,910
KO APOLOGIZES IN TEARS,
BUT WITH FAKE TEARS?

835
00:48:55,577 --> 00:48:57,412
My client, Prof. Kim Eun-suk,

836
00:48:57,496 --> 00:48:59,664
decided to take her hands off
of the legislation

837
00:48:59,748 --> 00:49:02,083
of the dating abuse law
with Assemblyman Ko.

838
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:05,086
She found out
Assemblyman Ko faked his tears

839
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,922
on the video of his public apology.

840
00:49:09,591 --> 00:49:11,968
Darn it. Get it into my eyes, will you?

841
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:13,762
Get it in there.

842
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:16,014
Hey, put in some more.

843
00:49:16,097 --> 00:49:17,724
-That's way too much.
-Some more.

844
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:20,227
I'll put this up.

845
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:23,271
You need to get here.

846
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,482
-Put it on the floor.
-Yes.

847
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:27,567
-What's with your handwriting?
-Stay still.

848
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:30,195
That's way too long.

849
00:49:30,278 --> 00:49:33,114
When my client found out
he shed crocodile tears,

850
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:34,533
she felt shocked in betrayal

851
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:38,036
and decided to take her hands off
of the entire legislation process.

852
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:40,121
This is what Prof. Kim wanted.

853
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:42,123
PARK GEUN-TAE

854
00:49:42,207 --> 00:49:46,002
Ko Hyeong-su and his son
have put on a huge act together.

855
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,046
Look at these comments.

856
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:52,551
You're right. These do seem suspicious.

857
00:49:53,301 --> 00:49:54,970
Hey, look at the comments.

858
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,013
This one.

859
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,641
Look at how these IDs swarm in
as if they'd been waiting.

860
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:01,101
It's suspicious.

861
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:02,185
BUT HE WORKED SO HARD

862
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,479
They all show support for Ko and his son

863
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,730
but are criticizing us.

864
00:50:05,814 --> 00:50:08,358
They're manipulating these comments.

865
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:10,902
Prof. Kim wanted to confirm this.

866
00:50:10,986 --> 00:50:13,321
But this phenomenon
can't be used as direct evidence

867
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:15,490
to prove that Ko Hyeong-su is behind this.

868
00:50:15,574 --> 00:50:18,076
And I think Prof. Yang came here
to find a lead.

869
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:19,077
Right here?

870
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,293
If you won't pick up, hang up.

871
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:29,796
If you won't hang up, pick it up.

Ko Hyeong-su isn't your fight.

What?

880
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:08,126
It's a piece of cake to destroy you.
Only you will get hurt.

881
00:51:11,254 --> 00:51:12,672
So what? Did you--

882
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:15,216
What was that?

883
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:18,428
-Look at where you are.
-What?

884
00:51:18,511 --> 00:51:19,930
It's staff only.

00:51:22,766 --> 00:51:24,267
It's not like I went in there.

00:51:25,602 --> 00:51:26,478
What's in here?

888
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:29,314
Get away.

MOLESTS HIS ADOPTED DAUGHTER

892
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,326
These are the fake news and comments

893
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:44,412
that drove Ko Hyeong-su's opponent
to death three years ago.

894
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:48,625
The IDs here are the same as the ones
who made comments on these videos.

00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,544

my uncle got from Ko Hyeong-su.

904
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:23,076
He sold the land
to Cho Tae-yeong's driver,

905
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:24,995
but Cho actually owns it.

906
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:28,039
Why didn't you stay in the police academy?

00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:34,004
Hey, Attorney Park.

00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:36,506

Damn it, these evil jerks!

918
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:05,827
How can they go on a witch hunt
for everyone?

919
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,203
This is an act of terrorism.

920
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:09,414
This is considered murder, not defamation.

921
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:10,915
Stop reading those.

922
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:11,958
Forget about it.

923
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:14,878
We have no time to lose our mind
over some malicious comments.

924
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:17,005
We might end up dead first
before catching Ko.

925
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,090
The public is against us.

926
00:53:19,174 --> 00:53:21,593
This is how he has maintained his power.

927
00:53:21,676 --> 00:53:23,887
And my dad was one of his victims.

928
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,722
We must annihilate this manipulation.

929
00:53:25,805 --> 00:53:27,015

937
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:49,746
I can't believe her.

938
00:53:54,793 --> 00:53:56,336
Why would you come here?

939
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:58,171

949
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:34,666
Are you Erica Shin?

950
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,294
Where's my sister?

951
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:42,924

Did you make the statement
on the constitutionality?

955
00:54:57,689 --> 00:54:59,732
Yes, I did that.

956
00:55:00,942 --> 00:55:02,068
I enjoyed it.

957
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:08,032
I enjoyed your take
on how it's unconstitutional.

958
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:11,077
So you're my sister's roommate.

959
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:13,538
I heard
you two are teammates for a mock trial.

960
00:55:14,455 --> 00:55:17,458
Yes. Your sister wrote it. Take a look.

961
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:35,310
I'm Prof. Kim's attorney, Park Geun-tae.

962
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:41,608
You filed a suit against my client,
Prof. Kim,

963
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:45,778
for slandering you in court
during the Bad FaMa trial.

964
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:49,449
Right, have you been paying
your child support?

965
00:55:52,202 --> 00:55:54,787
Sorry. I just get very curious.

966
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:56,623
Aren't you?

967
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:00,251
I'll let you sue me all you want.

968
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:01,920
You wanted to tell me that?

969
00:56:02,003 --> 00:56:03,296
No.

970
00:56:04,797 --> 00:56:07,050
I wanted to tell you
not to drop your suit.

971
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:17,060
Write a note that you won't drop it,
then we'll have it notarized.

972
00:56:22,523 --> 00:56:24,025
You seem a bit worn out.

973
00:56:26,527 --> 00:56:28,112
That figures.

974
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:29,614
You were framed for murder,

975
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:33,701
then you got involved
in a sex scandal with a student.

976
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,496
My gosh, Professor Yang.

977
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:44,128
I mean, I've gotten used to dealing
with absurd rumors like that.

978
00:56:44,212 --> 00:56:45,630
Why did you want to see me?

979
00:56:45,713 --> 00:56:47,757
It's not that I wanted to see you.

980
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:28,923

981
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:32,802

00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,610
It has been so long.

983
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:51,362
I wondered why you're Erica Shin

984
00:57:51,446 --> 00:57:53,948
then found out you went to the U.S.,
to your birth father.

985
00:57:54,032 --> 00:57:55,867
He's barely a father.

986
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,036
That married man had an affair with my mom

987
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:00,997
then emigrated before he found out
he got her pregnant.

988
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,291
But he still gave you a different life.

989
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,210
He's better than that scumbag stepdad.

990
00:58:06,294 --> 00:58:09,297
Just cut to the chase
and tell me why the three of us are here.

991
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,423
Let me tell you that.

992
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,592
I asked for you, prosecutor…

993
00:58:13,384 --> 00:58:16,012
I mean, professor,
I asked him to have you here.

994
00:58:22,727 --> 00:58:24,646
You must have another phone.

995
00:58:24,729 --> 00:58:26,189
I think someone's calling you.

996
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:30,943
Darn it.

997
00:58:33,237 --> 00:58:35,531
I just need to check the CCTV.
Why can't I see it?

998
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:38,242
Well.

999
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:40,119
Hey, well.

1000
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:43,081
If you won't let me see it,
I'll have to call the police.

1001
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:44,874
It's a really important flash drive.

1002
00:58:44,957 --> 00:58:46,334
It's not that I don't want to.

1003
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:48,961
It'll get more hectic with the police,
so just show us!

1004
00:58:49,962 --> 00:58:50,963

Stop shaking my sister around.

1016
01:00:05,246 --> 01:00:08,124
Let her focus on her studies
and graduate law school.

1017
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:10,126
I don't want her to be involved with you

1018
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:13,045
only to become a nuisance
for Assemblyman Ko.

1019
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:22,305
Please ask Sol
to delete the video yourself.

1020
01:00:23,723 --> 01:00:24,640
What if I say no?

1021
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:26,809
Then I'll upload a video myself

1022
01:00:27,393 --> 01:00:30,354
that my accusation of Mr. Ko
was a misunderstanding and a mistake,

1023
01:00:31,147 --> 01:00:32,648
that the letter was all fake.

1024
01:00:37,653 --> 01:00:39,363
Now that she lives in a bigger world,

1025
01:00:39,947 --> 01:00:42,784
she finally got a grasp
on how the world works.

1026
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:47,038
There was no violation
of the Election Act.

1027
01:00:49,665 --> 01:00:51,125
Why are you taking it this far?

1028
01:00:53,044 --> 01:00:55,129
She went to a juvenile hall because of me.

1029
01:00:56,964 --> 01:00:59,550
And that led to her involvement
in a scandal with you.

1030
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:01,761
I can't let her get hurt because of me.

1031
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:05,431
There's no reason for me to stay here.

1032
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:16,734
Delete her photos from the juvenile hall.

1033
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,740
Delete all malicious comments
on my sister as you promised.

1034
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:23,825
And the sex scandal.

1035
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,371

Do it.

1038
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:39,298
No way. We can't do that.

1039
01:01:39,382 --> 01:01:41,634
If we only delete her comments,
it'll be obvious.

1040
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:45,388
Hey, do as you're told.

1041
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:47,223
Do you want to end up like Lee?

1042
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:51,143
Fine, I'll do as I'm told.

1043
01:01:52,228 --> 01:01:54,647
Okay, we've been told what to do.
So let's do it.

1044
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:55,648
Okay.

01:02:34,645 --> 01:02:36,105
-Cuff them.
-Yes, sir.

1056
01:02:36,188 --> 01:02:37,857
-Hey, don't move.
-Freeze.

1057
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,066
-Stop everything.
-Hands.

1058
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,110
-Keep your hands there.
-What's going on?

1059
01:02:41,193 --> 01:02:42,236
-Freeze.
-Okay.

1060
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,738
-Be gentle.
-Don't make a move.

1061
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:45,072
I'll walk myself. Let go.

1062
01:02:45,156 --> 01:02:47,283
We should consider fake news

1063
01:02:47,909 --> 01:02:50,536
as a part of our free speech.

1064
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,664
Kang Dan,
you became a success as Erica Shin

1065
01:02:53,748 --> 01:02:56,459
all thanks to me, right?

1066
01:03:00,588 --> 01:03:02,590
I hope Yang Jong-hoon remembers that.

1067
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:05,843
I will remember that.

1068
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:07,011
KO HYEONG-SU

1069
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:08,471
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

1070
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:16,520
-We'll begin our search and seizure.
-What is this?

1071
01:03:22,985 --> 01:03:26,405
All right, now.
I'm Park Geun-tae, an attorney.

1072
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:28,783
Give me a call if this seems unfair.

1073
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:30,993
Call me, okay? Goodness.

1074
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:33,454
Here, take one.
You know me. I'm Park Geun-tae.

1075
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:34,830
RECENT CALLS

1076
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:36,290
Here you are.

1077
01:03:36,374 --> 01:03:37,667
Park Geun-tae, an attorney.

1078
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:40,211
INCOMING CALL

1079
01:03:42,129 --> 01:03:43,881
-Hello?
-Detective Jang?

1080
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:48,552
Kang Dan, you.

1081
01:03:48,636 --> 01:03:50,513
You'll have to pay for this!

1082
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:51,764
Right.

1083
01:03:51,847 --> 01:03:55,101
Ms. Kang Dan's appendix burst,
so she never got on the plane.

1084
01:03:56,102 --> 01:03:56,978
What?

1085
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:51,490
We're in the same boat, you know?

1086
01:04:51,574 --> 01:04:53,951
Are you telling me to destroy evidence?

1087
01:04:54,035 --> 01:04:56,704
Do you think I'll crumble down like this?

1088
01:04:56,787 --> 01:04:57,788
What?

1089
01:04:57,872 --> 01:05:00,124
These are all circumstantial evidence.

1090
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:01,751
We need his confession.

1091
01:05:01,834 --> 01:05:02,877
There is a way.

1092
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,879
Ko Hyeong-su doesn't trust anyone easily.

1093
01:05:04,962 --> 01:05:07,673
People like Ko may have allies,
but they have many enemies, too.

1094
01:05:07,757 --> 01:05:10,217
I'll represent you, as you wanted.

1095
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:11,343
Are you sure though?

1096
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:12,762
The law…

1097
01:05:12,845 --> 01:05:15,264
It'll punish Ko Hyeong-su
for what he did, right?
