Lei Yuzheng.

18
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,679
Sir, please follow that car.

19
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,399
You have drunk a lot.

20
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,919
Please stop drinking.

21
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,600
You again?

22
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,919
You've been following me all the way.

23
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Just leave me alone.

24
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,039
I'm worried about you.

25
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't want to see
anything happen to you.

26
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,600
Let's go home.

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Let go of me.

28
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,360
Let go of me.

29
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,399
Lei Yuzheng, you just...

30
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,479
just came back.

31
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,039
What did you say just now?

32
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,839
What did you want to say?

33
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,520
Fresh out of prison, right?

34
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,639
You don't think prison is a good word.

35
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,640
You care about my feelings,
right?

36
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,600
Du Xiaosu, I hate you!

37
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,799
I hate the way you're looking at me now!

38
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,040
What's that?

39
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,959
Sympathy?

40
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,799
No, pity me, right?

41
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
I don't sympathize with you.

42
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,079
I don't pity you either.

43
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,320
I just care about you!

44
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Because in my heart,

45
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,559
you are still Lei Yuzheng as before.

46
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,239
Are you the Virgin Mary?

47
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,880
Don't waste your time on me.

48
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,559
Why are you doing this?

49
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,200
Why do you treat me like this?

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,000
You were like this
when I went to see you.

51
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,920
Now you still treat me like this!

52
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,359
Is it so hard for you to accept my care?

53
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,040
Du Xiaosu.

54
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,000
Your care

55
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,760
for me

56
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,119
is superfluous.

57
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,720
OK. You don't have to accept it,

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,079
but I'm going to take care of you today.

59
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,239
Go home.

60
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,799
Go. Stand up!

61
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,160
Have you met my dad?

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,799
Who's responsible for
the illness of my dad?

63
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,200
It's me.

64
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,799
I made my dad get sick.

65
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,160
Can I go home without being guilty?

66
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,480
I've already told you

67
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,720
that's because of
the aftereffects of stroke.

68
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,320
You know that

69
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,920
this disease is hardly curable.

70
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,399
Go.

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,359
Go.

72
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,040
Getting drunk or not is
none of your business. Leave me alone!

73
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,559
Lei Yuzheng, you feel so sad,
guilty, and wronged.

74
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,119
I can understand.

75
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,720
But you're a man,

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,679
and you have to take
that responsibility.

77
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,760
Your father is in illness now.

78
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,359
You're here
complaining about everything.

79
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,679
Will it work to blame yourself?

80
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,200
Will your father get better?

81
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,880
Yes, it's hard for you right now.

82
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,239
But every family or every person
in the world

83
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,720
has their own difficulties.

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,559
You want to drink, right?

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,359
I'll drink with you.

86
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,359
You are crazy.

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,559
Aren't you crazy, either?

88
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,480
If you want to be crazy,
let's be crazy together.

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,119
You still don't get it.

91
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,239
I'm doing it for your own good.

92
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm always unlucky.

93
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,440
I bring misery to all who come near me.

Before, it was Zhenrong.
Now, it's my dad.

Go, and leave me alone!

I'm not leaving,

Would you like to eat marshmallow?

147
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,479
Nonsense.

148
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,599
You cannot eat Marshmallow.

149
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,359
If you eat Marshmallow,

150
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,479
who will play with me?

151
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,119
Here is the candy, Mr. Lei.

152

Marshmallow, marshmallow?

153
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,479
Dad,

154
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,559
don't you have it in your hand?

155
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,880
Yuzheng, Marshmallow that
Mr. Lei mentioned

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
is Miss Du.

157
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,200
Wait, Xiaosu.

158
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,359
What's the matter?

159
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,840
I'll talk to you when I get back.

160
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,200
I'll go and see Mr. Lei first.

161
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,119
Xiaosu, I've been holding it for days.

162
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,000
I have to tell you today.

163
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
If you don't care anymore,

164
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,520
our studio is really going to
be shut up.

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,919
Shut up?

166
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,520
What do you mean?

167
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
The real estate market
hasn't been good lately.

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,159
No one bought apartments,
and no one needed decoration.

169
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,719
If we cannot sign a new contract,

170
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,520
we will run out of money.

171
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,159
How about Mr. Liu?

172
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,679
Have you got the money from Mr. Liu?

173
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,559
Mr. Liu is always very picky,

174
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,840
and the scheme provided to him
has never been passed.

175
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,960
Let me check it out.

176
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:40,400
Yuzheng, you don't know.

177
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,960
When you were not here,

178
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,320
Miss Du took care of Mr. Lei.

179
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,719
She always bought candy for Mr. Lei.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,320
So Mr. Lei gave her a nickname,

181
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,599
Marshmallow.

182
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,719
Uncle Duan, I'm back now.

183
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,719
For this matter,

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,039
you don't need to bother Du Xiaosu
anymore.

185
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,960
OK.

186
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,320
Please rest assured.

187
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,400
Yuzheng, my son,

188
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,599
come here.

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,880
Look!

190
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,039
Lollipop, marshmallow.

191
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,239
They are all for you. Do you like them?

192
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,880
Last time,
when I was back from business trip,

193
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,559
I forgot to buy you candies.

194
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,559
You cried,

195
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,000
and almost rolled on the floor.

196
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,679
-Dad.
-It is dad's fault.

197
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,320
They are here.

198
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,760
Dad's fault.

199
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,640
Dad should buy you candies.

200
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,039
I can make it up to you
with these candies.

201
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,320
Try it.

202
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Hurry up. Have a try.

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,239
It is about to start.
It is about to start.

204
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,280
What is about to start?

205
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,039
News.

206
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:38,208
(Jiangsu TV. Jiangsu News Watch)

207
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,559
Dad,

208
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,039
it is late.

209
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,000
Can we turn it down a little bit?

210
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,000
I am watching news.

211
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,119
As an enterprise president,
we have to keep abreast of current news.

212
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,719
You're right.

213
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,320
But the news has been replayed
many times.

214
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,320
So many times.

215
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,440
You should go to bed.

216
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
I have to attend a meeting.

217
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,159
Meeting?

218
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,559
You're right!
The meeting is important.

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,239
OK, now stop watching.

220
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,239
Turn off the TV.

221
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,359
Come on.

222
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,000
Let me take you to your bedroom.

223
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,239
Why are you looking around?

224
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,960
I only look for someone.

225
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,119
Uncle Duan?

226
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,960
Why do I look for Uncle Duan?

227
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,599
I am looking for...

228
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,280
I forgot...

229
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,400
OK, dad.

230
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,359
I can't sleep unless I find her.

231
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,280
Dad.

232
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,320
Check it out.

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,479
Are you looking for them?

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Grandpa and grandma?

235
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,479
Him, or him?

236
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,080
These were your friends when you
worked in the countryside.

237
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,320
Dad.

238
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,599
Who are they?

239
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,599
Why don't I know anyone?

240
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,320
Wanhua.

241
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,159
Yes, I'm looking for Wanhua.

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
You still remember her?

243
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,679
Wanhua is my spouse.

244
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,159
I lost her. It's my fault.

245
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,640
I have to get her back.

246
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,039
Dad.

247
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,280
You know what time it is?

248
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,199
It's been many years since she left.

249
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,400
Why do you want to look for her?

250
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,719
Nonsense!

251
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,520
She was here a moment ago.

252
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,800
She just disappeared in a twinkling
of an eye. Let's go.

253
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,199
Dad.

254
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,880
I need to find her.

255
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
Where can you find her?

256
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,239
Mr. Lei.

257
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,000
What happened?

258
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,479
Marshmallow, Marshmallow!

259
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,079
Take your time.

260
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,520
OK, take it.

261
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,040
See?

262
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,680
Marshmallow is nice to me.

263
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,280
You have to take off your glasses.

264
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,760
You annoy me all the time.

265
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,680
Fine, dad.

266
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,839
I promise that I will never
annoy you again.

267
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Good night.

268
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,160
When did you get married?

269
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,880
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,319
Dad, you misunderstood.

271
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,719
Xiaosu...

272
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,319
Marshmallow is my friend.

273
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,119
She is not married.

274
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
Not married?

275
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,160
You haven't got married yet?

276
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
Why does she always stay in our home?

277
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,319
This is not good.

278
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,920
If you don't hurry up,

279
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,800
and fail to marry such a good girl,

280
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,439
I'll blame you!

281
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,959
Why don't you go?

282
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,800
Where?

283
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,280
You just said you have a meeting.

284
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,040
You are not the same as me.

285
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,079
In those days,

286
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,359
I worked and lived in the company
every day.

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,680
So I can make Yutian
become a large company.

288
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,160
No company president can be
as relaxed as you are.

289
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,199
You're right. You're right.

290
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:56,839
He is...

291
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,520
He's leaving soon.

292
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,040
Dare not listen to
what I say...

293
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,479
Please lie down.

294
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,040
If he bullies you in the future,

295
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,119
just let me know.
I'll scold him!

296
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,239
OK.

297
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,959
Well, it's time for you to sleep.

298
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Close your eyes, please.

299
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,479
Good.

300
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,920
You must be very tired today.

301
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,719
It's difficult for you.

302
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,640
It doesn't matter.

303
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,199
That's what a stroke patient
looks like.

304
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,640
Sometimes he is clearheaded,
and sometimes confused.

305
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,800
And,

306
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,040
he also loses his temper
for no reason.

307
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,839
These are normal.

308
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,920
So you have to be very patient.

309
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,119
You have to be mentally prepared.

310
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,040
My dad is everything to me now.

311
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,439
He's the only family member I have left
in the world.

312
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,040
I have to take care of him
no matter what.

313
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,959
Is she your mom?

314
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,680
Your mom is so pretty.

315
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,640
She should be a lady of a big,
noble family,

316
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,359
and she is very graceful.

317
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,439
I just heard that

318
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,560
my grandpa's family was well-known
in the south of the Yangtze River.

319
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,199
My mother is
the apple of their eye.

320
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,119
When my dad met my mom,

321
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,439
he was a poor student.

322
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,439
Their marriage

323
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,160
was strongly opposed by
my grandpa and grandma.

324
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,400
Your mother must love
your father deeply.

325
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,160
This is how it was at the beginning,

326
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,079
but as my father became increasingly
busier at work,

327
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,119
they started to quarrel.

328
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,439
More and more terrible quarrel.

329
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,640
Forget it!

330
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,599
Let's not talk about this.

331
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,040
In fact, the younger generation like us

332
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,520
is hard to judge the love of
the older generation.

333
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,839
Who would ever think,

334
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,239
Aunt Shao was my father's first love.

335
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,199
Thus, she was so against
me and Zhenrong.

336
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,079
But to be honest.

337
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,959
I never blamed her.

338
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,079
I can only say that
the destiny makes fool of the people.

339
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
For the past,

340
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,040
we didn't know everything well,

341
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,560
and the future is difficult to control.

342
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,119
So it's better to be optimistic
at the moment,

343
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,000
and take good care of the people
around you.

344
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,040
Sorry for saying too much.

345
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,520
Your studio just opened.

346
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,319
You must have a lot of work to do.

347
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,439
You don't need to worry about my dad.

348
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,839
Lei Yuzheng.

349
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,040
I don't like what you just said.

350
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,680
I am willing to take care of Mr. Lei.

351
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,880
Tomorrow, I

352
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
will still come over to see Mr. Lei.

353
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,319
I have to go.

354
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,599
Mr. Lin.

355
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,439
Look at He Qunfei.

356
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,280
I didn't expect that
the former president's assistant

357
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,079
would end up like this.

358
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,680
Lei Yuzheng is in such a situation.

359
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,839
I think he should regret it very much.

360
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,800
That's why he would rather
work here as a cleaner

361
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
than leave.

362
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,160
It's good to have him around.

363
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,079
I want He Qunfei to know that

364
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm now

365
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,000
the real person in charge of Yutian.

366
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,959
I agree with you.

367
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,640
Wait, Qunfei.

368
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,400
This place is quite spacious.

369
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,160
Your work is not busy.

370
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,719
Clean it up, Qunfei.

371
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,319
Sort these items out,

372
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
and clean them up.

373
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,719
Remember to clean them up!

374
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:54,719
Qunfei, when you were with Lei Yuzheng,

375
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,760
I think you are very good.

376
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:02,280
Reliable, hard-working
and uncomplaining.

377
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,959
You'll only be a cleaner for a while.

378
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,680
I'll assign you decent jobs.

379
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,719
But don't worry.

380
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,160
I will not waste your talent.

381
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
Yes, Mr. Lin.

382
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,680
As you said before,

383
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,880
if Qunfei can work for us
someday,

384
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,199
that would be perfect.

385
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,359
Now, it comes true.

386
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,479
Mr. Lin and Mr. Xie,

387
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,920
I never fear hardship.

388
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,680
You let me clean the bathroom.

389
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:48,680
No problem. I will do it.

390
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,479
I also promise to do better than others.

391
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,719
But if you let me enter
Mr. Lei's office.

392
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,319
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,119
I can't do it.

394
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm sure Mr. Lei will come back

395
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,839
one day.

396
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Now, I, He Qunfei,

397
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,000
submit my resignation.

398
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,839
He Qunfei, think it over.

399
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,280
If you leave Yutian

400
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,800
and want a new job,

401
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,520
it would not be easy.

402
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:27,079
Qunfei,

403
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,880
I didn't know why I had offended you.

404
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,239
Now that you've decided to go,

405
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,400
I will not stop you.

406
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,040
I've always treated you as my buddy.

407
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,199
If you want to come back one day,

408
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,079
you're always welcomed here.

409
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,319
Mr. Lin,

410
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,439
rest assured.

411
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,280
Even if I become a beggar,

412
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:50,199
I won't come back.

413
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,760
Here comes the stuffing.

414
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,319
In such a short time,

415
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:09,800
you've already rolled
so many dumpling wrappers.

416
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,239
Great.

417
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,319
Look,

418
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,839
you have to press both ends,

419
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,800
wrap around here and squeeze it.

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Like this.

421
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,839
Marshmallow, are the dumplings ready?

422
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,920
Very soon.

423
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,359
Dad, please wait.

424
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,359
A watched pot never boils.

425
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,719
I don't want to eat the dumplings
made by you.

426
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,119
I want to eat the ones
made by Marshmallow.

427
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,599
Lei Yuzheng,

428
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,719
Mr. Lei favors me more.

429
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,040
You said I was messing them up.

430
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,359
I call it icing on the cake.

431
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
I don't even know why my dad is
so biased towards you.

432
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,560
Lei Yuzheng, how

433
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,599
a rich boss like you

434
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,520
can roll dumpling wrappers
and make dumplings.

435
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,079
I learned it from Aunt Shao.

436
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,920
My father loved eating dumplings
at that time.

437
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,040
But he was too lazy,

438
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
and he can't make dumplings.

439
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,920
So I stayed in Aunt Shao's home
every day.

440
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,760
And,

441
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,719
please don't call me boss again.

442
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,239
That was before.

443
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,280
I just want to live a peaceful life now.

444
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,680
Cure my dad.

445
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,439
Be a dutiful son.

446
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,000
Excuse me.

447
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,239
Who are you looking for?

448
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,319
Why you walk in directly?

449
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,359
Who are you looking for?

450
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,239
I'm a friend of Mr. Lei.

451
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,040
I want to know how he's getting on.

452
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,719
I just come and have a look.

453
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:36,760
You have to go.

454
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,040
Don't make me hurt you.

455
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,280
Lei Yuzheng.

456
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,400
Lei Yuzheng.

457
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,079
That's how you treat the guest.

458
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,000
I came to see you today

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,479
to apologize to you.

460
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,920
From your attitude,
I know I flatter myself.

461
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
But,

462
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,719
I still need to remind you.

463
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,599
You are nothing now!

464
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,520
Hot, be careful, please.

465
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
Eat slowly.

466
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,719
Cool it. Cool it.

467
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,000
OK, now.

468
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,959
You can go now.

469
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,439
Lei Yuzheng, why are you so mean?

470
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,439
I helped you make the dumplings.

471
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,239
Now it's finally cooked.

472
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,359
I don't even take a mouthful of soup.

473
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,400
You're asking me to leave?

474
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,119
Even capitalists won't treat employees
like you, right?

475
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,280
Mr. Lei, look at him.

476
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,640
He's going to kick me away.

477
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,959
You should decide who is right.

478
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,079
How dare he!

479
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,439
Ignore him. Let's have dumplings.

480
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,280
Have a seat.

481
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,520
OK, just ignore him.

482
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,680
We'll have dumplings.

483
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,839
Be careful. This is hot!

484
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,640
Take it slowly.

485
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,560
Du Xiaosu,

486
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,239
thank you for coming to help my dad
during this period.

487
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,880
At this home,

488
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,040
you are not needed now.

489
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,359
Lei Yuzheng,

490
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,920
did I say anything that
offended you?

491
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,079
I'm telling you.

492
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,479
You are burning the bridges,

493
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,719
and getting rid of me.

494
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,599
Marshmallow cannot go.

495
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,959
You can go.

496
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,920
Go.

497
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,400
Go away!

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,359
Let's eat dumplings.

499
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,560
Eat dumplings.

500
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,280
Lei Yuzheng.

501
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,680
Lei Yuzheng.

502
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,680
Lei Yuzheng, what are you doing?

503
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,959
Lei Yuzheng, what's wrong with you?

504
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,160
What are you doing?

505
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:32,760
Lei Yuzheng, you really think

506
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,839
you are a rainy day like your name?

507
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,040
Sometimes it is sunny and
sometimes gloomy.

508
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,439
Du Xiaosu, you must go today.

509
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,880
What are you doing, Lei Yuzheng?

510
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,040
Your dad is sick and so are you?

511
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,760
Lei Yuzheng.

512
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,680
Lei Yuzheng, what is wrong with you?

513
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,479
What have I done to you?

514
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,680
Lei Yuzheng,
why did you turn against me?

515
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,719
Open the door.

516
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,880
Did you hear that?

517
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,079
Brat.

518
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,400
You bring me back Marshmallow.

519
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,400
Lei Yuzheng, I know I offended you.

520
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,319
I can change if I offended you, right?

521
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,959
You have to be concerned about Mr. Lei.

522
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,839
Mr. Lei is really upset.

523
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Don't you feel bad about
making him unhappy?

524
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,040
Open the door, Lei Yuzheng.

525
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,719
I still have to remind you.

526
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,040
You are nothing now.

527
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,640
Do you still want to compete with me?

528
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,199
I know you can hear me.

529
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,199
I left the medicine in the doorway
for you.

530
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,839
Don't forget to let Mr. Lei take it.

531
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

Look at our new season's bags.

543
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,119
You really have a good taste.

544
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,199
This is made from

545
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,479
African ostrich skin.

546
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,599
It is Designer Limited Edition

547
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:54,760
that has just arrived.

548
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,160
Isn't it a little old-fashioned?

549
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,599
Look at some others.

550
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,959
Let me check out other bags.

551
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,160
Show me the red one.

552
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:08,959
Sure.

553
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,719
You really have a good taste.

554
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,920

skin tone.

555
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,760
Your skin is white.

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,239
This color is good.

557
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,359
Yes, looks bright.

558
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,079
Please try it!

559
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:21,760
Looks good?

560
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Really good.

561
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,119
You are elegant in this bag!

562
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,040
Well,

563
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,000
you're so sweet.

564
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,000
Wrap it up.

565
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:31,839
Sure.

566
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,760
I'll wrap it for you.

567
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,760
By the way,

568
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,760
your husband is very kind to you.

569
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,599
The pink bag of the new season

570
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,959
hasn't cleared customs yet.

571
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,560
He has ordered it for you directly.

572
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,119
Really?

573
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,040
Show me.

574
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,160
Why didn't I know that?

575
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,040
Sure.

576
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,280
Also, I need to confirm with you.

577
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,640
For the lock here,

578
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,599
is it right to write Meimei?

579
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,479
What?

580
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,880
Maybe we made a mistake.
(Meimei)

581
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,479
Let me show you the purchase order.

582
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,520
Pack it up.

583
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,000
Sure.

584
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,239
Have a nice day.

585
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,919
Leader.

586
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,600
How is it?

587
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:22,600
What do you feel wearing this dress?

588
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Good.

589
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,479
I know you used to be with Lei Yuzheng,

590
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,800
and spent a lot of money here.

591
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,120
But as the circumstances change,

592
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,959
you have to get used to it.

593
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,439
If you really can't do this service job,

594
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,760
just bring it up early.

595
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,719
There are plenty of people
who want to take this job.

596
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,919
You can rest assured.

597
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,879
I can do it.

598
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,560
All right. Then work hard.

599
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,239
Buddy, I owe you money?

600
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:14,840
No.

601
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,399
How could I possibly owe someone money?

602
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,479
You owe me money?

603
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,679
You are not for money. Then for what?

604
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,080
Woman?

605
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,439
You just get it?

606
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,879
Tell me.

607
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:34,959
Who?

608
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,239
Lily? Amy?

609
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,600
Or Meimei?

610
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,679
That's a lot.

611
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,560
Qunfei,

612
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,199
as a man,

613
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,120
how can you say that?

614
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,080
Moreover,

615
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,479
I don't steal,

616
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,520
rob or cheat.

617
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,719
It's all up to free wills.

618
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,199
I'm not forcing anyone.

619
00:35:58,399 --> 00:35:59,439
Tell me.

620
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,320
Who have I offended?

621
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,239
You know who you have offended.

622
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,639
He.

623
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,959
Shut up.

624
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,159
Mr. Shangguan.

625
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,120
I'm sorry.

626
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,159
It is the first day he starts work here.

627
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,639
Please forgive him
if there is anything wrong.

628
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,479
I'm telling you.

629
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,120
If it isn't for Lei Yuzheng's sake,

630
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:15,879
today, I...

631
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,000
What are you going to do today?

632
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
I'm telling you.

633
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,520
You don't have to be
for the sake of anyone.

634
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,320
Come on.

635
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,560
Let's have a fight!

636
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,719
He, are you crazy?

637
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,040
You know who this guy is?

638
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,719
You want to be fired?

639
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,879
I want to quit.

640
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:34,199
That's it. I've had enough!

641
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:37,600
He.

642
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,600
I also want to tell you.

643
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,040
If you dare hurt Siqi,

644
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,080
I'll let you know

645
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,320
what is being clingy

646
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,520
and haunting.

647
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:02,800
Mr. Shangguan.

648
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,360
It's OK.

649
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,159
Go.

650
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,040
Siqi?

651
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,959
Si... Siqi.

652
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:32,399
He Qunfei.

653
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,479
Why are you here?

654
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,840
Shangguan is also here, right?

655
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,000
Shangguan?

656
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,280
No.

657
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,800
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

658
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,840
Shall we have a dinner?

659
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,479
Is it in this room?

660
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,840
Siqi.

661
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,320
Isn't...

662
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,959
Isn't this my bag?

663
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,600
It arrives so soon.

664
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,399
Who is she?

665
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,199
My friend.

666
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,879
You have a lot of friends.

667
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,159
Siqi. Siqi.

668
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,399
Why are you here?

669
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,199
The money in my card is used up?

670
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,760
Here you are.

671
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,120
Buy whatever you want.

672
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,959
Shangguan Boyao.

673
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,879
What do you take me for?

674
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,760
Girlfriend.

675
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,639
Girlfriend?

676
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,520
I think I am just one of your girlfriends.

677
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,639
Siqi,

678
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,639
you've been with me for so long.

679
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,840
I think we

680
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,040
should have a tacit understanding.

681
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,560
What kind of tacit understanding?

682
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,520
What do you mean?

683
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,879
I...

684
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,439
I'm not like other kinds of boyfriends.

685
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,199
I can provide you a lot of things.

686
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
But,

687
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
I can't give you a promise.

688
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,679
I think our

689
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,239
relationship

690
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:12,360
should be simpler
and we should have more freedom.

691
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,199
Tell me.

692
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,120
You are not happy with me now?

693
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,280
Happy.

694
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,360
Very happy.

695
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,560
I just knew you would understand.

696
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,639
Go. Let's go inside.

697
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Sorry.

698
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,399
I'm a neat freak.

699
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,439
I think you should
keep having fun with others.

700
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,159
Siqi.

701
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Come on, buddy.

702
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,199
Freedom?

703
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,000
He only made an excuse for a playboy.

704
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,120
It was really difficult for him.

705
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,159
Why are you following me?

706
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,520
You want me to talk about you too?

707
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,479
What are you doing here?

708
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,679
Give up the work in Yutian?

709
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,719
Yes, I gave up.

710
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,719
I don't want to be annoyed
by Lin Xiangyuan.

711
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,959
That's better than working in this KTV.

712
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,439
Serving people with tea and water.

713
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:06,520
You used to be
an assistant of a president.

714
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,120
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm fine.

715
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,959
But you...

716
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:13,399
What?

717
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,879
Siqi, I saw everything.

718
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,439
