ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS, CASES
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

3
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:32,647
Is that my son?

4
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,819
Man, look. You found my son!

5
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,989
Hey, let me meet him.

6
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:44,409
He said not to look for him.
He doesn't have a father like you.

7
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:46,327
What?

8
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,705
Damn. What?

9
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:52,166
Just be satisfied with that.

10
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:55,169
What? With this?

11
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:01,634
How…

12
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,471
But what about our deal?

13
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,432
He's doing well. Isn't that enough?

14
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:10,727
As of this moment,

15
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:14,564
we don't know each other. You got that?

16
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:16,232
No.

17
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,942
I can't… Let go!

18
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,528
Let go! Damn it!

19
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,113
This isn't what you promised!

20
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:23,823
Just this photo? That's it?

21
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:29,162
What about Lee Man-ho?

22
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,167
That jerk…

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,796
That jerk…

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,007
He's insisting he must meet with you, sir.

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,509
Me? Why?

26
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:48,389
No.

27
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,516
Tell me. Say it!

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,976
Tell me!

29
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,522
He said he doesn't know
what he'd blurt out if you refused.

30
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:57,899
Blurt out what?

31
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,943
He said he'd tell you in person, sir.

32
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,028
That psycho.

33
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:06,616
I can't believe
you're actually relaying this message.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,412
Who cares what that scumbag says?
Must I deal with his bullshit?

35
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,083
Understood, sir.

36
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,795
He's just a piece of trash
that should've been dumped

37
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,047
a long time ago.

38
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,548
Say it. Tell me!

39
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,133
Step aside. Take him to the OR.

40
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:25,051
Just a moment.

41
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,427
-Take him.
-Tell me.

42
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:28,304
Just a moment.

43
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:29,639
-Blood type?
-O-negative.

44
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:32,391
-Since it's rare--
-I have the same blood type.

45
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,439
The first hearing of Jin,
the first prosecutor who was to be tried

46
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:41,317
for publicizing facts
about a suspected crime,

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,860
ended in less than five minutes

48
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:44,821
as Jin, the defendant in this case,

49
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:48,324
has requested a constitutional review
questioning the constitutionality

50
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:51,077
of Article 126 of the Criminal Code.

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,036
What?

52
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:54,497
A constitutional review?

53
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:56,124
What a bummer.

54
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,792
I expected no less from Jin.

55
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,253
He's questioning
the constitutionality of the law?

56
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:03,297
It infringes on the public's right
to know?

57
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:06,092
So Article 126 of the Criminal Code
is unconstitutional?

58
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:09,095
If the judge accepts his request,
the trial will be put on hold

59
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,639
-until the Constitutional Court decides.
-Correct.

60
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,980
You can read this together.

61
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:20,690
You'll find it helpful.

62
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:28,322
It seemed like
you wanted to be tried in court.

63
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,199
You'll be charged, as you wanted.

64
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:33,911
Officer Cho did a great job writing
the first draft of the criminal complaint.

65
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,038
He deserves a compliment.

66
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,166
-For real?
-Well, it was…

67
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:39,917
You can definitely count on Ye-bum.

68
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,877
Seung-jae.

69
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,006
Hey, Seung-jae.

70
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,258
I'll go.

71
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,638
You drafted the criminal complaint
against me?

72
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:55,224
I wanted to praise you,
but it was quite disappointing.

73
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,643
You passed the exam,
so I had higher expectations.

74
00:03:58,853 --> 00:03:59,896
You worked so hard

75
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:01,939
for nothing.

76
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:10,448
My, this is such a bad photocopy.
It looks terrible.

77
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:14,076
They're used to the ones that I make,
so they can't read this.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,328
I can read it just fine.

79
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:21,834
He's obviously determined.

Guys, I told you to return to the office
immediately.

Do you think you can slack off

83
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:31,886
-because you think I'm a joke?
-Yes.

84
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,513
Who'd take you seriously?

85
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,598
Jeez, let's go.

86
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,766
Goodness.

87
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:37,975
Hey, about that…

88
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,439

<i>This is Yang Jong-hoon.</i>

95
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:25,940
Give me a second.

96
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,276
Let me call you back.

YANG JONG-HOON

101
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,683
You're going to turn yourself in?

102
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,605
Don't you think it's too late for that?

103
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,232
Why didn't you do it

104
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,652
right after the accident
if you were going to do it anyway?

105
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,158
You're right.

106
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:27,209
Then you didn't have to accept my argument
that I was feeble-minded.

107
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:31,088
But thanks to that,
you became a chief prosecutor.

108
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:32,048
And the bribes…

109
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,760
I mean, you received that "gift" as well.

110
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:37,053
Oh, dear.

111
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,851
Right, the reason I wanted
the chief prosecutor title…

112
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,272
I had totally forgotten about it.

113
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,031
I wanted to make sure
shameless scumbags like you

114
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,949
would never be able to disgrace the law.

115
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,534
But look at this.

116
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:05,706
I should've made you rot in jail forever,
but just to cover up what I did,

117
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,710
I let you stand right before me now.

118
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,385
What about Assemblyman Ko?

119
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,357
Mr. Lee, can you hear me?

120
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,569
Oh, please don't get up.

121
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:36,570
Doctor!

122
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:39,782
ECG, SPO2

123
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:41,992
-It's an arrest.
-Epinephrine, 2ml.

124
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,577
-And the defibrillator.
-Got it.

125
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,870
Undress him. Quick!

126
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,288
Charge to 120 joules.

127
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,332
Cleared. Shock!

128
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,168
Charge to 200 joules.

129
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,045
Cleared. Shock!

130
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:55,756
One more time. Charge to 200 joules.

131
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,508
Cleared. Shock!

132
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,807
ECG, SPO2

133
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,613
Hurry up, will you? Jeez.

134
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:24,493
What the hell? What happened?
Who did this?

135
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,830
Crap! I just got my car washed yesterday.

136
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:30,040
This car should be scrapped, not washed.

137
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:32,710
He decided to represent Lee Man-ho
knowing the risks

138
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:35,004
just to put his name on the map
as a lawyer.

139
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,047
So I'm sure he expected this much.

140
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,091
They'd better remember my name after this.

141
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,845
Who's calling? Goodness.

142
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:45,890
Hello, Lawyer Park Geun-tae speaking.

143
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:47,516
Yes, speaking.

144
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,226
What?

145
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:57,109
The disciplinary committee will make
the final decision tomorrow.

146
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:00,196
You're under investigation
by the prosecution,

147
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,823
so they're leaning toward expulsion.

148
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,203
But I'm going to push
for permanent exclusion.

149
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:13,959
I'm sure you know the difference
between expulsion and permanent exclusion.

150
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:19,215
It means you can never apply
for law school again.

151
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:25,346
Right.

152
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:29,600
The fact that you were the culprit
behind such unethical hacking

153
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:33,687
means that you are not qualified
to work in law.

154
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:35,856
Right.

155
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:39,527
All right.

156
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:44,782
You can resent me all you want
for not asking the school for leniency,

157
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,536
but let's keep in touch.

158
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:03,300
JU-YEONG

159
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,220
Shouldn't you pick it up?

160
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,098
MISSED CALLS

161
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:15,229
Permanent exclusion
will be deemed excessively harsh,

162
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:18,983
so it'll be a mitigating factor that could
get you probation instead of jail time.

163
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:23,445
Prof. Kim used to be a judge,
so she knows the drill.

164
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,239
I guess she was really fond of you.

165
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,953
I came to ask what will happen with me.

166
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,622
My results will also come out tomorrow.

167
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:35,874
You'll be fine.

168
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,543
I'm not sure.

169
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:41,630
Unlike you, the professors aren't really
fond of me. So who knows?

170
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,508
I'm off.

171
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:58,397
STAFF ONLY

172
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:08,866
You're here.

173
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,117
Because of Lee Man-ho?

174
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,369
He died.

175
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,038
Lee Man-ho is dead?

176
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,331
Who stabbed him?

177
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:17,916
Ki Du-seong, the guy who stabbed you.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,170
He's also being treated
at this hospital now.

179
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:24,131
But he said it happened
while he was trying to defend himself

180
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:27,092
from Lee's attack.
He's insisting he acted in self-defense…

181
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,263
Was he always like that?
Hold grudges and all?

182
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:32,556
Well, we accused him of murder.

183
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,267
Do you want to see Ki?
You can't, if you go alone.

184
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:38,812
Lee Man-ho is…

185
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:40,689
dead?

186
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:47,905
This is all your fault, Prosecutor Yang.

187
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:50,658
Because you wanted to know
who ordered me to kill you.

188
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,827
Lee Man-ho was the one
who ordered you to kill me?

189
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,872
That scumbag attacked me
as soon as he arrived in jail

190
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,249
to get back at me for betraying him.

191
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,961
You should've made sure
he would be kept away from me.

192
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,381
That asshole stabbed me,
and I nearly died.

193
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:06,632
He died.

194
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,303
Lee Man-ho is dead.

195
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,640
Well…

196
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,393
I didn't think he'd even die.

197
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,021
So what?

198
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:23,315
I felt like he was going to kill me.

199
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,567
He brought it upon himself.

200
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:32,908
Have you checked whether that's true?

201
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:36,328
Yes, it is true that Lee
had a knife on him.

202
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,247
Even the last time he was in jail,

203
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,374
he secretly kept a knife
to protect himself.

204
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:42,376
Although he never attacked anyone then.

205
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,379
He got arrested again
because Ki ratted him out,

206
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:48,465
so it's understandable
that he had a grudge against Ki…

207
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:58,559
What? He's dead?

208
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:02,312
-What about the trial?
<i>-Oh, it ended hours ago.</i>

209
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,273
I guess you didn't see my text yet.

210
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:08,193
Prosecutor Jin has requested
a constitutional review.

211
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:09,987
<i>The kids are flipping out.</i>

212
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,406
-But it'll likely be rejected.
-It'll be accepted.

213
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:14,700
What? It'll be accepted?

214
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:16,618
Yes, if it's Judge Oh Jun-hyeop.

215
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:17,536
Goodness.

216
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:21,540
There you are. I was wondering
why you weren't at the trial.

217
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,710
Sounds like you heard about how it went.

218
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,920
I heard Lee Man-ho is dead.

219
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,380
Go speak with Ki first.

220
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,883
I heard he almost got stabbed first.

221
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,802
If Lee had planned to stab Ki
to get back at him,

222
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:36,889
then why did he call me right before that
and ask me to visit him?

223
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:37,806
He did?

224
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,184
He said he'd tell me
who ordered him to kill Seo.

225
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:41,685
He was ordered to do it?

226
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:45,355
You've clearly lost your touch
as a prosecutor.

227
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,484
He obviously said that
hoping to get his sentence reduced--

228
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:51,361
He waged a knife fight
when he wanted a lighter sentence?

229
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:52,821
In the heat of the moment--

230
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,782
You said the same thing about me.

231
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,161
Don't trust your gut
as it has proved unreliable.

232
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,871
Investigate thoroughly.

233
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:03,999
Will do.

234
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,543
Ki's room is that way.

235
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:10,214
Do not miss anything.

236
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:14,635
It's possible that someone put
both Ki and Lee up to it.

237
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:18,472
Look, we dropped the charges against you.
Just go teach your students.

238
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,849
-Don't let anyone toy with you.
-Enough.

239
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,142
Don't be like me.

240
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:26,730
Someone's toying with me now.

241
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:49,711
Prof. Yang.

242
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:51,797
I heard Lee Man-ho died.

243
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,174
-Who did this?
-Ki Du-seong.

244
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,428
-Ki Du-seong?
-He claims that Lee tried to kill him.

245
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:00,764
Why would Lee try to kill him?

246
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:04,101
According to Ki, Lee was the one
who had ordered him to kill me,

247
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:08,438
but he ratted Lee out.
That's why Lee wanted him dead.

248
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:10,691
Jeez, I don't believe that.

249
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,902
Ki Du-seong lies every time
he opens his mouth.

250
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:16,530
That sly jerk has even tried to manipulate
his attorney.

251
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,948
What?

252
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,409
I'm being bashed for representing Lee,

253
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,744
but Ki's become a hero.

254
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:24,913
I heard you visited Lee in prison.

255
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,625
Yes, once. But…

256
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:29,960
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

257
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:32,462
About that… Hey, Sol.

258
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:34,423
Tell him about our visit.

259
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,841
This is an important call.

260
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:38,468
Park Geun-tae speaking.

261
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,805
He's not at the academy?

262
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:43,682
Right.

263
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:47,394
Are you relieved now that
you don't have to defend a criminal?

264
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:54,026
People are petitioning the Blue House

265
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:57,321
for the legitimacy
of my self-defense argument, I hear.

266
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:00,532
Because I gave Lee Man-ho the punishment
he deserved,

267
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:03,035
which the law had failed to do.

268
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:05,078
Are you sure he attacked you first?

269
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:10,125
Jeez, can you not gauge the situation?
Public opinion is already on my side.

270
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,129
Don't waste your time checking the facts.

271
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:18,300
Just admit that I acted in self-defense
so we can be heroes together.

272
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:20,677
You're the one
who can't gauge the situation.

273
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,514
If you're going to pull this on me,
I must dig and check the facts.

274
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,685
It's no fun to be toyed around with
in the court of public opinion.

275
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:41,323
Is Prosecutor Jin just lucky or what?

276
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,283
Judge Oh's doctoral thesis.

277
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,534
OH JUN-HYEOP

278
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,203
DOCTORAL THESIS

279
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:49,581
"The law on publication of facts
of suspected crime should be abolished."

280
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:52,167
It's almost identical
to Prosecutor Jin's argument.

281
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:56,880
-Can't we request a new judge?
-It's not related to the case.

282
00:16:56,964 --> 00:17:00,050
It's just the judge's opinion,
so the request won't be accepted.

283
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:02,844
Then what now?

284
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:06,932
Prosecutor Jin's request will probably
be accepted since they agree on this.

285
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,977
Then the trial will be put on hold
until the Constitutional Court

286
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,228
makes its decision.

287
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:13,230
That's right.

288
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:14,940
Talk about a string of bad luck.

289
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:20,279
-And the thesis advisor was…
-Prof. Kang Ju-man.

290
00:17:22,197 --> 00:17:23,490
It was my dad.

291
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,849
He asked me if I was relieved now
that I don't have to defend a criminal.

292
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,497
You should've snapped at him and asked,
"Must you make me feel even worse?"

293
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:14,624
I thought I'd be relieved.

294
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:19,004
I am relieved.
He never repented, even post-release.

295
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:22,966
What's with that conflicted look?

296
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,387
Shouldn't we tell his son?
I mean, his father died.

297
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:29,806
His son?

298
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,476
He was looking for his son.

299
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:34,770
That's why he moved to my area.

300
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:36,688
I thought you were looking for your son.

301
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,482
And you wanted him to see this?

302
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:39,566
My gosh!

303
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:51,578
Why don't you just bring me the photo?

304
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:53,497
Photo?

305
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,500
-What photo?
-Let me use your phone.

306
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,378
You know phones aren't allowed in here.

307
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,796
-Darn it.
-Oh, right.

308
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:03,507
They knew we were visiting you,
so they were extra strict.

309
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,926
They're usually not like this
with attorneys.

310
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:07,177
Who do you need to call?

311
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:09,721
Choi Jae-cheol?

312
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:12,474
He got out on bail.

313
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,227
His big shot lawyers
showcased his repentance

314
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,187
and his contribution to catching you.

315
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,605
Damn it!

316
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,525
Let me make a quick call.
Hand me your phone!

317
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,151
We don't have our phones now!

318
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,069
No.

319
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:27,280
That scumbag.

320
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:29,199
Bastard…

321
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,119
Get me the photo.

322
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:33,703
Now.

323
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:36,915
The photo of my son.

324
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:39,167
-Photo of his son?
-Yes.

325
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,128
I think it was a recent photo.

326
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:44,881
That means the person who gave it to him
knows where his son is now.

327
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:48,009
Right, the person who gave him the photo
must know.

328
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:53,223
Guys, did you hear?

329
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:56,435
Lee Man-ho. He's dead.
It's all over the Internet.

330
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:58,895
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

331
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:03,733
Professor, about Lee Man-ho…

332
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,527
Even if Ki had betrayed him,

333
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,155
he would've never caused
such trouble in jail.

334
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:24,171
SON

335
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,506
This is his son.

336
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,759
I found it at his place.

337
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:32,512
Look at the date on it.
It was taken recently.

338
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,723
He would've behaved himself for his son.

339
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:37,392
If anything,
he would've begged you to help him

340
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:39,686
get his sentence reduced
like you did with Ki.

341
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,271
I wonder who gave him this.

342
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:44,232
There's something strange.
I called Detective Oh on my way here.

343
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:47,027
He said they didn't find the photo
when searching his home.

344
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:51,114
The person who gave him this photo
must be very thorough.

345
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:55,702
I got the impression that he wanted
to call the person who gave him the photo.

346
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:58,997
The moment I saw this photo,
I realized my hunch was wrong.

347
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,751
I think he killed my uncle
and tried to kill you as well

348
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,504
because someone put him up to it.

349
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,005
Someone ordered him to do it.

350
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:09,841
And you think Lee's son was the reason
why he did it?

351
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,969
What if the person who gave him the photo
used his son to--

352
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:14,554
To instigate him?

353
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:15,805
-I think so.
-I think so.

354
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:19,851
Who would've been most shocked
had your uncle turned himself in?

355
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:20,852
Me.

356
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,229
And you.

357
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,189
Who would've taken the biggest hit?

358
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,816
The person who used Lee's son…

359
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,235
To instigate Lee.

360
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,779
Then got rid of Lee,
who could pose a threat later on.

361
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,572
-Who could it be?
-Who could it be?

363
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:46,169

00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:51,925
07P 4295

365
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:05,563
The kid didn't die on the spot.
He was still alive after the accident.

366
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:07,565
From the standpoint
of criminal psychology,

367
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,695
don't you think he would've instinctively
got out of the car and checked the boy?

368
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:13,363
Right, that's true.

369
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:15,865
Most people would get out and check first.

370
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,744
How did I miss that?

371
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:01,828
Hey, it's me.

372
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:03,705
It's me.

373
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,207
Joon-hwi.

374
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,126
You scared me!

375
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,713
What's going on? What are you doing here?

376
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:15,592
I was hoping to find clues.

377
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,386
Have you found anything?

378
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,387
No, nothing.

379
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:23,224
What about you? What are you doing here?

380
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:25,143
What? Oh…

381
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:27,604
Don't tell me you're here for the photo
of Lee's son,

382
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:29,647
which even the cops have failed to find.

383
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,483
Of course not.

384
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:33,568
I was looking for you.

385
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,279
To ask you something.

386
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:40,450
Me? This late? You knew I was here?

387
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,744
You even have the flashlight on.

388
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:46,039
The fact that someone took the photo
after giving it to him

389
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,625
means that the person
doesn't want to be exposed.

390
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:52,337
If this person had something to do
with the hit-and-run as well,

391
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,631
maybe this person was in the car too.

392
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:59,803
Someone who would've taken the biggest hit
had my uncle turned himself in.

393
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:02,889
Do you know if someone else
was in the car with him?

394
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,726
If we know where Prof. Seo was
before the accident…

395
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:09,104
Fellow passenger.

396
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:11,564
Why did you do that?

397
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:20,407
I was on my way back from a funeral.

398
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:23,201
The funeral.

399
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:26,496
Why didn't I think of that?

400
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,131
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

401
00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:37,340
Is everything okay?

SEORIN INC.

403
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:43,346
My uncle hated people who drink and drive.

404
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,765
There must've been a reason
why he drove that night.

405
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,725
Maybe he had to give someone a ride.

00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:01,030
"Let me leave this hell."

409
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:03,283
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

410
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,326
"Let me"?

411
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:09,205
How come it's not "I want to"
or "I will leave this hell"?

412
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,000
Let me leave this room.

413
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,043
Then what about me?

414
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,588
Someone else was in the car.

What brings you here at this hour?

424
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:56,377
I heard you almost got attacked
by Lee Man-ho.

425
00:25:57,003 --> 00:25:58,463
Why do you think he died?

426
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,424
Lee Man-ho?

427
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:04,093
He got the punishment he deserved.

428
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:07,263
He killed my dear mate

429
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,974
and even tried to frame you
for the murder.

430
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,894
But now that he's been busted--

431
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:16,314
Do you know that he was looking
for his son?

432
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:19,567
Let go! Damn it!
This isn't what you promised!

433
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:22,904
Are you interrogating me now?

434
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,740
For thinking you were the killer?

435
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:27,951
Apparently, someone else was in the car

436
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:30,620
with your dear mate on the night

437
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:33,748
the Jurae-dong hit-and-run accident
took place.

438
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:38,378
Someone else was in the car?

439
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:43,591
What?

440
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:45,677
Are you hoping it was me?

441
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:50,390
You're barking up the wrong tree.

442
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,186
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have an important meeting.

443
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:02,485
You see, the Seo Byung-ju I knew

444
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,365
would've never driven off like that
after hitting a kid with his car.

445
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:11,286
55J 5757

446
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:14,872
He certainly would not have
just fled the scene

447
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:17,917
if he got out to check and saw
that the boy was still alive.

448
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,378
So what's your point?

449
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:24,132
55J 5757

450
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:29,637
Unless someone in the car
told him not to get out.

451
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:35,727
Right.

452
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,229
So don't waste your time here.

453
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:41,774
Go catch that person.

454
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:43,776
Okay?

455
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,831
So you believe someone else
was in the car with him.

456
00:27:57,332 --> 00:27:58,583
Are you sure though?

00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:15,224

462
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:34,953
Who are you?

463
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:40,875
I'm Lee Man-ho,
Prof. Seo Byung-ju's new driver.

464
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:47,215
I'd like to speak with you
regarding the hit-and-run case.

465
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:51,386
I'll take you to your destination
safe and sound.

466
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:55,932
It's okay.

467
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:57,600
Just call it a day.

55J 5757

469
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:16,411
I couldn't steal the original file,
so I made a copy in secret.

470
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:21,082
It's the dashcam footage
of the Jurae-dong hit-and-run.

471
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,794
He scrapped the car,

472
00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:29,716
but has secretly kept the footage
for some reason.

473
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:31,843
What hit-and-run?

474
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:36,556
You know that Mr. Seo caused a hit-and-run

475
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,975
in Jurae-dong a while back.

476
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:44,605
I know that you know about the accident.

477
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:47,984
It's all recorded in that footage.

478
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,281
What do you want?

479
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:10,298
If someone else was in the car,
find out who--

480
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:13,718
Did you attend a funeral
on September 10th, 2008?

481
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,219
How many years ago was that?

482
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:16,763
How would I remember?

483
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:19,307
Are you afraid it'd raise suspicion
if you remembered?

484
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,224
What?

485
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:23,269
This nutjob.

486
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:27,482
If someone else was in the car with him,
I want to know who it was!

487
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:54,175
I asked you all to gather at the scene
of Prof. Seo's murder

488
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,427
so we can take one step closer
to the truth

489
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:59,972
behind the death of Lee Man-ho
as well as the hit-and-run case.

490
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:03,101
Prof. Seo was the driver
in the hit-and-run.

491
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:05,686
But someone else was in the car with him.

492
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,356
Lee Man-ho was the only person
who knew about it,

493
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:11,317
and he had some kind of deal
with that person.

494
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,903
Then they had a falling-out
for some reason,

495
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:16,656
and if that person ordered
the murder of Lee Man-ho…

496
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,366
Sounds like we're speculating here.

497
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:19,992
Do we have evidence?

498
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:21,536
-Let's find it.
-Let's find it.

499
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,746
Jinx! You guys… Sorry.

500
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,290
If someone else was in the car with him,

501
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:28,960
then the hit-and-run is still
an unsolved case. Solve it.

502
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:37,301
If Prof. Seo was on his way home
from a funeral,

503
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:40,054
they must've gone to the funeral together
or met there.

504
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:42,598
A funeral.
Then shouldn't there be a guest book?

505
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:44,183
That's right!

506
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,686
The person's name must be
in the guest book.

507
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,480
-Nice one, Ye-seul.
-You're right.

508
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:52,650
-Going through the names in it--
-But whose funeral?

Right, Ko went to the same middle school.

00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,603
He said the person behind it
is toying with him.

527
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,979
"Toying with him"?

528
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,606
That nutjob.

529
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,985
He's digging into the hit-and-run again
with his students.

530
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,779
They're trying to find out if someone else

531
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,073
was in the car with Seo that night.

532
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,618
What's with that tone?
Do you think I was with him?

533
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,206
You're a presidential candidate.

534
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,291
If you aided and abetted
a DUI hit-and-run…

535
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:24,919
I went to the funeral
the day before the accident.

536
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:30,883
Yang Jong-hoon, that nutjob.
He still thinks he's a prosecutor.

537
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,885
How dare he try to sound me out?

538
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,971
There's no way someone else
was in the car.

539
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,098
I'm having a hard time believing

540
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,769
that Byung-ju committed a DUI.
And he was giving someone a ride? No way.

541
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:45,773
Just accept Ki's claim

542
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,194
that he acted in self-defense
and close the case.

543
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,279
Self-defense? That's--

544
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,448
Just give the public what they want.

545
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,578
Earn their support now
so you can be better prepared

546
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,665
when you get into politics down the road.

547
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,297
Right, that reminds me.

548
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,926
I'll make sure your request gets accepted

549
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:17,221
so you can defend yourself
in the Constitutional Court soon.

550
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:18,931
Just be prepared.

551
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,686
I also plan to propose the bill to abolish
the law on publication of suspected crime.

552
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:26,772
Thank you, sir.

553
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:29,775
Don't mention it.
That's what friends are for.

554
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,781
55J 5757

555
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:39,952
It's me.

556
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,872
Remember Shin Woo-seop,
my friend who died in 2008?

557
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,374
Call his wife.

558
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:54,258
OFFICER CHO YE-BUM

559
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:09,023
<i>Life feels so futile.</i>

560
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:12,735
He was a doctor.
Who knew he'd be the first one to die?

561
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,408
Gosh, they had such strong liquors
at the funeral.

562
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:28,667
We should've called a driver.

563
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:32,671
I told you that I couldn't wait for one.

564
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,715
This is my district.
I know this area well.

565
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:36,884
They never look for drunk drivers
on this road.

566
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:40,721
-I don't want to see you again.
-Goodness. Why are you so on edge?

567
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,059
This meeting is very important.
I can't be late.

568
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:47,394
Help me out just this once.

569
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,318
Yeah, I'm on my way!

570
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,447
07P 4295

571
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,870
If we get stopped, I'll deal with it.
Just hit the gas.

572
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:06,830
07P 4295

573
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,470
07P 4295

574
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,485
Let's just go.

575
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:40,239
Go. Now!

576
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:44,118
You don't want to ruin your life, do you?
Go. Just go!

577
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:54,461
07P 4295

578
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,802
This area is being redeveloped,

579
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,262
so there are no cameras here.

580
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:06,723
That was not caught on camera.

581
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,603
Hey, have you gone mad?

582
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,022
We should go back.

583
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,859
-Let go!
-Hey, no! Don't!

584
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:18,902
-Let go!
-Hey, listen to me!

585
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,864
We can't go back there now!

586
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:25,993
Byung-ju!

587
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,166
07P 4295

588
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:38,672
Byung-ju, get it together.

589
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:43,635
I must go back there.

590
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,179
You drank and drove.

591
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,474
And if that kid is dead,
you'll go to jail.

592
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,267
Do you want to die?

593
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,604
Prosecutors who end up in jail
get tortured by inmates.

594
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,195
What about your family?
What will happen to them?

595
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,500
Get out.

596
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,376
I'll drive.

597
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,046
You didn't see anything, okay?

598
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,964
Get out. Now!

599
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,549
07P 4295

600
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,678
07P 4295

601
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,188
Sir, should I take you home?

602
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,898
No.

603
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,567
I'll go to the hospital
to see Yeong-chang.

604
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,902
Yes, sir.

605
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,784
-Jeon Ye-seul!
<i>-Answer my question.</i>

606
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,704
Did your dad order you
to make me lie in court?

607
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,915
Don't drag my dad into this.

608
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,209
Soon, he'll have command
over the entire country.

609
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,126
<i>Is that why</i>

610
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,754
he tried to control me as well?

611
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:04,007
Come to your senses, will you?

612
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,635
You're a nobody.
Who cares that he tried to control--

613
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:07,761
<i>Take care.</i>

614
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:12,057
Hey.

615
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,309
Hey! Damn it!

616
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,352
God damn it!

617
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:30,367
The disciplinary committee
just made its final decision.

618
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:36,707
Winning the dissertation contest
did not affect your admission.

619
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,543
And it happened before you were admitted,

620
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:43,672
<i>so the school has decided not to take</i>
<i>disciplinary action against you.</i>

621
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:47,009
<i>But Mr. Kang feels responsible</i>
<i>for what happened</i>

622
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:49,845
<i>and keeps insisting that he should resign.</i>

623
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:52,764
<i>I don't think I can stop him.</i>

624
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,855
DOCTORAL THESIS

625
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:02,065
JUNE 2018 OH JUN-HYEOP

626
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,527
<i>You haven't published this, have you?</i>

627
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,486
KANG JU-MAN

628
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:08,322
No, why do you ask?

629
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,366
Can Sol use this?

630
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,036
For the Asia Human Rights
Dissertation Contest.

631
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,871
Don't touch my laptop.

632
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:18,915
-She should write it on her own.
-She doesn't have time.

633
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,293
She has a lot to do
to prepare for law school.

634
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,210
Then don't bother.

635
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,379
You can't even do that for your daughter?

636
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,214
-Honey.
-Forget it, Mom.

637
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:28,342
I don't agree with Dad anyway.

638
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:33,472
I don't think Article 126
of the Criminal Code is unconstitutional.

639
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:37,601
I was wondering
why you weren't publishing it.

640
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,940
PUBLICIZING CRIMINAL CHARGES
AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW

641
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,026
Looks like you let your student use it.

642
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:46,985
No.

643
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:50,238
Judge Oh Jun-hyeop

644
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,240
wrote it on his own.

645
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,201
I was his advisor.

646
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,703
So it'll go to the Constitutional Court.

647
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:04,336
DECISION

648
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:05,837
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

649
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,714
CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW REQUEST ACCEPTED

650
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,549
<i>I'm going to help Ji-ho.</i>

651
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,470
I'll prove that it's constitutional.

652
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,435
You were his advisor,
so you'll argue it's unconstitutional.

653
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,608
If I win,

654
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,530
think about why you must do this
and reconsider your decision.

655
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,951
-Sol.
-If I lose, I'll do the same,

656
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:38,662
and think about why you must do this.

657
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:57,097
About Judge Oh Jun-hyeop…

658
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,559
He and I share the exact same view
on Article 126.

659
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,394
The similarity is truly striking.

660
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,062
Look at this.

661
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,107
This sentence is exactly the same
as what I wrote.

662
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,108
Happy now?

663
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,235
Me?

664
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,741
The trial has been put on hold,
but it doesn't mean I won.

665
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,327
First, I shall skillfully handle
the Constitutional Court.

666
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:24,124
But I am excited.

667
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,879
Thanks to this,
I may end up writing a new history

668
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:31,715
of the Criminal Procedure Act
and the Criminal Code.

669
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,801
"A new history"?

670
00:42:36,344 --> 00:42:38,513
Someone died because of the info
you had leaked.

671
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,348
Your dad? That wasn't my fault.

672
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:44,060
Toxic chemicals in toys
pose a serious threat to kids' health.

673
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,522
When I heard that cancer-causing chemicals
were found in the toy,

674
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,858
I had to inform the public
before its launch.

675
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:53,445
What about the truth? You said he died
without knowing the truth.

676
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,990
Because of I-bit CEO Cho Tae-yeong
and Ko Hyeong-su,

677
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:00,869
you didn't verify whether it was true
even though you were a prosecutor.

678
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:03,580
-If you'd done--
-What's the use of talking about it now?

679
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,168
If it's ruled unconstitutional,
all of that is pointless.

680
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,634
A new history…

681
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:19,304
You will write one.

682
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:24,142
I'll make you become the first prosecutor
to be charged

683
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,521
and punished for publicizing
a suspected crime.

684
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,690
And you'll have to live with that
until you die.

685
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,449
You know, Prof. Kang Ju-man who testified.

686
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,451
The renowned constitutional law scholar.

687
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,829
I think he supports my argument.

688
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:46,248
Tell him I'll visit him soon.

689
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:53,296
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

690
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,099
I met with Shin Woo-seop's wife.
She lost the guest book while moving.

691
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:06,226
But she remembered

692
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:09,479
that Prosecutor Seo and Assemblyman Ko
didn't come on the same day.

693
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,564
Really?

694
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,525
She remembers that?
It was over a decade ago.

695
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:16,319
It was her husband's funeral, after all.

696
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,738
Can you see if you can find
my uncle's friends

697
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,534
who were at the funeral that day
and also knows Assemblyman Ko?

698
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:25,745
It's not easy to track down the guests
without the guest book.

699
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,331
We jumped through hoops
to track down a few.

700
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:31,668
Three of Seo's friends
who were at the funeral with him.

701
00:44:31,751 --> 00:44:33,628
But they're giving doubtful answers.

702
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:36,715
JURAE-DONG HIT-AND-RUN CASE

703
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:38,592
2008-GD3912

704
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:39,926
I asked him to join.

705
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,886
We owe you one anyway.

706
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,098
Not anymore.
I testified against Prosecutor Jin.

707
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:47,601
Prosecutor Jin, that man…

708
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:52,522
Who knew he'd try
to get the law itself abolished? Jeez.

709
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,983
Darn it.
What if they have it out for me now?

710
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,736
Let's hear the "doubtful" answers.

711
00:45:00,113 --> 00:45:02,907
Well, they all went
to middle school together.

712
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,869
Two of them said they only saw Seo
at the funeral,

713
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:10,915
but one of them said Seo and Ko
drank together that day.

714
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,334
They drank together?

715
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:14,836
He has early-stage Alzheimer's.

716
00:45:15,837 --> 00:45:19,215
But the thing is, the two who said
they only saw Seo that day

717
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:23,345
are both saying Ko came the day before
as if they've signed a pact.

718
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,349
They also said Seo and Ko
weren't even that close.

719
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,686
I wonder how they remember something
from over a decade ago so vividly.

720
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,273
They didn't even hesitate
and sounded very sure.

721
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,776
Maybe Assemblyman Ko contacted them
before you did.

722
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:40,737
All his friends who saw him
and my uncle that day.

723
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:45,408
If he did, that means
he knew what we were up to.

724
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,370
What? So even Ko Hyeong-su
has it out for me now?

725
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:55,563
COMPLAINT
JEON YE-SEUL

726
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:56,814
Could you submit this?

727
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:04,030
"Bodily harm, sexual assault,
unlawful surveillance"?

728
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,366
You'll file charges against Yeong-chang?

729
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:08,826
Even for incitement to perjury?

730
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,372
But you didn't actually commit perjury.

731
00:46:12,455 --> 00:46:16,167
But it can be punished if the attempt
reached commencement stage.

732
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,796
No, that does not apply to perjury.

733
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:23,675
Oh, how about coercion?
She was coerced into perjuring herself.

734
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:25,760
That and attempted perjury.

735
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:28,721
What was the article number?

736
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:32,183
Joon-hwi and Ji-ho would know it by heart.

737
00:46:32,266 --> 00:46:34,394
They have all articles and sections
memorized.

738
00:46:34,477 --> 00:46:35,895
So do I.

739
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:38,022
Coercion,
Article 234 of the Criminal Code.

740
00:46:38,106 --> 00:46:39,357
It's 324.

741
00:46:39,941 --> 00:46:44,445
Well, anyway, we may be able to get him
charged with attempted coercion.

742
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:45,947
I'll look into it.

743
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,825
I want to get Assemblyman Ko too,
for inciting coercion.

744
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:52,078
Assemblyman Ko?

745
00:46:55,998 --> 00:46:58,251
Do you have to do that?

746
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:04,966
Enjoy.

747
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:06,467
Let's eat.

748
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:09,512
I heard you never eat with your students.

749
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:11,681
You're no longer one, as of today.

750
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:13,891
Right.

751
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:16,644
I've been permanently excluded.

752
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:18,521
Mix it.

753
00:47:21,774 --> 00:47:23,985
-One <i>jjamppong</i>, please.
-Sure.

754
00:47:28,948 --> 00:47:30,158
You should ask him too.

755
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,076
REQUEST FOR SPECIAL DEFENSE COUNSEL

756
00:47:33,035 --> 00:47:34,954
Prosecutor Jin wants me to testify.

757
00:47:35,538 --> 00:47:36,414
Really?

758
00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:41,043
Right, you don't deserve an attorney.

759
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:43,004
You're on your own.

760
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:44,922
Be prepared for the witness examination.

761
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:48,384
My answers may help you or be used
against you depending on your questions.

762
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:50,303
Yes, sir.

763
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:58,478
I'll eat this because
Seung-jae ordered it for us,

764
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:01,022
but I feel bad knowing he got expelled.

765
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:02,482
Don't want it? I'll eat it.

766
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:06,152
-Let me try the <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.
-Hey, I never said I didn't want it.

767
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,321
Nice.

768
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,283
The guest book info got leaked.

769
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:15,203
Who leaked it?

770
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:17,205
Oh, where's mine?

771
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:19,832
I want lots of pickled radish.

772
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:23,127
What's going on?

773
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:24,670
There's a rat among us.

774
00:48:24,754 --> 00:48:25,671
A rat?

775
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:28,883
Just confess. Let's not waste time.

776
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:31,010
"Confess"? Come on.

777
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:32,720
That's not necessary.

778
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:35,556
As long as the person switches sides now.

779
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,768
Everyone here will be in this together
until the very end.

780
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:42,563
Even if they signed the guest book
on the same day,

781
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:45,358
it doesn't prove that
they were in the car together.

782
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:49,070
Unless someone witnessed Ko
getting into Prof. Seo's car.

783
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:51,155
The cops said they'd look into it.

784
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:53,616
The dashcam footage from the car
would be solid evidence.

785
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:56,911
Prof. Seo probably got rid of it
for that very reason.

786
00:48:56,994 --> 00:49:00,498
That's the first thing I'd get rid of
if I were in his situation.

787
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:02,708
Hey, I told you not to pour the sauce
over it.

788
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:04,377
Only you like to eat it that way.

789
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:07,547
I like it too. We'll pour it on this one.

790
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:12,552
Come on.

791
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,055
Was I too harsh
when I said he's on his own?

792
00:49:16,138 --> 00:49:17,557
You can represent him.

793
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,726
Well, I don't feel confident
that I can do as well as you did.

794
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:27,149
Oh, Attorney Park Geun-tae called me.

795
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:30,570
Looks like Ye-seul has toughened up.
She's filing charges.

796
00:49:33,072 --> 00:49:35,950
Well, about the deaths of Seo Byung-ju
and Lee Man-ho,

797
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:38,536
I think they're both connected
to Lee's son.

798
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:43,040
Remember? I was fuming mad that day.

799
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:46,586
When your son asked what you were up to,

800
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:50,339
you should've stopped
your atrocious action then and there.

801
00:49:51,382 --> 00:49:54,802
I couldn't believe he still did it
after talking to his son on the phone.

802
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,305
What are you trying to say?

803
00:50:08,858 --> 00:50:09,984
Hey, James.

804
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:13,363
<i>Hi, Prof. Kim, were you worried about me?</i>

805
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:16,991
It's okay. Nevermind.
Say hello to Prof. Yang.

806
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:19,077
He's my colleague at law school.

807
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,330
<i>Hello, Prof. Yang,</i>
<i>it's nice to meet you.</i>

808
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:24,123
<i>This is his son.</i>

809
00:50:29,378 --> 00:50:30,212
YU SEUNG-JAE

810
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:32,298
SEO JI-HO

811
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:33,382
MIN BOK-GI

812
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:48,147
Come take a seat.

813
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,818
Is this your first time here?

814
00:50:53,402 --> 00:50:55,237
-Yes, sir.
-I see.

815
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,619
The vice dean, who had your back,
has resigned,

816
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,747
and Yang Jong-hoon has returned to school.

817
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:07,833
I bet you're not pleased, Prof. Jung.

818
00:51:10,836 --> 00:51:12,046
I'd like to…

819
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:16,342
help you out and give you
all the support you need.

820
00:51:19,136 --> 00:51:20,012
KANG SOL

821
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:25,851
DAUGHTER OF VICE DEAN KANG JU-MAN
ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISM

822
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:27,687
This is…

823
00:51:28,312 --> 00:51:30,022
She needs to be taught a lesson.

824
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:32,858
She's the biggest troublemaker
at Hankuk Law.

825
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,861
Right.

826
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:38,656
But the dean is very protective of her.

827
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:43,285
The dean?
She'll be gone after her two-year tenure.

828
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:46,789
The president is the one
with the real power.

829
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,041
Speak of the devil!

830
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,213
Sit, it's okay.

831
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:55,756
Yes, sir.

832
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:03,431
Prof. Jung Dae-hyeon here
will teach those troublemakers

833
00:52:03,514 --> 00:52:04,932
a serious lesson.

834
00:52:10,938 --> 00:52:13,858
KANG SOL

835
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:14,775
NAME
DATE OF BIRTH

836
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:25,870
Good luck.

837
00:52:27,663 --> 00:52:29,874
I'll do my very best.

838
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:39,467
<i>Someone else was in Uncle's car</i>
<i>at the time of the accident?</i>

839
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:42,636
If Ko Hyeong-su was in the car
with Prof. Seo,

840
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,599
he probably took the footage instead of
letting Prof. Seo get rid of it.

841
00:52:46,682 --> 00:52:47,516
Why?

842
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,978
Being in the car at the time of
a DUI hit-and-run could ruin his career.

843
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:53,814
What if he's holding
onto the dashcam footage?

844
00:52:54,482 --> 00:52:57,026
<i>Maybe he kept it to threaten Prof. Seo</i>
<i>with it if needed?</i>

845
00:52:57,693 --> 00:53:00,196
So you think Ko Hyeong-su
has the dashcam footage?

846
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:03,449
KO HYEONG-SU

847
00:53:03,532 --> 00:53:05,367
<i>Prosecutor Jin leaked the info,</i>

848
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:07,995

<i>for inciting him?</i>

852
00:53:20,424 --> 00:53:21,425

00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:24,804
<i>Please do not forgive my betrayal,</i>

<i>stay true to your values,</i>

<i>and make sure</i>
<i>you get Ko Hyeong-su punished.</i>

00:53:57,503 --> 00:53:59,380
<i>Dan reported his election law violation.</i>

857
00:53:59,463 --> 00:54:02,800
<i>He bribed Seo Byung-ju to cover it up,</i>

858
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:05,886
<i>instigated Prosecutor Jin</i>
<i>to leak Seo Gi-yeol's alleged crime,</i>

859
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,930
<i>procured funds for the head supporter,</i>

<i>ordered Lee Man-ho to kill Seo Byung-ju,</i>

<i>He also ordered Ki Du-seong</i>
<i>to kill Lee Man-ho.</i>

863
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:21,944
<i>Why did Lee Man-ho agree to carry out</i>
<i>Ko Hyeong-su's order?</i>

864
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:26,907
<i>Assemblyman Ko was the one</i>
<i>who sent Lee's son to the US.</i>

865
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:32,955
<i>Because of his son?</i>

866
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,626
BECAUSE OF HIS SON?

00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,922

Okay, sounds good.

It's not like we can solve this

<i>He proposed a bill to abolish the law</i>
<i>on defamation by publicly alleging facts,</i>

<i>He can sue me if any of the things I say</i>

<i>A few years ago, one of his campaign staff</i>

<i>against his opponent in the election.</i>

888

Then is there anyone you can recommend?

938
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:58,095
You filed charges against me
for violating the law

939
00:58:58,178 --> 00:59:00,681

00:59:00,764 --> 00:59:04,476
Had you been indicted back then,
you could've requested this review sooner.

941
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,605
Article 126 of the Criminal Code
infringes on the public's right to know.

942

Although its objective is fair,

943
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:14,695
it fails to employ appropriate methods,
minimize damage,

944
00:59:14,778 --> 00:59:17,322

945
00:59:17,406 --> 00:59:21,452
It is unconstitutional and violates
the principle of proportionality.

946
00:59:21,535 --> 00:59:24,371
Ergo, it should be abolished.

He would not have been ruled
"feeble-minded" so easily,
