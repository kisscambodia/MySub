16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,679
Mr. Pan, for the details of
our cooperation,

17
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,360
I will ask Manager Xie

18
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,440
to email you by then.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,759
Mr. Lin is really a quick doer.

20
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
Having your words, I feel relieved now.

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,160
I heard before that Mr. Lei from Yutian
is a very able man.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
But I didn't know that
there is always someone better,

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
until I met Mr. Lin today.

24
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,479
You're flattering me!

25
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,520
Happy cooperation!

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
OK. Happy cooperation!

27
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,319
OK.

28
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,479
Come with me, please.

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,319
Xiangyuan?

30
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,640
Are you Lin Xiangyuan?

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,560
Who are you?

32
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,039
You didn't recognize me?

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
I can tell now.

34
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,239
Who am I?

35
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,920
Mengnan, Li Mengnan!

36
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,599
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,360
What brings you to shanghai?

38
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,640
I'm here for business.

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,839
Come, come, come!
I'll take you out to dinner!

40
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,759
OK.

41
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,640
I haven't put my suitcase down yet.

42
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,200
Mrs. Fanlv, when I was doing laundry,

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,239
I found this in Mr. Lin's pocket,

44
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,759
wondering if Mr. Lin still needs it.

45
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,719

(Li Mengnan)

47
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,640
Not bad.

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
This is my husband.
A technician from IT field.

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,440
When I arrived in Tianjin,

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
he started going after me.

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,599
Next to him is my son.

52
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,520
He is five years old
and his name is Dudu.

53
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,879
You're so happy. Such a perfect match!

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,479
And you also have a lovely son.

55
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,599
No need to be envied.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,680
Didn't you get married
and have children?

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,680
Xiangyuan.

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,279
Xiangyuan,
you are asked to send some photos.

59
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,759
Your wife's photos.

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,479
What happened?

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
You are not married?

62
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,800
My wife is from Shanghai
and her surname is Jiang.

63
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:43,999
She is just pregnant.

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,999
Her dad and I work in the same company.

65
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,479
He is the chairman of the company.

66
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,240
Chairman?

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Until now, I just figured out that

68
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,920
you're working for your father-in-law.

69
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,279
Well, not bad, Lin Xiangyuan.

70
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,479
Not only earning money from Shanghai,

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,479
and even married with
a wealthy fair belle from Shanghai.

72
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,400
We are really proud of you!

73
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,680
OK, let's not talk about this.

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,999
How long are you planning to
stay in Shanghai this time?

75
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,840
How about I take you around in Shanghai?

76
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,080
If you need any help in Shanghai,

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,719
just feel free to let me know.

78
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,640
Well, I really need your help now.

79
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,680
This time, I came to
Shanghai from Tianjin

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,279
for business.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,680
But I don't know their boss very well.

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,599
So, I want you to go with me and
give me some advice.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,439
OK, no problem.

84
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,159
It's my pleasure.

85
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,400
-Thank you.
-Cheers!

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,999
This way, please.

87
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,319
OK, thank you.

88
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,479
Please wait here,

89
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,999
and our president will come very soon.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
OK, thanks.

91
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,540
(In the Meeting. Keep Quiet)

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,680
Mr. Shangguan, I'm Li Mengnan.

93
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,559
Nice to meet you.

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,800
We talked before over the phone.

95
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Nice to meet you, Ms. Li.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,719
Nice to meet you.

97
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,240
Sorry, this is?

98
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
This is my friend, Lin Xiangyuan.

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,120
He is the president of Yutian Group.

100
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,599
Oh, Mr. Shangguan.

101
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,840
You are a big shot and
I guess you wouldn't mind

102
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,360
I bring my friend here

103
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,479
to give some advice.

104
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,400
President of Yutian Group.

105
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,719
He should be the big shot here.

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,879
He's more than welcome to be here.

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
Right, Mr. Lin?

108
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,680
Nice to meet you.

109
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,080
Nice to meet you.

110
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,879
Then, let's start now.

111
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,120
Please introduce the project, Ms. Li.

112
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,520
Sure.

113
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,879
(Slow Enough, Beautiful Enough)

114
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,599
Siqi, why are you still there?

115
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm waiting for Shangguan
to pick me up.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,120
You go first.

117
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Will Shangguan drive Mercedes

118
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
or Land Rover today?

119
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,960
You are out of date.

120
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,479
I saw it last time.

121
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,360
Shangguan just changed to a new Volvo,

122
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,159
and took Siqi out for a drive!

123
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,360
Really?

124
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,319
Volvo?
(Home Magazine)

125
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,999
I've never been in a Volvo.

126
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,599
Maybe I was wrong.

127
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,279
I just saw a woman on passenger seat,

128
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,599
also with short hair.

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,759
The car was very fast.

130
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,479
I thought it was you.

131
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,960
Well, I'm leaving now.

132
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
Bye.

133
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,599
Bye, Siqi.

134
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,680
This idea is ultramodern.
(Zou Siqi)

135
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,520
Glass curtain wall with the steel frame
structure as the main structure

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,759
coupled with the curved and
variable bending shape,

137
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,039
undoubtedly adds a strong modern style

138
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,039
to the entire Shanghai architecture.

139
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,200
Taking the advantage of Huangpu River,

140
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,080
geography and shape,

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,120
the building will
leave a very strong stroke.

142
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,879
Mr. Shangguan.

143
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,759
Mr. Shangguan?

144
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,200
What do you think?

145
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
You're done?

146
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,559
I think this project is very good.

147
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,999
Personally, I'm very satisfied with it.

148
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,120
But I have a little question.

149
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,159
During our cooperation this time,

150
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,279
will Mr. Lin join in?

151
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:29,640
To tell you the truth,

152
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,520
Xiangyuan is really a business expert.

153
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm about to invite him to our project

154
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,919
and give some advice.

155
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
Really?

156
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,559
Yes.

157
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,720
That's great!

158
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,919
But... if this is the case,

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,919
I have to reconsider

160
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,559
the cooperation between us.

161
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,239
What do you mean?

162
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,999
Lin Xiangyuan, Mr. Lin,

163
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,040
I've heard of his name for a long time.

164
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,520
In the beginning,

165
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,200
he was sent by Boyuan Company to
Yutian as an outside help.

166
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,359
But during that period of time,

167
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
he replaced Lei Yuzheng.

168
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,280
And by pestering again and again,

169
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,879
he finally got Miss Jiang.

170
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,879
In the end,
he suddenly changed his identity

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,799
to the president of Yutian.

172
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,999
Such scheming mind and means

173
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,600
are really admirable.

174
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,160
Mr. Lin, how did you make it?

175
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,520
Teach me.

176
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,759
So, Ms. Li,

177
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,439
if Mr. Lin is also involved

178
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,280
in this project,

179
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,679
in the end, I may be
kicked out unconsciously

180
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,160
as well.

181
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,919
Who am I going to cry to by then?

182
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,040
Ms. Li,

183
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,319
you have to be responsible to me then.

184
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Excuse me,

185
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,040
Lei Yuzheng?

186
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,040
Who is Lei Yuzheng?

187
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,559
I didn't get you.

188
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,919
Shangguan,

189
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,840
don't get other people
involved in our feud.

190
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I can promise you that

191
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,999
I won't interfere in this cooperation,

192
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:07,280
if you cooperate with Mengnan.

193
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,600
Now, you start being
kind and nice to friends.

194
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,119
But it's a pity.

195
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,879
I know what kind of person you are.

196
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,480
I knew it long time ago.

197
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,720
Ms. Li,

198
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
I can't trust this person

199
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,400
and I also advise you
to stay away from him.

200
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,080
Be careful. Otherwise,
you may be betrayed someday

201
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,160
and won't even be aware of that.

202
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,559
Mr. Shangguan,

203
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,080
if you do not have confidence
in our cooperation,

204
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,640
Wenxing won't force it.

205
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
But,

206
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,080
please respect my friend.

207
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Thank you.

208
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,840
Xiangyuan, let's go.

209
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,759
Bye and take care.

210
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,559
Xiangyuan,

211
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,640
why did Shangguan Boyao
judge you in that way?

212
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,879
Who is Lei Yuzheng?

213
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,600
Mengnan,

214
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,480
I haven't had the time to tell you.

215
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,720
Lei Yuzheng is the former president
of our company.

216
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,559
Because of a case,

217
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,119
he is in jail now.

218
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
At that time, the company was a mess.

219
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,679
I was entrusted at that time,

220
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,280
and became the president of the company.

221
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,999
Shangguan and Lei Yuzheng
grow up together.

222
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,919
He thinks I robbed
Lei Yuzheng's position.

223
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,720
So, no matter what I explained,
he still doesn't buy it.

224
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,200
He is too bully!

225
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,679
Lei Yuzheng went to prison.

226
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
You became the president instead of him.

227
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,640
That is because you have the ability.

228
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,200
Mengnan,

229
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm sorry to let you
come here for nothing.

230
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,679
Why not you give me
your project proposal?

231
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
I'll help you figure out a solution.

232
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,679
I have said it's fine.

233
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,280
Don't be so fussy.
What are you doing as a big man?

234
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,759
OK.

235
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,439
How about this?

236
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,080
You take me around in Shanghai

237
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,679
these two days,

238
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
since now I have nothing to worry about.

239
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,600
Sure.

240
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,799
Let's go!

241
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,619
(Zou Siqi)

242
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:37,919
Hello. What do you mean?

243
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,679
Why didn't you call me the whole day?

244
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm sorry, Siqi. I'm very busy today.

245
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,080
Again? Are you too busy
to even make a call?

246
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,960
Shangguan.

247
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,200
Hang up?

248
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm here today to tell you that

249
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,879
I helped you out!

250
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,200
What happened?

251
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,600
The story goes like this.

252
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,559
There is a lady,
who looks pretty by the way.

253
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,359
She wants to cooperate with our company.

254
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
But she came with Lin Xiangyuan.

255
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Guess what?

256
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,520
Can I pass up such an opportunity?

257
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,319
Right in front of this lady,

258
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,759
I gave Lin Xiangyuan a horrible meal.

259
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,600
In the end, I decided to
terminate the cooperation.

260
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,319
She has no rancor against you.

261
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,559
Why did you do that?

262
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,559
Because she is a friend
of Lin Xiangyuan.

263
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,960
How unlucky she is!

264
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,200
Buddy, after all,

265
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,840
what I can make now
is only small troubles

266
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,239
I'm waiting for the day you come out.

267
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,119
Let's do something big.

268
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,439
Let's do something big.

269
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:58,879
Stop it.

270
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,879
Don't say that again in the future.

271
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm now a prisoner

272
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,400
and have no plan for the future.

273
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,840
And Shangguan,

274
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,679
here is not a good place,

275
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,799
don't come to see me
in the future anymore.

276
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,359
When I'm out, let's get together.
I'm leaving now.

277
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,720
Buddy.

278
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,640
Go.

279
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,600
Go back.

280
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,640
Go back.

281
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,439
Xiangyuan, thank you these days

282
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,239
for taking me around.
It must waste you a lot of time.

283
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,280
In fact,

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,879
I should thank you.

285
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,480
I have been working in Shanghai
for such a long time

286
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,840
and these days are
the happiest and most relaxed moments.

287
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
If it wasn't because of you,

288
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,280
I have almost forgotten
what smile should be like.

289
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,359
Xiangyuan, in fact, there's a question

290
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,640
I always wanted to ask you.

291
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,080
How are you doing in Shanghai?

292
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,919
Mengnan, I remember

293
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,679
we met each other
in a townsmen gathering.

294
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,640
I remember that day
we talked until very late.

295
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,280
You said that, after you graduate,

296
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,919
you want to get married
and become a mom.

297
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
You want a family.

298
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,559
I said I must stay in Shanghai
after I graduate and

299
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,879
work in the best office building.

300
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,879
I must be a successful person

301
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,239
and have the best things in the world.

302
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,280
Then...

303
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,919
Then marry your most favorite lady.

304
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,359
Actually, I still remember

305
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,080
the way you said that.

306
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,799
There was light in your eyes.

307
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,999
Since then,

308
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,080
Xiangyuan,

309
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,720
I have been having the faith that
you will definitely be successful.

310
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,640
Mengnan, I want to ask you.

311
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,080
What is success?

312
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,999
Look at me now.

313
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,799
I am rich. I have a nice car,
a nice apartment,

314
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,239
and a rich wife.

315
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,319
These are what other people dream of.

316
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,319
But to be honest,

317
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm not happy at all now.

318
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,879
Sometimes, when I stay with her,

319
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,400
we even have no common topic.

320
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,160
I also feel pretty boring.

321
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,040
But now, we are going to have a baby.

322
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,080
There is hope in life.

323
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,559
Then life has to go on.

324
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:51,160
Xiangyuan, do you know

325
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,280
what is the most terrible thing?

326
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,119
That is to keep looking  back

327
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,160
when moving forward.

328
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,799
OK, let's drop it.

329
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,879
Just let bygones be bygones.

330
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,759
Everything will get better.

331
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's sit here.

332
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,519
It's really tiring
after shopping for a whole day.

333
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,039
Fanlv, you are pregnant now.

334
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,439
Still going out with us?

335
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,760
Your husband didn't stop you?

336
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,720
Did he? He treasures you so much.

337
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
If Lin Xiangyuan blames us,

338
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,639
you have to speak for us.

339
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,279
Can he control me?

340
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,639
Why hasn't Shasha come yet?

341
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,439
She leaves us alone again?

342
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,919
Let me call her.

343
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,319
It's late. Let me send you back.

344
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,360
Let's go.

345
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,279
Wait a minute.

346
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,399
What happened?

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,159
Sands are in my eyes.

348
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,559
Look!

349
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:09,880
Check out who that is?

350
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,399
No way!

351
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,559
It is really him.

352
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:13,880
What are you looking at?

353
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,439
Nothing. The environment
is quite nice here.

354
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,639
Really?

355
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,279
Why didn't I notice?

356
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:44,120
It's pretty good, very affectionate.

357
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,240
Fanlv, still awake?

358
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,600
Aren't you the same?

359
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,159
Still be out there messing
around in the midnight.

360
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,480
Who is messing around?

361
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,480
A work meal and I was held back.

362
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,799
At this moment,

363
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,159
you're still trying to cheat?

364
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,720
Opening a room in a hotel
during the Spring Festival.

365
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,279
Not bad, huh?

366
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,159
You asked me to go home with you
so eagerly for the Spring Festival.

367
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,559
I thought how filial you are.

368
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,279
You are really good!

369
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,159
No, I didn't go home
during the Spring Festival

370
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,240
and opened a room in a hotel.

371
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,200
I can explain.

372
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,360
Explain what?

373
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,080
Stop pretending!

374
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,519
I saw it clearly this afternoon.

375
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,240
In broad daylight,

376
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,200
you were with a lady and
had very close physical touch.

377
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,240
I cannot imagine

378
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,159
how many shameful things
you have done in private.

379
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,760
You mean Li Mengnan?

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,840
Please speak with respect.

381
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,279
Angry now?

382
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,080
Are you serious to that home-wrecker?

383
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,519
Could you just stop it?

384
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,799
It's really a shame!

385
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,399
Dad, he did this to me.

386
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:55,880
We are done.

387
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,960
What did I do? That's my fellow.

388
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,760
You can embarrass me deliberately.

389
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
You can also pour dirty water on me.

390
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
But please don't insult my friend, OK?

391
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Your friend?

392
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,840
So affectionate.

393
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,919
Lin Xiangyuan, if you are a man,

394
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,519
stop taking advantages of both sides.

395
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:17,519
You can't have your cake and eat it.

396
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,760
Enough!

397
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,720
Does that sound good to you?

398
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:23,840
What happened?

399
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,240
Have you been unfaithful to her?

400
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,319
Dad, Li Mengnan came to Shanghai
for business.

401
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,919
As a fellow and a host,

402
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,080
I just accompanied her around.

403
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
Do you think I believe you?

404
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,200
That's right.
I don't need to explain at all.

405
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Because even if I explained,
you won't listen.

406
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,080
From the day we got married,

407
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,480
have you treated me well?

408
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,439
Have you ever regarded me
as your husband?

409
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,120
Jiang Fanlv,

410
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,639
don't you wish I had
some affairs outside,

411
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,919
so that you can directly

412
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,559
divorce with me?

413
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,159
Dad, I don't mind how Fanlv
is usually wayward,

414
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,120
and how she loses her temper.

415
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,639
I can try my best to bear all.

416
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,919
But she cannot just fabricate this

417
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,360
to force me to divorce.

418
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,439
Nor can she make fun of my friend.

419
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,399
My friend is innocent.

420
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,399
You have to be fair.

421
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,799
Fanlv,

422
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,919
Xiangyuan is not unreasonable.

423
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,080
How about you both calm down first?

424
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,039
Fanlv,

425
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,799
did you really misunderstand him?

426
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:14,448
(Eight Months Later)

427
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,760
Lei Yuzheng.

428
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,760
Come out and go through
procedures with me.

429
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,319
Congratulations, buddy.

430
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,960
Free again.

431
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,840
Yes, free again.

432
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,519
I've never expected

433
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,240
"freedom" can be

434
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,639
so luxurious like now.

435
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,319
Well, you don't want to leave?

436
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,200
To some extent, you are right.
Yes, kind of.

437
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,200
Suddenly free again.

438
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,519
In the rest of my life,

439
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,760
I will never forget this place.

440
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,799
No matter what,

441
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:14,600
this is just a place you stopped by.

442
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,919
You can take it as a suffering,

443
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,000
or a practice.

444
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,159
But no matter how you take it,

445
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,519
when the time comes, you have to leave.

446
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,279
Move forward.

447
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:48,639
Money Game.

448
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:56,480
Bye.

449
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,639
Take care.

450
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,399
Remember,

451
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,159
after you go outside that door,
don't look back.

452
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,880
Live a good life after going out.

453
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,159
When you have any difficulties,
just call me.

454
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,919
The door here

455
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
is always open.

456
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,919
But hope you'll never come back.

457
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,399
Thank you, Officer Liang.

458
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,679
You're welcome. This is my job.

459
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,600
Didn't you inform your family?

460
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:57,639
No, it's not a glorious thing.

461
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
I didn't tell them.

462
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,159
Let bygones be bygones.

463
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,319
Don't think too much.

464
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
There are still more days to come.

465
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,600
Here. Just go.

466
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
This place is a bit remote.

467
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,559
If you don't leave now,
you will miss the bus.

468
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,720
Bon voyage.

469
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,519
Goodbye.

470
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,896
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

471
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,880
Who is this?

472
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,360
Didn't recognize her?

473
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,120
Wanhua.

474
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,120
Wanhua.

475
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,319
Yes, it's her, Wanhua.

476
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,039
Yuzheng is not at home.

477
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,919
But where did Wanhua go?

478
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,559
She also went abroad.

479
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,080
She's worried about Yuzheng.

480
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,720
So, she went with him.

481
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,679
Go to the door to check

482
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,200
if they have come back.

483
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:19,240
There are so many things that
haven't been done abroad.

484
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,480
They will be back
after they finish them.

485
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,760
No, you have to go and check.

486
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,519
Maybe they're back now.

487
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,120
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

488
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
OK, then.

489
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,720
I will go to check.

490
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,760
Hurry up.

491
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,120
Stay here.

492
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,679
I'll be right back.

493
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:44,319
He's back. He's back.

494
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:17,919
Yuzheng,

495
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,439
you are back.

496
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,039
This is really magical.

497
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,679
Mr. Lei asked me to check the door

498
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,639
just at the right time,

499
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,240
neither too early nor too late.

500
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,559
If it is not the telepathy
between a father and a son,

501
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,840
what else it could be?

502
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:32,439
Kid, you're back!

503
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,720
Uncle Duan misses you so much!

504
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,639
Uncle Duan, where's my dad?

505
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,039
Mr. Lei!

506
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,760
Mr. Lei, check out who is back?

507
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,279
Yuzheng is back.

508
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:06,480
Dad,

509
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
I am back.

510
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,559
Dad.

511
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,039
You're back?

512
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,240
You finished all matters abroad?

513
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,799
It's all done, dad.

514
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:20,799
Mr. Lei.

515
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,880
Dad.

516
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,039
It's OK. It's so far away.

517
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,279
Are you hungry?

518
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,559
Yuzheng is hungry.
Start the meal, Duan.

519
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,919
OK, start the meal now.

520
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,360
Let's open a bottle of red wine.

521
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,559
Let's celebrate.

522
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,240
And Yuzheng's favorite, crystal shrimp.

523
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,679
I am going to prepare now.

524
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,000
Great.

525
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,319
About that matter,

526
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:00,840
although dad is willing to believe you,

527
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,159
ins and outs,

528
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,519
you have to make it clear as well.

529
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,880
You said that you went home
for the Spring Festival,

530
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,679
but it turned out that,

531
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,200
you were in a hotel room.

532
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,240
No wonder Fanlv doubted.

533
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,679
Dad, I was planning to.

534
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:28,240
I already drove to the airport.

535
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,319
My mom called and scolded me,

536
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,639
saying that I had to take my wife home,

537
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,240
or I couldn't go home.

538
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,159
I was also very embarrassed.

539
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,639
If I went back, how could I
explain to my mom?

540
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,639
If I stayed in Shanghai,
how could I face Fanlv?

541
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,840
I really had no good idea in the end.

542
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,319
So, I opened a room in a hotel

543
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,120
to calm myself down.

544
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,240
As for Li Mengnan,

545
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Jiang Fanlv was catching at shadows.

546
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,039
For this matter, I'm all to be blamed.

547
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,120
For the Spring Festival,

548
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,639
your mom wants a family reunion.

549
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,600
This is human nature.

550
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,360
But Fanlv

551
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,000
was spoiled since she was a kid.

552
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,760
She didn't want to go back with you,

553
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,439
and I could do nothing about it.

554
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,439
But we ignored your feelings,

555
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:38,960
and hurt you.

556
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,880
But when there is a problem,
we should solve it together.

557
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,600
Not like you and Fanlv.

558
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,840
You clamored to get a divorce,
whenever something happened.

559
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,360
This will only hurt your relationship.

560
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,439
Am I right?

561
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,639
Dad, I didn't demand a divorce.

562
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,039
I want to live a good life.

563
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,799
But Fanlv doesn't give me the chance.

564
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,600
I really can't do anything about it.

565
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,439
Don't worry.

566
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,039
Although Fanlv is wayward,

567
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,760
she is not bad in nature.

568
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,279
Find a chance to explain to her,

569
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,519
and she can figure it out naturally.

570
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,519
As for your mom,

571
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,200
when it gets warmer,

572
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,279
bring her to Shanghai.

573
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,840
She raised you up alone

574
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,039
and suffered a lot.

575
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,080
You and Fanlv should do your best
to take care of her.

576
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,639
As for Fanlv,

577
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,279
ask her to apologize to
your mother sincerely.

578
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,720
Xiangyuan, just do me a favor.

579
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:03,919
Dad,

580
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,799
I am sorry.

581
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,600
I'm the one who had you suffer.

582
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,399
I will take care of you from now on.

583
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,840
Why should you take care of me?

584
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,600
I am very well. You don't need to.

585
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,039
Work harder.

586
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Yutian is such a big company.
Don't you need to take care of it?

587
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
My son can tell jokes now.

588
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,080
You take care of me?
Am I a three-year-old kid?

589
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,840
Eat, eat.

590
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,480
Dad.

591
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,799
Come, let's wash feet.

592
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,000
Hot?

593
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,439
Dad,

594
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:30,639
I won't go anywhere anymore.

595
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,879
I'll stay at home with you.

596
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,879
When I was little,
you took care of me.

597
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,480
Now, I should take care of you.

598
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,760
What happened?

599
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,079
You are not my son. Who are you?

600
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:03,599
Dad, I am Yuzheng.

601
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,560
No, you're not Yuzheng.

602
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,560
You don't look like my son at all.

603
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,639
This is when I was a kid.

604
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,359
I'm grown up now

605
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,480
and look different from before.

606
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,359
No, you're not Yuzheng.

607
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:23,079
You must be a liar, a liar.

608
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
You are a liar, a liar.

609
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,639
Dad.

610
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:28,399
You said that, when I was young,

611
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,879
my nose looked exactly like yours.

612
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:32,839
You can touch and feel.

613
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,560
Just touch it.

614
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,839
There are so many noses
that look similar.

615
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,520
Dad.

616
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,159
Drive away the liar.

617
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,480
Mr. Lei.

618
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,520
What's wrong, Yuzheng?

619
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,679
Uncle Duan,

620
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,720
my dad suddenly doesn't recognize me.

621
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,879
Mr. Lei, why are you confused?

622
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,560
You look forward to seeing your son
every day.

623
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,520
Yuzheng is back now.

624
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,679
He is standing in front of you.

625
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,599
Why can't you recognize him?

626
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,919
Nonsense.

627
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:02,879
He is not Yuzheng.

628
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,679
How come…

629
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240
Definitely not. He is a liar.

630
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,599
You drive him away.

631
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,800
Dad,

632
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,040
I know I did something wrong.

633
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:15,599
I'm the one who had you suffer.
I'm the one who destroyed Yutian.

634
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,359
You can beat me and scold me,
and I won't have any complaints.

635
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,280
But, please don't disown me.

636
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,839
Lei…

637
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:58,119
Lei Yuzheng?

638
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,439
Great, it's really you.

639
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,560
You are back. You are finally back.

640
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,079
What happened to you?

641
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,200
Did you see your dad?

642
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,040
Did

643
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,159
your dad kick you out?

644
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,720
Actually, you were not the first one
who was kicked out.

645
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,079
He kicked out many people.

646
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,480
Qunfei, Uncle Duan,

647
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,599
and me.

648
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,040
I'm his son.

649
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,280
You can't blame him.

650
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,079
He is clear sometimes.

651
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,960
Sometimes, he doesn't remember anything.

652
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,119
This is caused by his illness.

653
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:28,439
Please stand up.
It's quite cold outside.

654
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,480
I can't go inside now.

655
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,040
You neither.

656
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,919
Maybe when he sees you back,
he will be happy and…

657
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,159
Uncle Duan is there. That is enough.

658
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,359
Why?

659
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,560
I don't want to irritate him.

660
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,280
Xiaosu,

661
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,919
thank you for coming
to my house every day

662
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,960
to take care of my dad
during this period.

663
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,000
But I'm back now.

664
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,240
I think I have the ability to
take care of him by myself.

665
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,599
Well…

666
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,119
Do you understand?

667
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,119
Lei Yuzheng!

668
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,280
Lei Yuzheng!

669
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,119
