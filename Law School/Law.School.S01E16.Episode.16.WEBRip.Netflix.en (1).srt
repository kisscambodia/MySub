1
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,031
តើមេធាវីរបស់អ្នកនឹងមកដល់ទីនេះនៅពេលណា?

2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,579
ហៅជិនហីយ៉ុង។

3
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,373
ហេតុអ្វី? គាត់ជាព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាមិនមែនជាមេធាវីទេ។

4
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,625
គ្រាន់តែហៅគាត់។

5
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,963
ហៅគាត់ដោយខ្លួនឯង។

6
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,632
ជាមួយទូរស័ព្ទដុត។

7
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,473
អាយអូតិចបំផុត

8
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,725
ប៉ុន្តែទាំងនេះសុទ្ធតែជាភស្តុតាងធម្មតា។

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,976
មិនមានកាំភ្លើងជក់ទេ។

10
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,689
រឿងដែលល្អបំផុតគឺការចាប់ Ko ដែលញុះញង់ឱ្យរៀបចំសេចក្តីអត្ថាធិប្បាយ។

11
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,816
ប៉ុន្តែ​ធ្វើ​យ៉ាងម៉េច?

12
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,693
មានវិធីមួយ។

13
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,405
Erica Shin ។

14
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,785
Erica Shin ។

15
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,871
មែនហើយខ្ញុំបាននិយាយទៅកាន់ព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាលោកយ៉ាងតាមទូរស័ព្ទ។

16
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,790
ឥឡូវនេះគាត់ជាសាស្រ្តាចារ្យ។

17
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,209
តើអ្នកប្រាកដទេ?

18
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,170
បាទខ្ញុំត្រូវតែធ្វើបែបនេះ។ - ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនអាចធ្វើវាបាន ...

19
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,089
ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ធ្វើ​វា។

20
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,340
អ្នកអាចរៀនបាន។

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,429
ដីកាស្វែងរកនិងចាប់ខ្លួន?

22
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,723
តើអ្នកគិតថាការឡើងខ្ពស់នឹងអនុម័តវាទេ?

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,267
មិនដែល

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,354
ច្បាប់នីតិវិធីព្រហ្មទណ្ឌចែងថាព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាណាមួយអាចស្នើសុំដីកាចាប់ខ្លួន។

25
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,772
នោះមិនមែនជាបញ្ហាទេនៅទីនេះ។

26
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,441
យើងបានចោទប្រកាន់ព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាជិនដែលមិនធ្លាប់មានពីមុនមក។

27
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,486
អ្នកបានគាំទ្រជាមួយគាត់បន្ទាប់ពីដាក់ខ្ញុំឆ្លងកាត់បញ្ហាទាំងអស់។

28
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,283
Brief the media on Ko's charges when the warrant is issued.

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,535
He's planning to run for president,

30
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,705
so the public has the right to know about his corruption allegations.

31
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,708
Have you completely lost your mind?

32
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,084
All eyes are on me right now

33
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
because I filed charges against a prosecutor

34
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,255
for leaking info about a suspected crime.

35
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,840
And you want me to do just that?

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,717
The police will handle the briefing.

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,802
What are you thinking?

38
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,724
Assemblyman Ko will attack you for publicizing the allegations.

39
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,975
No, he won't.

40
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,730
He's the one who has proposed the bill to abolish that very law.

41
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,403
We should show the corrupt politicians like Ko Hyeong-su

42
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,989
that Article 126 of the Criminal Code

43
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,908
does not exist to shield them.

44
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,493
So it all depends on the warrant.

45
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,205
People like Ko Hyeong-su may have allies, but they also have many enemies.

46
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,373
That's true.

47
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,418
ខ្ញុំបាន heard ចៅក្រម Kang Seong-man ដែលគ្រប់គ្រងរាល់ដីកាទាំងអស់

48
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,128
គឺជាបុរសដែលមានសេចក្តីស្មោះត្រង់។

49
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,505
ជាក់ស្តែងមនុស្សគ្រប់រូបនៅក្នុងគ្រួសាររបស់គាត់គឺជាចៅក្រម។

50
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,759
កងស៊ុង - បុរស? Kang Ju-man …

51
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,262
- ភស្តុតាង។ Kang Ju-man? - ខ្ញុំបានឃើញគាត់នៅក្នុងរូបថតគ្រួសាររបស់គាត់។

52
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,653
សួស្តី?

53
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,572
តើអ្នកនៅលើយន្តហោះទេ?

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,076
អ្វី?

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,495
កាហ្វេខេអេហ្វរីធីអាស៊ី

56
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,664
Ko Hyeong-su មិនទុកចិត្តនរណាម្នាក់ងាយទេ។

57
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,458
ស្ងប់ស្ងាត់បន្តិច A ដូច្នេះនាងនឹងមិនលះបង់វាទេ។

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,460
ឈប់អង្រួនប្អូនស្រីខ្ញុំនៅជុំវិញ។

59
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,296
សូមឱ្យនាងផ្តោតលើការសិក្សានិងបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សារបស់នាង។

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,216
សូមឱ្យនាងផ្តោតលើការសិក្សារបស់នាង។ សូមឱ្យនាងផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍។

61
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,973
ត្រូវហើយយើងក៏នៅទីនេះដែរ។

62
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,021
សម្រាប់ការជួល

63
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,860
MACRO RECORDER

64
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,034
KO HYEONG-SU

65
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,786
យើងគួរតែពិចារណាព័ត៌មានក្លែងក្លាយ…

66
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,954
កំណត់ត្រាម៉ាក់អររ៉ូ

67
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,581
…ជាផ្នែកមួយនៃការនិយាយដោយសេរីរបស់យើង។

68
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,209
កាងដានអ្នកក្លាយជាអ្នកជោគជ័យដូចអេរីកាស៊ីន

69
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,004
អរគុណខ្ញុំទាំងអស់មែនទេ?

70
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,805
ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថា Yang Jong-hoon ចងចាំរឿងនោះ។

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,391
ខ្ញុំនឹងចាំរឿងនោះ។

72
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,559
KO HYEONG-SU

73
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,019
អេសអេសប៊ីឡៃយ៉ាយកូហ៊ុយឡុង - ស៊ូ

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,355
សិទ្ធិទាំងអស់ឥឡូវនេះ។ ខ្ញុំជា Park Geun-tae ជាមេធាវី។

75
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,899
អ្នក​ស្គាល់​ខ្ញុំ។ ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះផាកគឿន - ថេ។

76
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,359
ហៅចូល

77
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,571
ការហៅចូល

78
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,241
ហេលឡូ? - ចាងរកឃើញ?

79
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,160
KO HYEONG-SU

80
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,162
កាងដានអ្នក។

81
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,456
អ្នកនឹងត្រូវចំណាយសម្រាប់ការនេះ!

82
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,707
ត្រូវ។

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,044
ឧបសម្ព័ន្ធរបស់នាងកាងដុនផ្ទុះឡើងដូច្នេះនាងមិនដែលឡើងលើយន្តហោះឡើយ។

84
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:37,920
អ្វី?

85
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,813
កណ្តុរអ្នក…

86
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,690
ហ៊ានអ្នកយ៉ាងម៉េច។

87
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,110
ម៉េចហ៊ានបោកខ្ញុំ!

88
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,488
កុំបាត់បង់កំហឹងរបស់អ្នក។

89
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,031
នេះគ្រាន់តែជាការចាប់ផ្តើមប៉ុណ្ណោះ។

90
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,826
ហ្គូសនេះមិនស្រួលទេ។

91
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,664
ការជូនដំណឹង

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,792
តើ​នេះ​ជា​អ្វី?

93
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,085
បានបង្កើតបច្ចេកវិទ្យាពិសេស

94
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,920
រចនារបស់អេលីដាស៊ីនត្រូវបានគេបោះបង់ចោល

95
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,672
នាងខកខានការហោះហើររបស់នាង? បន្ទាប់មកតើ Erica Shin ជាអ្នកណាដែលយើងបានឃើញ?

96
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,009
- ចាសថា Sol? - តើអ្វីទៅ?

97
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,513
អ្នកមានន័យថានាងក្លែងខ្លួនជា Erica Shin និង…

98
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,848
គ្មានផ្លូវទេ។ នាងបញ្ឆោតយើងទាំងអស់គ្នា?

99
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,433
ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងទេ។

100
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,893
អ្នកផងដែរមែនទេ?

101
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,481
- ប្រសិនបើ Ko Hyeong-su មិនជឿនាង? - ខ្ញុំប្រាកដថាគាត់បានធ្វើ។

102
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,607
នាងថែមទាំងបញ្ឆោតយើងទៀតផង។

103
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,776
អ្នកមិនដឹងទេមែនទេ?

104
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,822
ខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភថា Weasel នឹងចាប់បានដូច្នេះខ្ញុំត្រូវធ្វើតេស្តសាកល្បង។

105
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,824
វាពិតជារំជើបរំជួលខ្លាំងណាស់។

106
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,619
មិនមានរទេះនៅទីនេះទេដោយសារតែការតវ៉ា។ សូមដើរបន្តិច។

107
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,537
ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ទៅ។

108
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,579
សាស្រ្តាចារ្យ។

109
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,039
ខ្ញុំឃ្លានណាស់។

110
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,167
សាស្រ្តាចារ្យ!

111
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,254
ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើបានល្អអ្នកដឹងទេ។

112
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,923
តើយើងអាចចាប់យកខាំដើម្បីបរិភោគបានទេ?

113
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,009
ខ្ញុំបានប្រាប់អ្នកថាខ្ញុំមិនដែលបរិភោគជាមួយសិស្សរបស់ខ្ញុំទេ។

114
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:08,970
ខ្ញុំគឺជាកងដាន។

115
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,859
លោកសុនឆុងអ៊ឹមសុឃុន

116
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,946
ស្វែងរកនិងរឹបអូស?

117
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,409
តើអ្នកបានប្រាប់ព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាលី - តើព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាទាំងអស់មិនដូចអ្នកទេ។

118
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,078
តើអ្នកកំពុងតែព្យាយាមធ្វើឱ្យលោកលីត្រូវបានបណ្តេញចេញឬ?

119
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,581
តើអ្នកអាចព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីគាត់ឥឡូវនេះទេ?

120
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,168
ខ្ញុំបាន heard ថាលេខរបស់អ្នកត្រូវបានរកឃើញនៅលើទូរស័ព្ទដែលពួកគេបានរឹបអូស។

121
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,630
សូមសហការជាមួយការស៊ើបអង្កេត។ ខ្ញុំកំពុងញ៉ាំឥឡូវ។ ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ទៅ។

122
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,180
តើខ្ញុំអាចញ៉ាំដោយគ្មានបញ្ហានេះបានទេ?

123
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,646
ចង់លឺអំពីជេជាងង៉ាំយ៉ុនល្អបំផុតដែលខ្ញុំធ្លាប់មានទេ?

124
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,193
jjajangmyeon ខ្ញុំមាននៅក្នុងការិយាល័យរបស់អ្នកនៅពេលដែលអ្នកជាព្រះរាជអាជ្ញា។

125
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,820
ហ្គូសរបស់ខ្ញុំវាល្អណាស់។

126
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,365
ខ្ញុំមិនជឿថាខ្ញុំឃ្លានបន្ទាប់ពីបង្កបញ្ហាបែបនេះ។

127
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,453
ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែនិយាយថាចំណែកនៅទីនេះគឺតូចណាស់។

128
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,081
ប្រហែលជាខ្ញុំគួរតែបញ្ជាទិញទំហំ jumbo ។

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,126
ប្រសិនបើអ្នកបានធ្វើរួចសូមបន្តទៅមុខទៀត។

130
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,552
អ្នកដឹងទេច្បាប់ ...

131
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,390
ច្បាប់ដែលខ្ញុំកំពុងសិក្សាជាមួយអ្នក។

132
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,189
វានឹងដាក់ទណ្ឌកម្ម Ko Hyeong-su ចំពោះអ្វីដែលគាត់បានធ្វើមែនទេ?

133
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,618
តើអ្នកប្រាប់ខ្ញុំឱ្យបំផ្លាញភស្តុតាង?

134
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,041
មិនចាំបាច់សរសេរអក្ខរាវិរុទ្ធទេ។

135
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:08,589
វាគ្រាន់តែថាគ្មាននរណាម្នាក់អាចទាញយើងចូលទៅក្នុងវាដោយមិនចាំបាច់ប្រើទូរស័ព្ទដុតទេ។

136
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,385
ធ្វើអ្វីក៏ដោយដើម្បីកម្ចាត់វា។

137
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,223
យើងនៅក្នុងទូកតែមួយតើអ្នកដឹងទេ?

138
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,644
ពេលនោះអ្នកមិនគួរទុកអ្វីពីខ្ញុំទេ។

139
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,563
ខ្ញុំបានប្រាប់អ្នក។ ខ្ញុំមិនដែលចង់និយាយកុហកអ្នកទេ។

140
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,899
ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែមិនបានប្រាប់អ្នកពីព្រោះអ្នកមិនចាំបាច់ដឹង។

141
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,403
នៅពេលខ្លះដូចនេះ

142
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,573
អ្នកត្រូវព្យួរហើយជួយខ្ញុំ។

143
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,743
នេះបើយោងតាមលោក Jin ។

144
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,496
គាត់បានជួបកូពេលគាត់ឈរជើងនៅក្នុងរដ្ឋសភា។

145
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,416
គាត់បានសារភាពថាបាននិយាយជាមួយកូតាមទូរស័ព្ទពីរបីដងថ្មីៗនេះ។

146
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,837
ប៉ុន្តែជាក់ស្តែងវាទាក់ទងនឹងការពិនិត្យឡើងវិញនៃរដ្ឋធម្មនុញ្ញ។

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,589
តើខ្ញុំនិយាយអ្វីទៅ?

148
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,592
- ពួកគេគ្រាន់តែនិយាយ? គ្មានសារអត្ថបទទេ? អត់ទេគ្រាន់តែហៅតាមទូរស័ព្ទ។

149
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,219
យើងបានធ្វើការវិភាគដើម្បីពិនិត្យមើលថាតើមានអ្វីត្រូវបានលុបចោលទេ

150
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,387
ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានសារជាអត្ថបទទេ។

151
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,223
ប៉ុន្តែបើយោងតាមកំណត់ត្រាទូរស័ព្ទ។

152
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,602
គាត់ប្រើតែទូរស័ព្ទដុតដើម្បីនិយាយជាមួយ Choi Jae-cheol និង Jin Hyeong-u ។

153
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,853
គាត់កំពុងលាក់អ្វីមួយ។

154
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,439
វាគ្រប់គ្រាន់ហើយក្នុងការធ្វើឱ្យព្រះរាជអាជ្ញាជិនមានអារម្មណ៍ថានៅជិតគ្នា។

155
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:11,527
ការដែលយើងចាប់បានសមាជិកសភា Ko បាននិយាយជាមួយ Choi Jae-cheol តាមទូរស័ព្ទ

156
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,030
អាចបង្ហាញពីការជ្រៀតជ្រែកចូលក្នុងអាជីវកម្ម

157
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,657
ប៉ុន្តែមិនមែនជាការញុះញង់ឱ្យប្រព្រឹត្តអំពើឃាតកម្មនោះទេ។

158
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,077
ដែលមានន័យថាយើងត្រូវការចម្លើយសារភាពរបស់គីឌាស៊ុងឬឆូជេជូល។

159
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,912
គីនឹងកំពប់ការពិតក្នុងពេលឆាប់ៗនេះ។

160
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,716
អ្នកគួរតែប្រាប់ប៉ូលីសនូវអ្វីដែលអ្នកបាន heard ពីគីឌូស៊ុង

161
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,468
មុនពេលដែលគាត់កំពប់ការពិត។

162
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,433
ហេតុអ្វីត្រូវប្រថុយ? អ្នកដឹងទេថាប៉ូលីសបានឆែកឆេរការិយាល័យរបស់កូ។

163
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,394
តុលាការនឹងមិនគាំទ្រទឡ្ហីករណ៍ការពារខ្លួនរបស់លោកគីទេ។

164
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,812
ហើយប្រសិនបើរឿងនោះកើតឡើង

165
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,149
គីប្រាកដជានឹងមិនបិទមាត់មិនអោយ Ko ឡើយ។ អ្នក​ដឹង​ទេ​ថា។

166
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,117
វាដល់ពេលដែលអ្នកលែងខ្សែពួររលួយ។

167
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
VOICE MEMO

168
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,768
ឃាតកម្ម?

169
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,228
អ្នកពិតជាមិនដឹងទេ។

170
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,232
អ្នកនឹងត្រូវបានគេរកឃើញថាស្លាប់នៅក្នុងបន្ទប់នោះប្រសិនបើអ្នកដឹងអំពីវា។

171
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,202
ពេលកំពុងស៊ើបអង្កេតការសង្ស័យថាសមាជិកសភា Ko Hyeong-su

172
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,830
បានបញ្ជាឱ្យលោក Ki Du-seong ធ្វើឃាតលោក Yang ដែលជាសាស្ត្រាចារ្យច្បាប់។

173
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,914
យើងបានឆ្មក់ចូលគេហទំព័រ

174
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,626
ដែលមតិយោបល់ត្រូវបានរៀបចំឡើងជាប្រព័ន្ធក្រោមបញ្ជារបស់គាត់

175
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,046
ដូច្នេះយើងទទួលបានដីកាចេញហើយស្វែងរកការិយាល័យរបស់គាត់។

176
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,424
ខ្ញុំមានការគោរពយ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះសាស្រ្តាចារ្យយ៉ាងយ៉ាងនិងសាស្ត្រាចារ្យគីម។

177
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,843
និយាយឱ្យចំទៅនិយាយពីការងារជាក្រុមល្អឥតខ្ចោះ។

178
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,845
សាស្រ្តាចារ្យគីមដោយចោទប្រកាន់ការពិតជាសាធារណៈ។

179
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,265
លោកយ៉ាងដោយផ្សព្វផ្សាយជាសាធារណៈនូវការចោទប្រកាន់នេះ។ ពួកគេទទួលបានគាត់ល្អ។

180
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,350
អីយ៉ាអ្នកណាដឹងថានេះជាផែនការរបស់គេ?

181
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,980
Yangcrates បានធ្វើបែបនេះដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាពួកគេនឹងធ្វើការស៊ើបអង្កេត Ko Hyeong-su ត្រឹមត្រូវ។

182
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,773
ត្រូវហើយមនុស្សត្រូវដឹង

183
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,693
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាបេក្ខជនប្រធានាធិបតីនាពេលអនាគតកំពុងត្រូវបានស៊ើបអង្កេត។

184
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,737
Ko Hyeong-su បានស្នើសុំវិក័យប័ត្រហើយលេងជាមួយយើង។

185
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,990
ខ្ញុំហ៊ានភ្នាល់ថាគាត់មិនបានឃើញការមកដល់នេះទេ។

186
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,825
គាត់បានជីកផ្នូររបស់គាត់។

187
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,535
កុំរំភើបពេក។

188
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,621
យើងមិនដឹងថានរណានឹងត្រូវបញ្ចុះនៅក្នុងផ្នូរដែលកូបានជីកទេ។

189
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,836
ទោះបីមានបញ្ហាដែលកូនប្រុសខ្ញុំបង្កក៏ដោយ

190
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,549
ការវាយតម្លៃរបស់ខ្ញុំបានកើនឡើងជាលំដាប់

191
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,052
ហើយមានអ្នកខ្លះប្តេជ្ញាថានឹងធ្វើអោយខ្ញុំចុះ។

192
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:47,057
វាពិតជាអកុសលណាស់ដែលប៉ូលីសនិងសាស្រ្តាចារ្យ Yang Jong-hoon

193
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,062
កំពុងអោយមនុស្សទាំងនោះប្រើវាដើម្បីទទួលបានអ្វីដែលគេចង់បាន។

194
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,523
ចាប់ផ្តើមការវាយបកតបវិញបន្ទាប់ពីធ្វើសេចក្តីរាយការណ៍។

195
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,567
គាត់នឹងមិនអង្គុយហើយធ្វើអ្វីទៀតឡើយ។

196
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,903
ប៉ុន្តែការពិតដែលតុលាការបានចេញដីកា

197
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,071
ត្រូវតែមានន័យថាមានភស្តុតាងជាច្រើន។

198
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,573
ភស្តុតាង, ជើងរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

199
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,784
ចៅក្រមដែលចេញដីកា។ ទាយមើលថាតើក្មួយស្រីរបស់គាត់ជានរណា។

200
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,703
សន្និសីទសារព័ត៌មានអេសអេសប៊ីឡៃយ៉ាយកូហ៊ុមហុង - ស៊ូ

201
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,621
នាង​គឺ…

202
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,540
និស្សិតម្នាក់របស់លោក Yang Jong-hoon ។

203
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,843
លិខិតស្នើសុំ

204
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,762
ដូច្នេះបន្ទាប់ពីអានលិខិតនេះ

205
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,972
អ្នកមានអារម្មណ៍ថារហែកចង់សួរពួកគេ

206
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,641
មិនដាក់ទណ្ឌកម្មគាត់?

207
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:34,146
គាត់បានសរសេររឿងនេះដោយឈាមរបស់គាត់ហើយបានសន្យានឹងខ្ញុំថាគាត់នឹងមិនធ្វើវាម្តងទៀតទេ។

208
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,105
លិខិតស្នើសុំ

209
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,234
ខ្ញុំគួរតែអត់ធ្មត់សូម្បីតែពេលដែលអ្នកមានអារម្មណ៍ភ័យ។

210
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,819
ខ្ញុំពិតជាសុំទោសដែលខ្ញុំបានខឹងហើយវាយអ្នក” ។

211
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,574
នេះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំរំពឹងចង់បានពីអ្នកដែលមានការសោកស្តាយពិតប្រាកដនោះទេ។

212
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,952
គាត់មិនគួរវាយអ្នកទេទោះបីមានបញ្ហាអ្វីក៏ដោយ។

213
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,247
ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមិនដែលមានអារម្មណ៍ភ័យទេ។

214
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,291
អ្នកបាននិយាយថាអ្វីដែលទទួលបាននៅលើសរសៃប្រសាទរបស់គាត់គឺជាការពិតដែលថា

215
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,169
អ្នករក្សាការងារដែលគាត់បានប្រាប់អ្នកអោយឈប់។

216
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,257
គាត់មិនចូលចិត្តហាងកាហ្វេនេះជារបស់បុរសម្នាក់ទេ

217
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,008
ដូច្នេះគាត់បានប្រាប់ខ្ញុំអោយឈប់។

218
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,637
ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំត្រូវការការងារ។

219
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,681
នោះមិនមែនជាកំហុសរបស់អ្នកទេគឺ Seong-hui ។

220
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,726
"ខ្ញុំនឹងមិនវាយអ្នកទៀតទេទោះបីអ្នកធ្វើអ្វីក៏ដោយ" ។

221
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,228
នេះគឺដូចជាគាត់និយាយថា

222
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:18,399
អ្នកពិតជាមានកំហុសប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសូមទោសដែលមិនបានយល់គ្រប់គ្រាន់។

223
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,902
យើងគួរតែប្រុងប្រយ័ត្នទាំងពីរ។

224
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,488
ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកគិតថាគាត់ពិតជាមានអារម្មណ៍មិនល្អនោះទេ។

225
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,323
ខ្ញុំគិតថាគាត់កំពុងនិយាយជាក់ស្តែង

226
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,035
គាត់នឹងនៅតែវាយអ្នកប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនផ្លាស់ប្តូរផ្លូវរបស់អ្នក។

227
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,328
ប៉ុន្តែ…

228
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,248
គាត់បានសរសេរវាដោយឈាមរបស់គាត់។

229
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,749
ខ្ញុំបកស្រាយថាជា ...

230
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,169
“ ឈាមនឹងត្រូវបង្ហូរប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនស្តាប់ខ្ញុំ។

231
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,548
ខ្ញុំនឹងបង្រៀនអ្នកនូវមេរៀនមួយ។ នេះមើលទៅដូចជាការគំរាមកំហែងដល់ខ្ញុំ។

232
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,635
បន្ទាប់មកខ្ញុំត្រូវធ្វើអ្វី?

233
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,190
សួងហួយអ្នកមិននៅម្នាក់ឯងទេ។

234
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,486

255
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,411
ការស្លាប់ដែលបណ្តាលមកពីការបោះបង់ចោល។

វីដេអូនោះទទួលបានការអត្ថាធិប្បាយយ៉ាងច្រើន។ តើអ្នកនៅតែចង់បង្ហោះ vlog មែនទេ?

299
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,133
អ្នកមិនអាចធ្វើជារដ្ឋអាជ្ញាបានទេប្រសិនបើអ្នកខ្សោយបញ្ញា។

300
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,927
តើអ្នកបានឃើញវីដេអូនៃវគ្គផ្តាច់ព្រ័ត្រទេ?

301
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,262
- តើអ្វីទៅ? - ខ្ញុំបានប្រាប់អ្នកឱ្យមើលវីដេអូទាំងអស់។

302
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,889
យល់ព្រម​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង។

303
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,017
យើងនឹងមើលវាឥឡូវនេះ។ តោះ​ទៅ។

304
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,018
ឆាប់​ឡើង។

305
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,562
- ហេ។ -បញ្ឈប់​វា។

306
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,442
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកតាំងចិត្តឈ្នះ?

307
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,320
ខ្ញុំចង់ទទួលបាននៅខាងល្អរបស់លោកប្រធានាធិបតី។

308
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,030
សុំទោសដែលធ្វើអោយអ្នកខកចិត្ត

309
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,991
ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេមិនដែលជ្រើសរើសអ្នកឈ្នះទាំងពីរពីសាលាតែមួយទេ

310
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,201
ក្នុងឆ្នាំមុន ៗ ។

311
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,911
យើងនឹងក្លាយជាមនុស្សដំបូងគេដែលធ្វើដូច្នោះ។

312
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,788
តោះកំណត់កំណត់ត្រា។

313
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,250
ខ្ញុំគិតថាវានឹងពិបាកដោយសារតែ Sol ។

314
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,377
ត្រូវហើយវាមិនងាយស្រួលទេ។

315
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,837
វាប្រាកដជាមិនងាយស្រួលទេ។

316
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,547
-តើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​និយាយ​អំពី​អ្វី? - តើអ្វីទៅ?

317
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,591
ខ្ញុំមិនទាន់បានធ្វើនៅឡើយទេប៉ុន្តែតើអ្នកអាចឆ្លងកាត់អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញទេ?

318
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,301
លើបុព្វហេតុនិងករណីទាំងអស់។

319
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,180
ខ្ញុំបានមើលវីដេអូនៃវគ្គផ្តាច់ព្រ័ត្រផងដែរ។ អ្នកខ្លះគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់។

320
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,265
ពួកគេពិតជាល្អណាស់។

321
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,019
វាមិនមែនជាការប្រយុទ្ធងាយស្រួលទេ

322
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,898
ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនចង់ you អ្នកនិយាយថាយើងបានបាត់បង់ដោយសារតែខ្ញុំដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាព។

323
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,026
វាពិតជាមិនងាយស្រួលទេក្នុងការបង្កើតកំណត់ត្រា។

324
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,656
Ko Hyeong-su

325
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,242
គាត់ទើបតែត្រូវបានចាប់ខ្លួន។

326
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,543
ខ្ញុំ​បាន​សួរ​អ្នក

327
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,755
ដើម្បីបំផ្លាញភស្តុតាង?

328
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,220
តើអ្នកអាចបញ្ឈប់ការថតបានមួយវិនាទីទេ?

329
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,855
ទូរស័ព្ទដែលឆេះនោះមិនមែនជាភស្ដុតាងតែមួយគត់ដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវបំផ្លាញចោលនោះទេ។

330
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,890
ខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាអ្នកនឹងទាបទេ។

331
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,476
Jin Hyeong-u …

332
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,853
ការសួររកឃាតកម្ម? នេះគឺជាវិធីដែលមិនមានខ្សែ។

333
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,812
"ក្រៅបន្ទាត់"?

334
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,856
អ្នកគឺជាមនុស្សម្នាក់ដែលត្រូវនិយាយ។

335
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,153
អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានធ្វើគឺរកឃើញចន្លោះប្រហោងដែលអាចអោយអ្នកដែលស្គាល់ច្បាប់ដឹងច្បាស់។

336
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,242
ជំនាញរបស់ខ្ញុំកំពុងងាកទៅរកវិបត្តិ

337
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,328
ចូលទៅក្នុងឱកាសមួយ។

338
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,040
តើ​អ្នក​គិតថា

339
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,127
ខ្ញុំនឹងដួលបែបនេះ?

340
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,132
ខ្ញុំបានដោះដៃរបស់ខ្ញុំចេញពីរឿងនេះ។

341
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,844
ខ្ញុំនឹងមើលថាតើអ្នកនឹងត្រូវចោទប្រកាន់

342
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,888
ជាអ្នកខាងក្រៅ។

343
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,030
នេះគឺជាកូនប្រុសរបស់ Lee Man-ho ។

344
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,826
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមានរូបថតនេះ?

345
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,623
ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាអ្នកណាទុកវានៅក្នុងការិយាល័យរបស់ខ្ញុំទេ។

346
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,669
អ្នកគួរតែទូរស័ព្ទទៅមេធាវីរបស់អ្នក។

347
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,962
សូម…

348
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,423
ការកាត់ទោសមិនមែនក្រុមមេធាវីការពារក្តីទេ!

00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,510
តើអ្នកកំពុងគិតអំពីពូរបស់អ្នកទេ?

469
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,193
ខ្ញុំនឹងធ្វើដូចគ្នា។

470
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,986
អត់អី​ទេ​អរគុណ​ហើយ។

471

472
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,826
ពិតឬ?

473

បន្ទាប់មកសូមមើលថាតើអ្នកល្អប៉ុណ្ណា។

474
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,248
The victim is now deceased and can't talk.

475
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,376
The child would be alive if she received treatment soon.

476
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,546
However, she was neglected all night despite having a high fever

477
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,880
and eventually died.

478
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,678
You're a defense attorney.

Neglecting a 4-year-old child

481
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,686
who was clearly exhibiting side effects of the flu shot…

482
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,274
It is a clear case of child abandonment.

Maintain emotional distance.

485
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,158
You're about to nod and say you empathize with everything.

486
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,952
No, cut it out.

487
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,370
Do you want to sit over here?

488
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,039
No, I wasn't empathizing with what you were saying.

PROSECUTION

490
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,336
The temperature wasn't too high when she checked before going to work.

491
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,048
The flu shot can cause mild symptoms, such as a slight fever.

492
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,638
I'm going to do a great job in this mock trial.

493
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,682
Okay, go on then.

494
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,893
I will. Just go back to your seat.

495
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,562
Jeez.

496
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,189
The prosecutor insists

497
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:44,027
that the defendant's abandonment of the victim resulted in her death.

498
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,155
But do you think that a mother, who willingly abandoned her child,

499
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,658
would choose the type 4 vaccine over type 3, which is free,

500
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,036
when she was struggling financially?

501
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,330
Good point.

503
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,832
Go back to your seat.

504
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,796
It's rare to die after getting the flu shot,

505
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,717
so even though the defendant was worried about her child…

506
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,302
What? That was good, wasn't it?

507
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,512
Yeah, I don't need to play the prosecutor.

508
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,806
Let's go over the main argument.

509
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,066
Contrary to the prosecutor's argument,

510
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,525
the defendant chose…

00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,235
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

512
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,035
Here is the summary of the argument.

513
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,621
First, the defendant never abandoned the child…

514
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,208
For this case to constitute as abandonment resulting in death,

515
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,210
the prosecutor must prove that the victim…

518
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,971
I know they rejected your request for special defense counsel,

519
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,013
but don't worry.

520
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,515
I'm working hard.

00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,769
Geun-tae, that twerp. He just wrapped up Prof. Yang's case.

522
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,897
I heard Prof. Yang told him to take this on.

523
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,107
What?

528
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,094
Please be seated.

529
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,934
I would like to sit here since I am the victim.

530
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,272
The prosecutor should take neither side and must represent the common good,

531
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,524
so we should sit separately.

532
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,155
I will sit here

533
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:57,535
and observe the defendant to see if he truly regrets his actions.

They'll think the same about us. Don't be intimidated.

-This will be a good experience for us. -Okay.

00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,486

549
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,012
Have you ever met Mr. Ko?

550
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,724
-I met Choi Jae-- -Yes or no?

551
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,144
No.

552
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,146
So you've never met him?

553
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,147
Correct, but--

554
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,234
Then why did you say that Mr. Ko put you up to it?

555
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,527
Because Choi Jae-cheol--

556
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,696
Mr. Choi said he never mentioned anything about Mr. Ko to you.

557
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,365
That bastard…

558
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,289
He said he'd get me out on parole

559
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,085
if I managed to quietly get rid of Yang.

560
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,838
But you…

561
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,133
You were my attorney. How could you do this?

562
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,885
How much cash did that scumbag offer you?

563
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,011
No further questions.

564
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,515
You came to see me because you knew he had ordered me to do it.

565
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,474
Be quiet.

566
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,769

569
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,817
This jerk is keeping his lips sealed because he now represents him.

570
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,112
Witness, you must not speak in this manner in the courtroom.

571
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,073
Stop using foul language. Please speak in a calm manner.

WITNESS

573
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,704
Mr. Ki Du-seong said

574
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,831
the defendant had ordered him

575
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:11,252
to murder Professor Yang Jong-hoon and Lee Man-ho through you.

576
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,587
Is that true?

577
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,005
No, that is not true.

578
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,092
I asked him to kill Lee Man-ho, that piece of human trash.

579
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,760
As for that man,

580
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,097
Ki said he wanted to teach him a lesson for putting him behind bars.

581
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,057
He did it of his own accord?

582
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,184
That's right.

583
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,895
And the comments?

584
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,481
When the bill for the Lee Man-ho Act passed,

585
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,401
I became a huge fan of Assemblyman Ko.

586
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,487
So I started a secret fan club and did it voluntarily.

587
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,450
Mr. Ko never incited you to manipulate the comments?

588
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,367
Correct.

589
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,120
Assemblyman Ko knew nothing about the job.

590
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,249
"The job"?

591
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,755
No further questions.

593
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,342

The "job" you mentioned.

597
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,145
Mr. Ko knew nothing about it?

598
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,816
Correct.

599
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,903
No further questions.

600
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,991
Your Honor.

601
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,454
I'd like to bring Erica Shin in as a witness

602
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,206
to verify his claim.

603
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,335
-What? -Erica Shin?

604
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,628
-What's going on? -Erica?

605
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,671
-What? -Who?

606
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,381
-What's going on? -My gosh.

607
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,803

It's time you let go of the rotten rope.

611
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,362
So you're Erica Shin?

612
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,447
Let's meet as soon as you arrive in Korea.

613
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,866
I don't want to be associated with you ever again.

614
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,038
Your sister and Yang Jong-hoon keep getting on my nerves.

615
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,125
You know what happens to those who try to mess with me.

616
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,544
I sure know all about the jobs.

617
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,255
Manipulating public opinion, the witch hunts.

618
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,507
I ran away because I couldn't stand it.

619
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,384
That's nothing.

620
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,929
I can do worse things if your sister keeps up her antics.

621
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,682
Has the job already begun?

622
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,561
If you want to put a stop to it, meet me as soon as you arrive.

623
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,150
When did this phone conversation take place?

624
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,529
I think it was after my sister revealed my letter to Mr. Yang

625
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,573
on the Internet.

626
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,493

627
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,873
First, please check whether she really is Erica Shin.

628
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,499
What do you mean?

629
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,543
Everyone in this courtroom is being fooled!

630
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,379
She is not Erica Shin.

631
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,091
She's Kang Sol, Erica Shin's twin sister!

632
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,009
-What? -What?

633
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,218

637
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,052
Mr. Ko said he could do "worse things" to me.

638
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,804
Could you ask him what he meant?

640
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,070

00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,615
They got a criminal case. Last year, they nearly won.

642
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,825
They're very good.

643
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,580
This is an announcement.

644
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,835
Dear participants of the mock trial competition, please find your courtrooms.

Let me repeat the announcement.

00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:33,848
Dear participants of the mock trial competition, please find your courtrooms.

00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,400
Hold on.

650
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,776
What the…

651
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,155
-Wait, hold on. -What the heck are you doing?

652
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,239
Please, let go…

653
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,075
What are you doing? Please stop.

654
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,622
I clearly warned you. No funny business.

655
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,874
That was a threat.

656
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,586
In any case, I no longer have a reason to be afraid.

657
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,130
I found James.

658
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:11,010
Thank goodness you called me right away, Prof. Kim. It would've been bad otherwise.

659
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,930
He's in the hospital at the moment.

660
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,017
You even solicited kidnapping and confinement.

661
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,977
All kinds of solicitation charges.

662
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,729
It's time you paid for what you did.

663
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,316
-Sir. -Let go of me!

664
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,486
Let go! Let go of me!

Let go, you bastards! Let go!

I can't believe this day is finally here.

DEAR PROSECUTOR YANG JONG-HOON

671
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,776
Did you come straight here? You should go home.

672
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,860
Prof. Yang.

673
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,071
Please say a few words.

674
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,365
Just a few words about the trial.

675
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,159
The court's decision will tell you everything.

676
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,869
Is it true you brought Ko to trial

677
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,288
because of the mastermind behind the whole thing?

678
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,414
"Mastermind"?

679
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,791
No, that is not true.

680
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,708
What?

681
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,336
The Yang Jong-hoon I know

682
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,130
would never let anyone use him for political purposes.

683
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,134
I'd like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize to him

684
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,681
for the false accusation caused by the prosecution's mistake.

685
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,059
There's a mastermind behind this whole thing.

686
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,519
-What? -Really?

687
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,853
-Who? -Who is it?

688
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,272
-Tell us! -Who is it?

689
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,523
-Tell us who it is! -Wait!

690
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,691
-Who is it? -Prof. Yang!

What do we do?

00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,949

But still…

699
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,834
State your main argument.

700
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,794
You have eight minutes.

701
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,258
Sure.

702
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,176
I will state our main argument.

703
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,723
First, the defendant did not abandon the victim.

704
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,434
This cannot constitute abandonment resulting in death

705
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,395
unless the defendant is guilty of abandoning the victim,

706
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,690
whom the defendant had a legal or contractual duty to protect.

707
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,443
Had she said no when she got called into work

708
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,361
because she was worried about her child,

709
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,531
she probably would've been let go.

710
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,617
The company was trying to downsize.

711
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,578
Knowing that, she had to say yes to support herself and her kid.

712
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,289
She had no choice.

713
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,335
-To emphasize that, Zumutbarkeit-- -The non-existence of Zumutbarkeit

714
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,462
can be used as a ground for excuse.

ZUMUTBARKEIT: THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPECTING A LAWFUL ACT

716
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,382
Why bring this up now?

717
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,260
Gosh, why didn't I think of this?

718
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,596
We should've included this in what we submitted.

719
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,807
Shouldn't we include it in our oral argument?

720
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,559
Don't you know the rules?

721
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,063
We'll get penalty points if we raise a new argument.

722
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,858
But we must defend the client. Just because of the penalty points--

723
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,693
This is a competition.

724
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,445
Penalty points mean we won't win.

725
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,739
You suggested we do this because of the award.

726
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,741
Right.

727
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,286
But we can't leave it out when we know--

728
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,540
But it's clearly against the rules, which will put us at a disadvantage.

729
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,753
But we may not get a good score if we're not putting the client first.

730
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,506
I think we should include it in our argument--

731
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,800
This is a mock trial, not a real one.

732
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,803
The purpose of mock trials is to help us in real ones.

733
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,514

based on the principle of Zumutbarkeit.

743
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,714
It means we can't hold someone

The defendant in this case is the sole breadwinner for her family.

748

She couldn't say no when she was forced to come into work

749
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,401
outside of her regular work hours because she needed to keep the job.

Just a moment.

751
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,322
This argument was not included in your preparatory documents.

752
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,701
That is correct.

753
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,955

00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,636
for handing over the bill to abolish the law to Ko Hyeong-su.

821
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,013
But thanks to it,

822
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,308
you could help the Bad FaMa client get acquitted.

823
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,560
Well, no more.

824
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,398
Why should I help Ko Hyeong-su who uses the law for his own gain?

825
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,733
Let's tackle this together.

826
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,736
If we manage to get it declared unconstitutional,

827
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,447
we'll leave our mark on the history of criminal law.

828
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,282
Let's get started now.

829
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,411
What? Start what?

830
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,455
Are you the mastermind behind Prof. Yang?

831
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,041
The mastermind behind Jong-hoon?

832
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,919
We do have similar figures.

833
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,494
PRETTY YE-SEUL: JI-HO'S TEAM WON! CONGRATULATIONS!

834
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,219
PUB

835
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,725
Good job.

836
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,152
-Congratulations! -Congratulations!

837
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,570
-Thanks! -Congratulations!

838
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,030
-Well done. -Way to go!

839
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,948
Winning is important,

840
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,785
but kudos to you for not betraying your conscience in court.

841
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,497
-Agreed. -She has such a refreshing outlook.

842
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,291
But you guys made it to the semifinals. You should've won.

843
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,168
You couldn't even participate in it.

844
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,212
I would've won had I participated in it.

845
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,421
Even Bok-gi won.

846
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,131
Why are you dragging me into this?

847
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,716
You learned everything from me.

848
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,885
The winners, tell us how you feel.

849
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,803
Yes, tell us.

850
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,262
-My gosh. -Way to go!

851
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,306
MOM

852
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,185
What's up?

853
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,271
Look at you. You got eliminated in the semifinals.

854
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,940
Because of your roommate--

855
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,108
I really didn't want to do it because of you,

856
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,027
but my roommate convinced me to do it.

857
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,613
And it's not her fault that we lost.

858
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,906
Sol did a good job.

859
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,367
So stop this, okay?

860
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,627
Bottoms up.

861
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,854
You said "Sol" did a good job. Is that me?

862
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,193
It is me?

863
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,782
My gosh, I'm so happy right now.

864
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,368
Can you say it again?

865
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,870
Call me "Sol."

866
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,246
-Cut it out. -Call me "sis."

867
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,498
Sis.

868
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,253
What are you doing here? I thought you'd be all sad.

869
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,255
I was sad that we didn't win.

870
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,757
But my roomie said I did well.

871
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,760
"Sol did a good job."

872
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,558
I wouldn't be this happy even if we won.

873
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,060
-You need to give me credit for it. -No.

874
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,520
You went overboard.

875
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,105
What are you talking about?

876
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,815
I think I did a pretty good job.

877
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,151
I must say, I'm jealous that they won.

878
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,028
We'll win next time.

879
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:35,295
All right! Let's do it!

880
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,048
Okay? Let's win!

881
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,884
Go, team!

882
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,852
"Every new time will give its law."

883
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,021
Maxim Gorky.

884
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,231
"Law is an ethical minimum."

885
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,566
Georg Jellinek.

886
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:01,655
"The law destroys those who do not fear it."

887
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,282
George Gordon Byron.

888
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,201
"We are not machines.

889
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,161
Abide by the Labor Standards Act."

890
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,080
Jeon Tae-il.

891
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,999
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

892
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,125
Hammurabi.

893
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,794
Doesn't count! You're out, Ji-ho.

894
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:16,795
Why?

895
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,298
Hammurabi, seriously? That's too easy.

896
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,092
What? This is not fair.

897
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,928
"Judge fairly…

898
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,390
and make sure no one suffers unjustly."

899
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,893
Seo…

900
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,855
Byung-ju.

901
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,560
1 YEAR LATER

902
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,062
The results of the constitutional review

903
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,733
requested by Head Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u

904
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,526
will be announced shortly.

905
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:26,031
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u requested the constitutional review,

906
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,117
arguing that Article 126 of the Criminal Code

907
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,579
infringes the freedom of speech and the public's right to know.

908
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,913
For the common good…

909
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,665
We'll finally find out the decision.

910
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:42,130
Even if it's declared constitutional and the trial has to resume,

911
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,090
I won't lose the trial--

912
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,842
But you lost the civil suit.

913
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,636
I went easy on you

914
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,015
to express my deepest condolences on the passing of your father.

915
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,224
This will be different.

916
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,559
It won't be any different.

917
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,895
Because I won't go easy on you.

918
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,568
Shouldn't you resent Cho Tae-yeong more than me?

919
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,616
Unlike you, he does not represent the common good.

920
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,912
Represent the common good…

921
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,455
Fine.

922
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:20,001
Then I shall do my duty and catch Cho Tae-yeong for you.

923
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,672
In return, you'll file a petition if the trial resumes. What do you say?

924
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,095
I'm giving you a chance to grab the golden rope.

925
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,096
"Golden rope"?

926
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,809
A bale of straw at the most.

927
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,818
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

928
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,778
A bale of straw?

929
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,243
That was cute.

930
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:07,173
Could you please make sure my face doesn't look too big?

931
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,219
Ready, go.

932
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,055
Our students go through the inquiries

933
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,599
that we receive here at the Legal Clinic Center

934
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,936
and assist the professor who is here as an advisor.

935
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,105
In addition to offering legal consultations…

936
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,816
I'm so glad to hear that your surgery went well, ma'am.

937
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,609
It was all because of money.

938
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,946
I really wanted that jerk to pay for what he did, but I couldn't.

939
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,953
Gosh, it's tiring to be the chief of the Legal Clinic.

940
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,998
Oh, dear. That interview was exhausting.

941
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,666
Don't cry.

942
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:45,670
My professor will make your husband fear the law.

943
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:51,676
What? Me? If she's submitted a request not to punish him, it's game over.

944
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,428
We can still get him punished.

945
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,140
For child abuse, not assault.

946
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,017
But he didn't hit the kid.

947
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,852
-Right, he didn't. -So how?

948
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,730
But the kid saw his dad hit his mom.

949
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,648
He's seen it many times, in fact.

950
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,402
It left a deep emotional scar on the kid.

951
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,905
And here's a precedent

952
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,990
where the perpetrator of such emotional abuse

953
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,408
was convicted of child abuse.

954
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,496
Now, I just want you to pass the bar exam on the first try.

955
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,207
I should go study now.

956
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,334
Bye.

957
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,463
My, she's good.

958
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,468
You know carbs make you sleepy.

959
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,847
You're in your 3L year. Cut down on sleep before the bar exam.

960
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,308
Goodness. She's already sleep-deprived.

961
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,476
What if she fails?

962
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,687
-That will be so embarrassing-- -I won't fail the bar.

963
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,147
I suffer from insomnia.

964
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,400
Please prescribe some sleeping pills.

965
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:53,905
I think it'd be better to help you beat insomnia without sleeping pills.

966
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,908
I noticed something important while observing your conversation

967
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,993
and the way you interact with each other.

968
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:04,958
Ma'am, you still want to decide what your daughter should eat.

969
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,837
And, Sol, instead of just saying you want to eat bread,

970
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,466
you said, "I won't fail the bar exam, so I can eat the bread."

971
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,179
It tells me you can't directly express your needs and wants.

972
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:23,351
It reminds me of the way little kids interact with their parents.

973
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,353
I think all three of you

974
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,565
should try to become more mature in your parent-child relationship

975
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:32,235
so you can be happier and freer.

976
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,576
Joon-hwi.

977
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,203
-Where are you going? -I need to wind down.

978
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,588
You wanted to wind down.

979
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,009
Yeah, while watching the trial.

980
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,010
ADMIN OFFICE

981
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,054
Right.

982
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,349
I've been too busy studying that I didn't have time to come here.

983
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,269
Well, I should wind down a little too.

984
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,026
Your Honor, please have mercy on me.

985
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,903
If my house goes to auction,

986
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,406
my grandson and I

987
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,993
will become homeless.

988
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,164
Are you willing to settle the case?

989
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,915
The defendant seems to be in a bind.

990
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,876
No, Your Honor.

991
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,294
Please announce the decision.

992
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,589
Please have mercy on me.

993
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,675
I'll die soon anyway,

994
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,846
but my poor grandson…

995
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,768
We can't help you if you just keep asking for mercy.

996
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,478
Defendant.

997
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,647
Instead of struggling alone,

998
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,650
I suggest you ask an attorney to go through the documents.

999
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,860
Your Honor.

1000
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,199
I think he needs some time to regain his composure.

1001
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,533
Can we take a recess?

1002
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,124
Seun Savings, the plaintiff, loaned 20 million won to your son,

1003
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,293
and you stood surety for him.

1004
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:13,920
Yes.

1005
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:18,216
Seun Savings loaned him the money six years ago.

1006
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,719
He died in a car accident five years and four months ago

1007
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,262
while just paying the interest.

1008
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,848
And the interest grew larger than the principal,

1009
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,184
so the total amount is now over 50 million won.

1010
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,435
Right.

1011
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,148
The plaintiff is asking for the money back after keeping quiet all these years.

1012
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,528
Begging the judge in tears won't solve the problem.

1013
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,280
When the trial resumes,

1014
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,158
just say this one thing to the judge.

1015
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,493
Pardon me?

1016
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,994
Please repeat after me.

1017
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,372
The statute of limitations…

1018
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,500
The statute of limitations…

1019
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,420
on the loan has already expired.

1020
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:59,424
on the loan has already expired.

1021
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,386
I have the draft ready.

1022
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,223
This loan is considered commercial debt.

1023
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:10,643
So, as of November 26th, 2021, the date the plaintiff filed the complaint,

1024
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,480
the statute of limitations of five years on this loan

1025
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,357
has already expired.

1026
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,152
Ergo, the plaintiff's request should be denied.

1027
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,864
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

1028
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,617
Why are you here?

1029
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,330
Was that a gift?

1030
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:36,461
Are you still going on about the lot I gave to Byung-ju?

1031
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:41,382
You want to hear me say that it was a bribe?

1032
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,679
What will change if I admit to it now?

1033
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,224
Prohibition against double jeopardy, you know?

1034
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,773
It'll only make you beat yourself up more for failing to solve it.

1035
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,143
It was a bribe, wasn't it?

1036
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,065
I showed everyone that…

1037
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,777
the law is not just.

1038
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,490
That I was wrong.

1039
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,920
What will change if I admit to it now?

1040
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,676
It'll only make you beat yourself up more for failing to solve it.

1041
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,014
Because I have students

1042
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,517
who learn from it…

1043
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,577
I'm Yang Jong-hoon, your criminal law professor.

1044
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:22,919
A FEW YEARS LATER

1045
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:30,092
KANG SOL ATTORNEY AT LAW

1046
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,935
Just bring these documents next time,

1047
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,020
and I'll go over them for you.

1048
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,688
LAW OFFICE KANG & PARK

1049
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,233
I'm sorry. Something's come up.

1050
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,029
As Mr. Park helped you originally, he'll do the rest for you.

1051
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,157
Mr. Park, can you take care of the rest?

1052
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,076
Sure.

1053
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,959
How can I help you…

1054
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,884
PROSECUTOR HAN JOON-HWI

1055
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,787
The law is imperfect justice.

1056
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,252
But when you teach law, the law must be perfect.

1057
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,220
And when you study law, it must be synonymous with justice.

1058
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,768
Because unjust law is the most cruel violence.

1059
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,135
