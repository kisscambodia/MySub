AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

3
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,450
The entire trial process
has come to an end.

4
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:25,455
Lastly, we have
one very important final step.

5
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,500
It's a process called
reaching the verdict.

6
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:30,919

DELIBERATION: JURY'S DISCUSSION
VERDICT: JURY'S FINAL DECISION

8
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:37,551
A question from Juror No. 4.

9
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:41,680
"What does it mean to have this proven
beyond a reasonable doubt?"

10
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:47,102
I'm not sure how little
of reasonable doubt we can work with.

11
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:50,063
Please explain this in a simpler way
for us to understand.

12
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,524
Okay, here's the thing.

13
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:58,363
If the prosecutor brought enough,
if not perfect, proof,

14
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:02,409
and it is not reasonable to suspect
that the defendant may be innocent,

15
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,494
you should decide on a verdict of guilty.

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,539
However, when you find her guilty,

17
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:11,376
if you cannot clearly conclude her guilt
on common sense,

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,171
it means there are reasonable doubts left

19
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:16,506
on ruling the defendant guilty
for her crime.

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,053
Which means the prosecutor's presentation
was not enough to prove her guilt.

21
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:24,389
So, in that case,
you must find her innocent.

22
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:26,975
Do you understand?

23
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:29,186
JUROR

25
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:45,619
Is it possible for you to explain this
in an easier way?

28
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:03,011
Now, please look at this screen.

29
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,057
Here are 50 puzzle pieces.

30
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:10,143
Let's put the puzzle pieces together.

31
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,274
What could this be?

32
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:20,737
I put some puzzle pieces together,

33
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:25,867
but you'd think these gray puzzle pieces
are still in pieces.

34
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,077
You're still doubtful.

35
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,247
There is room for reasonable doubt.

36
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,916
Let's put a few more together.

37
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:38,505
Well, that long droopy thing in the front

38
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:42,467
kind of looks like an elephant trunk.

39
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,344
But it seems too early to conclude.

40
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:45,971
It still seems doubtful.

41
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,724
There is still room for reasonable doubt.

42
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,810
Let's put together a few more.

43
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:57,607
Now, what do you think?

44
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:02,112
Do you have any doubt
that this is a picture of an elephant?

45
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,698
No, right?

46
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:09,202
In that case, there's no reason
to put the rest of the pieces together.

47
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:12,956
This is proof beyond reasonable doubt.

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,308
You. Tell me.

53
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,101
Tell me!

54
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,604
Why did he make you do this?

55
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:37,147
I have no idea.

56
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,608
I just do as I'm told.

57
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:45,530
Open it.

58
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,950
You want me to kill you?

59
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:53,705
It's the same person.

60
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,499
What is this?

61
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:06,259

62
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,889
What? What's with this?

63
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:22,943
In the end,

64
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,905
did I end up falling into your trap?

65
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,541
You can't risk your life to set up a trap

66
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:41,253
just to catch the real culprit!

67
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:43,255
How did you lose your anklet?

68
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,215
My gosh.

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,386
Don't you care about your death?
This is all you want to know?

70
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,098
MILL

71
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:55,141
-You go check on Byeol.
-Okay.

72
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:56,768
Darn it.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,042
When I gave you

74
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:23,461
my blood,

75
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,800
I never imagined I'd see a day like this.

76
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,511
Okay, now. Where should I inject this?

77
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:35,056
-You should've left me to die then.
-Exactly. Right?

78
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,518
I never imagined I'd get caught in a trap.

79
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:43,606
I thought I should do it for you
as an insurance plan. Darn it, man.

80
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:47,193
It'll happen in a flash
if I inject it into your vein.

81
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:50,071
I'll need your cooperation.

82
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:51,698
This looks good.

83
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:55,827
Why did you kill him?

84
00:05:57,203 --> 00:06:00,832
He helped you crawl out of prison
instead of rotting there forever.

85
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:02,542
There was no need to kill him.

86
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:05,462
You're right.

87
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:08,882
Why did I care

88
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,551
so much about my darned son?

89
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,721
My gosh, man.

90
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,265
Stop making me talk, okay?

91
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,151
If you inject it there,
you can't cover it up as suicide,

92
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:31,821
saying I killed myself because
I was scared that I'd be found guilty.

93
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,324
I'm very bad with my left hand.

94
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:38,912
That's insane.

95
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,999
I haven't thought it out that much.

96
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,044
Okay. That's a very good idea.

97
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,015
Yes, what?

98
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,184
What do you think? I'm home.

99
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,852
He's not home!

100
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:06,940
That jerk.

101
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,153
You!

102
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,201
Darn it.

103
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,474
You.

104
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:43,226
I'll kill you.

105
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,853
Gosh.

106
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:45,812
Damn it.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

108
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:53,820
It's taking a while.

109
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:57,449
It seems like Juror no. 2
will take the lead in the decision.

110
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,536
It won't be acknowledged as self-defense.

111
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,498
You didn't bribe them, did you?

112
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,502
As if it was not enough to dig up
Ko's back.

113
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:12,839
My principle is to play by the rules

114
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:15,842
no matter how harsh
we tear each other apart in court.

115
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,014

JURY'S DELIBERATION

117
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,772
In my opinion,
I don't see a need to drag this out.

118
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:31,065
Why are we beating around the bush?

119
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,611
Let's not get too self-conscious
about what others think

120
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:36,946
and share our opinions to reach a verdict.

121
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,243
No. 4 lady.

122
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:45,121
If you're going to sleep, go home.

123
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,122
My gosh.

124
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,542
I would've left if I could have.

125
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:51,795
They told me to shut up and stay

126
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,631
until you're done
even if I'm an alternate.

127
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:55,715
What can I do?

128
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,967
Then stop snoring, will you?

129
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,135
You're interrupting us.

130
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:04,265
You're dragging this out
yet you can't seem to reach a conclusion.

131
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,642
Isn't it obvious?

132
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,644
I say it's self-defense.

133
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,230
Do you think it's easy
to call something self-defense?

134
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:13,399
-Were you out while the prosecutor talked?
-My gosh.

135
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:15,276
If we accept her case as self-defense,

136
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,570
everyone will claim that
and assault cases--

137
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:20,949
What the heck are you saying?
Didn't you hear what my daughter-- I mean…

138
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,117
What that girl who's her age said?

139
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,577
I have a question.

140
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:28,873
You may not ask anything that can hinder
the fairness of the trial. Keep it short.

141
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,208
BEFORE THE DELIBERATION

142
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:37,715
The prosecutor said self-defense can be
used as a means of pardon for criminals.

143
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,636
But is it right to consider defense
against injustice,

144
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,429
meaning anything illegal, as a crime?

145
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,683
If there are an assailant
who beat up an elderly man

146
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,477
and someone who assaulted him
while trying to stop him,

147
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,563
should they both be considered criminals?

148
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,732
Then who would ever try to save
an elderly man from an attack?

149
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,320
Ms. Jeon Ye-seul is sitting there
as a defendant because she tried to stop

150
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:01,155
the distribution of her spy cam video.

151
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:05,159
All she did was try to defend herself
from an awful crime.

152
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:06,953
If that's considered a crime,

153
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:10,331
then should we just let someone
violate our rights?

154
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:13,626
Goodness, she sounded like a smart girl.
I wonder who her parents are…

00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,478

180
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,528
She offered me as much as I wanted
to quit the study group and tutor you.

181
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,198
I'm not even her son,

182
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:09,450
yet your tiger mom
made me feel suffocated.

183
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,122
-And?
-I didn't want to tutor you,

184
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,374
but wanted to help you breathe.

185
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:19,001
Is that why you asked me
to join the group?

186
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:24,966
As I studied with you,
I knew you were born with that legal mind.

187
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,009
If I'd been the school,

188
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:30,346
I would've accepted you
even without that paper.

189
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,932
-What are you--
-Trying to ask

190
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:37,562
is if you don't feel guilty.

191
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:43,776
Not everyone speaks up
just because they feel guilty.

192
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,779
But you should.

193
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:51,075
Admit to what you did
and ask for the best.

194
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,202
From my experience,

195
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:56,080
you're someone who could face it.

196
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:17,852
Are you okay?

197
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,812
How do you feel?

198
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:22,356
I heard your head clears up
the first time you do meth.

199
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,275
If you're curious, give it a try.

200
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:28,529
You didn't let him inject that
because you got curious, right?

201
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:30,573
Though you could've had him way before?

202
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,202
You overestimate me.

203
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:38,623
Wait, I never knew you could smile.

204
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:42,043
It's the drug. That's frightening.

205
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:44,462
Right.

206
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,720
He's the one who visited Ki Du-seong.

207
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,890
<i>He is Choi Jae-cheol. He worked</i>
<i>for an ankle monitor manufacturer.</i>

208
00:13:56,808 --> 00:14:00,686
<i>He was imprisoned for embezzlement,</i>
<i>and met Lee Man-ho in prison at that time.</i>

209
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,567
<i>So that's why he could take</i>
<i>the ankle monitor on and off.</i>

210
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:09,195
<i>Once Lee sues the keyboard warriors</i>
<i>and makes a fortune,</i>

211
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:10,947
<i>they were going to split it in half.</i>

212
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,198
Darn it!

213
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,118
Choi Jae-cheol is the bridge
between Lee and Ki Du-seong?

214
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:19,705
If Lee Man-ho instigated Ki Du-seong
to kill you through Choi Jae-cheol,

215
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:21,999
he'd be the one who killed my uncle

216
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,836
and instigated your murder.

217
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,337
My gut feelings are right.

218
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,548
Professor!

219
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,008
The jury reached a verdict.

220
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,599
And now, the verdict

221
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,726
for case 2020-GH 311…

222
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,644
DEFENSE ATTORNEY

223
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:45,356
on causing grievous bodily injury
will be announced.

224
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,004
The jury have unanimously decided

225
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:14,177
to accept the defendant's case
for self-defense.

226
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,220
-Yes!
-All right!

227
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:22,852
Order.

228
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,690
As previously stated,
the verdict of the jury

229
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:31,903
only has an advisory effect
in the judge's decision.

230
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:38,951
I will announce the ruling.

231
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,955
Case 2020-GH 311…

232
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,005
What happened?

233
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,348
Come in! Damn it.

234
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,520
Stop any articles on Yeong-chang
from getting published.

235
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:08,940
And move him to a hospital
in a rural area.

236
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:11,817
-Don't let any reporters find him!
-Yes, sir.

237
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:15,446
Right, the ruling
of the Bad FaMa case just came out.

238
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,158
The articles on Bad FaMa

239
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,702
covered up the articles
on Ko Hyeong-su's son.

240
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:22,995
BAD FAMA FOUND INNOCENT

241
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,831
And it's all thanks
to Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

242
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,501
Why is it thanks to him? I made it happen.

243
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:31,254
I played a good part
as a member of the jury.

244
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:32,880
Didn't you just stay silent?

245
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:33,965
Come on.

246
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,133
I knew it'd be ruled self-defense.

247
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,594
Didn't you say you were doubtful?

248
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,806
Although it's pretty late,

249
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,307
you all have done well,

250
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:45,101
so please eat up.

251
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,186
Especially you…

252
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:51,065
-Ye-seul.
-Thank you.

253
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:54,986
The tab is on the dean tonight,
so let's eat until we all blow up.

254
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:56,529
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

255
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,865
Where's our man of the day,
Professor Yang?

256
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,285
He's probably catching up with someone.

257
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:08,040
My perfect winning rate
on jury trials was destroyed,

258
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:09,959
but why is the night air so refreshing?

259
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:14,171
I didn't know
you loved your students that much.

260
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:17,133
You applied to be her special attorney
and won her case.

261
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:21,262
Did you turn it into a jury trial

262
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:23,306
because you knew
I always take jury trials?

263
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:27,184
And you knew I'd stop Prosecutor Jin
from trying to pull a trick.

264
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:32,273
Don't be so happy though.
During the appeal--

265
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,446
Sim-won.

266
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:44,076
I know you very well
you won't lodge an appeal.

267
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:48,205
You'd think it's a waste,
an abuse of the right to appeal.

268
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,001
Yes, Ko Yeong-chang is a huge jerk indeed.

269
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,296
But if Ko Yeong-chang asks for an appeal,

270
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,673
I don't have the courage
to ignore it as abuse.

271
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,551
The woman I know you to be
probably does have it.

272
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:01,552
Really?

273
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,971
You turned down someone that cool?

274
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,728
There's the guy
who got lucky thanks to you.

275
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:14,940
I'll pay you back
for causing damage on my reputation,

276
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,650
so see you around. Bye.

277
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,411
<i>Aren't you coming?</i>

278
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:28,954
HAN JOON-HWI

279
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,999
KOREAN FULL-COURSE MEAL

280
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,047
The dean rarely buys us a meal, you know.

281
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:50,101
Do you think Assemblyman Ko

282
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,229
really wanted Bad FaMa
to be found innocent?

283
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,650
Do you think he wanted
to introduce a bill to abolish

284
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:00,027
defamation by publicly alleging facts?

285
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:02,947
I doubt it.

286
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:08,327
You've worked with him in his office.

287
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,581
You know that he's a man
who wants to work with legislations

288
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,918
that would help out his career
more than the people.

289
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:20,256
And you played a part in helping him
find something for his career.

290
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,634
I was desperate.

291
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,764
Isn't that what you wrote
with your bloody nose?

292
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,686
That she did it out of desperation
as it's a matter of the kids' survival.

293
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:37,982
So did I take part?

294
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:39,817
Yes.

295
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:43,362
I gave him the Lee Man-ho Act, too.

296
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:45,781
The Lee Man-ho Act?

297
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,827
He was the key member
of the Judiciary Committee.

298
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,370
No one else could've passed it.

299
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:54,498
That's…

300
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,083
Was it Kang Dan?

301
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:00,254
Prof. Yang told me later
that a student at Hankuk University

302
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,715
proposed that bill.

303
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:08,095
Let's go inside.
We're keeping everyone waiting.

304
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:10,681
Kang Dan is…

305
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:15,227
my sister.

306
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,608
I was trying to say
we should both be careful.

307
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,863
Why do you turn a cautionary measure
into a careless mistake?

308
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:29,074
Seo Ji-ho is a nobody. Why did you take
the case to the prosecution?

309
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,499
In his father's death, we obviously--

310
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:37,750
We played a part in it?

311
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:41,712
Hey, Mr. Choi.

312
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:50,095
Do you think we were the main culprits?

313
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,807
I didn't leak it because I wanted to.

314
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,772
My superior at the time, Seo Byung-ju,
despised leaking out suspected crimes.

315
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,441
-Then why…
-Why?

316
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:10,824
That's the reason why you should never
stab me in the back.

317
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:18,624
Actually, the one you stabbed

318
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,920
in the back is not me.

319
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,637
I guess you haven't heard.
The real culprit was caught.

320
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,889
What?

321
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,058
He was caught trying to kill me.

322
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,394
What the heck are you…

323
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,233
I never imagined I'd get caught in a trap.

324
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:46,902
I thought I should do it for you
as an insurance plan.

325
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,701
Jae-cheol spilled everything.

326
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,996
He said you killed Seo Byung-ju.

327
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:02,084
Are you allowed to question me
at such a late hour?

328
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:06,255
It's not like I want to be here.

329
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:13,512
I'm not done with the questioning.

330
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:16,056
Darn it.

331
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:18,517
Come on.

332
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:31,280
You tried to kill Jong-hoon?

333
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:33,282
I'm pleading the Fifth

334
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,826
until I get myself a lawyer.

335
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:37,369
And Seo Byung-ju.

336
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:40,539
Did you really kill him?

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,960
I refuse to state anything.

338
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,094
Hey, let's go for another drink!

339
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,138
Tell Yangcrates to come!

340
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,807
<i>My head is too clear. I came home.</i>

341
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,601
The real culprit

342
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,062
is caught.

343
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:05,064
-What?
-What?

344
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:07,107
The real culprit who killed Prof. Seo?

345
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,820
That's how Lee Man-ho made his alibi?

346
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:15,199
How dare he mess with the ankle monitor?

347
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,451
That's what money does.

348
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:20,537
Shouldn't Jae-cheol be considered
as an accomplice?

349
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:23,248
I wouldn't call him an accomplice,
but an aider.

350
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:24,583
Aider.

351
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,876
That's way too weak.

352
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,669
I mean, he messed with the anklet.

353
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,298
Look at how happy you are.

354
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,759
Weren't you pondering
why you wanted to be a lawyer?

355
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:36,845
No, seeing Ye-seul getting found innocent
made me realize

356
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,555
that I was born to be a lawyer.

357
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,516
I will…

358
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:43,018
just go home, then.

359
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,104
Why? You said no one's home.

360
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:47,606
My roommate went home, so stay with me.

361
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:48,524
She went home?

362
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:50,609
Are you concerned?

363
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:52,277
Why? Are you jealous?

364
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,779
Don't be so cute.

365
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,159
Wait, you left with the slippers
from the restaurant?

366
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,666
No matter how out of it you were--

367
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,129
It's not because she was out of it.

368
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:25,602
Hey. When did you come home?

369
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:28,355
I have something to say, Dad, Mom.

370
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,067
Something to say?

371
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:34,153
No! Have you gone insane?

372
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,908
Prof. Yang won't let this pass.

373
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,202
He's only giving me time
as Joon-hwi asked him.

374
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,537
No, you can't do that.

375
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,372
I'll die if you get kicked out.

376
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:48,750
I've never imagined you
as anything else than a judge!

377
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,796
Honey, do something.

378
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:56,800
I apologize for comparing you to Byung-ju,

379
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:59,011
so please do something.

380
00:24:59,094 --> 00:24:59,970
Honey.

381
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:03,348
Yes, I'm your wife.

382
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:05,601
Please help save me.

383
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:08,228
If she gets kicked out of the law school,
I'll die.

384
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:12,107
I'd rather have you quit.

385
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,277
But not our daughter.
Our daughter can't get kicked out.

386
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,404
No, please.

387
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:18,530
I'm going to sleep.

388
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:24,745
No, honey.

389
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,631
I got you a change of clothes
from your room.

390
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:45,766
<i>When I asked Prof. Yang about Kang Dan,</i>

391
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,267
<i>he refused to say another word.</i>

392
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:51,605
She volunteered at a children's home
during high school,

393
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,483
and she must've looked after
Lee Man-ho's son.

394
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:02,241
I'm glad I gave you that bill

395
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,535
and sent you to Assemblyman Ko.

396
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,709
Right.

397
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:16,129
What does she want to do now?

398
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:18,966
She only did Ko Hyeong-su good.

399
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:27,891
<i>Thanks to you,</i>
<i>I began to trust the law again.</i>

400
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,186
Yes, let's focus on her innocence,

401
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,105
just how she was found innocent.

402
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,400
Gosh, I'm just glad
she was found innocent.

403
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:49,955
Mom, did you get home all right?

404
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:52,249
Yes, I got home just fine.

405
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:55,335
But some jerk destroyed our CCTV.

406
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:56,587
<i>We don't need it anymore.</i>

407
00:26:57,087 --> 00:26:58,922
<i>Lee Man-ho won't live across from you.</i>

408
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:00,007
What do you mean?

409
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,926
He was the real culprit
of the murder case at our school.

410
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,387
He'll rot in prison forever.

411
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,056
Goodness, that's frightening.

412
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:11,184
You and Byeol can sleep in peace now.

413
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:12,644
Goodness.

414
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:14,688
Anyway, Mom.

415
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,400
I really wasn't sure about Juror no. 2.
How did you unanimously…

416
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,985
No, never mind.

417
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:22,195
You can't disclose the discussion.

418
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,448
Of course, I can't. If I do,

419
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:26,992
they told me
I'll either be fined or locked up.

420
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:31,204
I'm going to sleep in peace now.

421
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:33,832
Good night. Great work today.

422
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,339
What happened

423
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,133
with Juror no. 2 is…

424
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,511
Should we consider
his violation of her rights

425
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:49,848
continued even after he dropped his phone?

426
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:52,100
That's the key issue.

427
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:54,978
The Supreme Court precedents say

428
00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:58,523
it's very difficult
to prove that continuity.

429
00:27:58,607 --> 00:27:59,983
It should be difficult.

430
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,152
She still made him paraplegic.

431
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:05,656
She should be punished in some way.

432
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:08,784
But I wouldn't say imprisonment,
more like probation.

433
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,702
It wasn't your fault.

434
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,206
It wasn't your fault.

435
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:17,167
She really isn't helpful.

436
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,002
<i>It wasn't the defendant's fault.</i>

437
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:24,800
Stop talking! It's not self-defense!

438
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:26,551
-Darn you.
-Goodness.

439
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:28,261
-Hey!
-Stop.

440
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:32,474
Doesn't this look exactly like

441
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:35,185
how Ko Yeong-chang
reached for his phone in the footage?

442
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:39,189
Prosecutor, you thought the continuity
of his violation ended here.

443
00:28:39,272 --> 00:28:40,565
Is that really the case?

444
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:43,235
If he reaches out to pick up this knife,

445
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:46,154
it means
his injustice against me continues.

446
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:47,197
Because of that fear…

447
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:51,159
this was all I could do.

448
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:52,119
You really hit me.

449
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,457
Shouldn't we consider the violation
to finally end at this point?

450
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,126
Right.

451
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:01,878
We should say the continuity stands.

452
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:05,382
I say it was self-defense.

453
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:15,058
Prosecutor Jin will have a tough night.

454
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:18,395
Ye-seul was found innocent,
and the real culprit was caught.

455
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:21,940
And Mr. Choi went to the prosecution
to share his witness account,

456
00:29:22,024 --> 00:29:23,608
so he's probably furious.

457
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:28,447
This is probably
the worst day of his life.

458
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:34,286
What about you?

459
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:36,538
Why can't you sleep?

460
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,248
Do you think…

461
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,543
Prosecutor Jin will be indicted?

462
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:46,048
He said something weird.

463
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:48,175
Something weird?

464
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,677
That what I see isn't everything.

465
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:54,347
That my dad died without knowing

466
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:56,641
the substantial truth.

467
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:07,903
BAD FAMA FOUND INNOCENT FOR DEFAMATION

468
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:09,112
LEE MAN-HO ATTACKS KO

469
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:10,197
HIS BILL PROPOSAL…

470
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,373
Are you sure Lee Man-ho is

471
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,293
the real culprit?

472
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:26,546
Yes, sir.

473
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:29,591
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

474
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:34,596
These are the shoes he wore.

475
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:41,269
These are the same model.

476
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:43,480
And the soles.

477
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:50,737
The soles are the same as those
of the sneakers he was wearing.

478
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:52,531
The medical examiner said

479
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:53,990
the needle mark you see here

480
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,536
is the same as the one on this syringe.

481
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:02,499
Seung-jae said this is made in Germany,
and not often used in Korea.

482
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:04,251
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

483
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:06,962
<i>On top of that, Choi Jae-cheol destroyed</i>
<i>all of his alibis.</i>

484
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,257
Jae-cheol put the anklet on

485
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:13,593
instead of him
at the exact time of the incident.

486
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,597
It means Lee Man-ho is the real culprit.

487
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:21,601
Goodness.

488
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,190
There's no reason to lose heart.

489
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:29,776
Persuade Jae-cheol
and make it look like you caught

490
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:32,112
the culprit.

491
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:35,615
But the thing is,

492
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:38,743
Yang Jong-hoon contacted him first, so--

493
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:41,079
Then find out
how he contacted Choi Jae-cheol.

494
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:42,247
You'll find something.

495
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,837
I stopped articles on Lee's arrest
from getting published.

496
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:51,256
Hand it over to Reporter Choi

497
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:55,719
and let him publish the exclusive report.

498
00:31:57,888 --> 00:31:59,472
Tell him to walk back his remarks.

499
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:06,271
No, I don't want to do an interview.

500
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,485
He took this and walked back his remarks?

501
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:15,947
Yes. He won't pick up my calls.
I'm thinking of visiting him.

502
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:18,200
He's a wasted chance.

503
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:23,538
Why do you think Prosecutor Jin took Lee
to the prosecution that quickly?

504
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,041
In an attempt to blame the police
for pointing at you

505
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,459
with poor investigation.

506
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,961
And will they simply agree
it was their fault?

507
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:35,133
I think Prosecutor Jin
wants to blame the police.

508
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:38,094
The police got furious saying
they could've righted the wrong

509
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:40,222
if he didn't leak out his suspected crime.

510
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:43,225
Were they Detective Jang and Oh?
I'm going to meet with them.

511
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:45,435
Good luck.

512
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,063
Hey.

513
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:51,441
Which floor is Prof. Yang's office on?

514
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:58,823
At the exact time of the incident,

515
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:02,410
your ankle monitor location
appears at this cafe

516
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:05,372
next to Attorney Seo Byung-ju's office.

517
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:11,253
But the one who was here with the anklet
wasn't you, but Choi Jae-cheol.

518
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,798
Right? Do you know what this means--

519
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:17,717
I demand a cross-examination
with Choi Jae-cheol.

520
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:26,977
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

521
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,854
This is Attorney Song Ki-joon,
Choi Jae-cheol's counsel.

522
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,066
You can talk to him.

523
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,781
Darn it.

524
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,076
<i>You want us to testify</i>

525
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,997
that Prosecutor Jin leaked
his suspected crime to the media?

526
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,123
Yes.

527
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:55,714
Are you insane?

528
00:33:55,797 --> 00:33:59,509
He did piss me off, but why would I
mess with a prosecutor?

529
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,638
Detective Jang, Detective Oh,
this is a matter of your honor.

530
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,853
According to his media source,

531
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:13,565
the police turned a talented law professor
into a murderer

532
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:15,650
because of the poor initial investigation.

533
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,319
Prosecutor Jin told the media

534
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:20,113
even before we transferred his case
to the prosecution.

535
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:22,782
Man, that jerk.

536
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:23,700
And that jerk

537
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:28,163
leaked my dad's suspected crime
before he was found guilty,

538
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,833
then he ended up setting himself on fire.

539
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,793
Please help me out.

540
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:54,022
<i>Helping out Seo Ji-ho</i>
<i>is the right way to apologize to me.</i>

541
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:57,442
Whatever!

542
00:34:57,525 --> 00:35:00,195
I still see my dad on fire in my dreams.

543
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:11,539
I can't believe this.

544
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:12,457
LIST OF SUPPORTERS

545
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,710
Ko's case got covered, and the number
of the supporters skyrocketed.

546
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:19,172
Do they have enough trust in him
to give him money?

547
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,673
This is doubly annoying.

548
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:22,717
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

549
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,553
Why isn't she coming?

550
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:27,138
It's awkward to be here alone.

551
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:31,851
Hey, where are you?

552
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:34,104
I had to come to school first.

553
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:36,439
DEAN'S OFFICE

554
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:41,694
The head supporter?

555
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:43,071
KO HYEONG-SU

556
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:45,907
Why is he holding that toy up?
That's so cheap.

557
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:48,284
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

558
00:35:48,368 --> 00:35:50,328
I have the documents he requested.

559
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:53,915
Kang Sol B had to stop by the school
before she got here.

560
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,708
She doesn't need to come.

561
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,044
Sorry?

562
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:05,593
-If it's about the plagiarism--
-I did plagiarize.

563
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:11,683
I could've written that paper myself,

564
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:13,435
but I copied his.

565
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:16,604
Why are you telling us now?

566
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,985
Han Joon-hwi said
he helped his uncle write that paper.

567
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:23,570
He did?

568
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:26,865
I thought I needed to tell you the truth
and ask for the best

569
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:29,200
in order to avoid getting kicked out.

570
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,621
And the vice dean?

571
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:35,915
I told him yesterday.

572
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,334
I had to stop him from resigning.

573
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:42,755
But you don't look ashamed.

574
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,383
I'm sorry.

575
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:49,179
I look more shameless
with a guilty conscience.

576
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,326
Will you really be like this?

577
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:16,664
You need to get me a good lawyer
from a big firm like Hyeongseol!

578
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,377
That's not what you promised--

579
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:24,172
Hello? Hey…

580
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,010
Darn it.

581
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,514
Is it okay to leave them alone?

582
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:37,769
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

583
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,148
PROSECUTOR LEE HAN-JU

584
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:04,671
Criminal Procedure Act Article 255.1.

585
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:07,632
You need to do that.

586
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,842
You did that to me, too.

587
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:11,302
You seem to do it often.

588
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:19,852
ARTICLE 255.1

589
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,145
Withdrawal of prosecution.

590
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:23,606
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

591
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,316
We have more than enough evidence.

592
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:28,570
The more you hold out, the more severely--

593
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,446
Why are you in such a rush?

594
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:35,493
I have to find myself an attorney first.

595
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:38,663
Let's take this slow, okay?

596
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:42,166
Be my guest.

597
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:47,046
Take him.

598
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,059
There's something more important
than my confession.

599
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:04,188
I can't believe
a smart guy like you missed that.

600
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:09,856
Motive for the murder?

601
00:39:10,523 --> 00:39:12,400
Why did he kill him?

602
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,403
He's an organ trafficker and a rapist.
He can do worse.

603
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,989
He said it was because of his son.

604
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:19,532
His son?

605
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,367
Did Seo Byung-ju hurt him?

606
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:24,662
He found him feeble-minded

607
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:27,373
and even got him a job after he got
released, so why?

608
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:34,046
Gosh, you can now start giving lectures
with that textbook.

609
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,591
Prosecutor Jin withdrew your indictment.

610
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:41,429
Congratulations on the dismissal
of your label as the Law School Murderer.

611
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,558
Couldn't you thank me and say

612
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:47,602
I did a great job
even if you don't mean it?

613
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,228
Don't get your hopes up.

614
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:51,981
Just be grateful
your name was made known in return.

615
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,025
But he could still say thanks.

616
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,777
"Great job, Park.

617
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,362
You had a tough time
dealing with a cranky client…"

618
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,282
Who cares if he's cranky?

619
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,534
He's much better
than a jerk like Lee Man-ho.

620
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:06,871
Even public defenders
abhor the thought of defending him.

621
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,247
Abhorrence is a stretch.

622
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,209
-I'd do it if he pays me enough.
-Sure.

623
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:13,044
You go ahead and do it.

624
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:15,755
He's the guy who tried to kill
your client, but just do it.

625
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,257
-I…
-You don't even have an ounce of loyalty.

626
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,345
His indictment is canceled,
so he's not my client anymore.

627
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:23,387
I need to see you.

628
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,139
What?

629
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,352
I thought we were all done.

630
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:30,853
Presidency, my foot.

631
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,480
He's a petty man who fired us

632
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,150
over a personal matter
after his son's trial went down the drain.

633
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,694
It's not like I wanted to work there.

634
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:42,406
I would've been done with my internship
after a few days.

635
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,660
Gosh, should I have acted crazy
and held out?

636
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:48,830
What was that?

637
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:52,166
-Hop in.
-What?

638
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,209
My gosh.

639
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,546
She said she's more shameless
with a guilty conscience,

640
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,548
then made the dean and me speechless.

641
00:40:58,631 --> 00:40:59,924
But she felt guilty.

642
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,510
Her conscience?
Of course, she should feel guilty.

643
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,345
But wait.

644
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,931
You're glad that she felt guilty at least?

645
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,517
You can't stand people like Sol B.

646
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,768
I can't stand her.

647
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,144
COVER LETTER: KANG SOL

648
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:14,146
I read her cover letter all over again,

649
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,316
but it didn't say anything
about winning an award with that paper.

650
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,026
Didn't she attach the certificate?

651
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,361
Well, she did.

652
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,531
But we only acknowledge awards
given by chancellors,

653
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,908
governors, mayors, or ministers.

654
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:28,870
This award was given
by the Asia Human Rights Law Association,

655
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:32,081
so it wasn't taken into account.

656
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:34,417
So this paper
didn't affect her acceptance?

657
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:38,212
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

658
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,969
This time, I'll leave
even if you rip this up.

659
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:50,182
We haven't reached a decision
on your daughter's punishment.

660
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,101
It's all my fault.

661
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:54,854
I'd like to take responsibility
for causing this scandal.

662
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,443
Han Joon-hwi came to see me,

663
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:03,779
asking for favorable arrangements
for Kang Sol B.

664
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:05,072
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

665
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,867
If that's what this resignation means…

666
00:42:08,951 --> 00:42:10,369
Please punish her by the rules.

667
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:21,422
It looked like
Vice Dean Kang was set on resigning.

668
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,673
You should talk to him.

669
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,597
Did things go well with Prosecutor Bae?

670
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,182
She won't appeal.

671
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:33,684
No.

672
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,024
I mean, you and I go way back.

673
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:41,817
That's why you should run.

674
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:43,152
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

675
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:50,868
Why won't she lodge an appeal?

676
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:55,915
In that case, I'll visit you next time.

677
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:56,874
Goodbye.

678
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,967
Prosecutor Bae insisted that
it's an abuse of the right to appeal.

679
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,219
What? An abuse of the right to appeal?

680
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,721
-Get her on the phone!
-I already talked to her,

681
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:12,306
and she told me to tell you

682
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,601
it'll be a better choice for Yeong-chang
for you to drop this case,

683
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:19,981
and how you should be grateful that
Ye-seul didn't sue him for dating abuse.

684
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,190
What?

685
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:23,859
Prosecutor Bae, you…

686
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,153
I need to see Prosecutor Jin!

687
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:30,408
-You were fired from Ko's office, too?
-Yes.

688
00:43:31,951 --> 00:43:33,452
What about the internship?

689
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,163
What will you do?

690
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:39,500
-I can find another law firm.
-The accusation.

691
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:42,461
Right.

692
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:45,047
My key witness backed out,

693
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:47,675
so the detectives who worked
with Jin stepped up.

694
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,218
The ones for your dad's case?

695
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:51,095
No, for Prof. Yang's.

696
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,723
Their words aren't the smoking gun,

697
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:56,809
but it can show how Prosecutor Jin
had been leaking information.

698
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:01,105
Why do you think
Prosecutor Jin attended Ye-seul's trial?

699
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,649
By chance?

700
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,318
<i>Why do you think I sat in on this trial?</i>

701
00:44:06,902 --> 00:44:09,196
Who benefitted the most
after Prosecutor Jin

702
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,823
leaked your dad's suspected crime?

703
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,916
KO HYEONG-SU

704
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,712
The toy company
that had been competing with your dad's.

705
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,921
I-bit?

706
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:28,591
CEO Cho Tae-yeong of I-bit
is Ko's head supporter.

707
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,177
What?

708
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:34,805
<i>You should know the substantial truth</i>
<i>to get into law.</i>

709
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,224
The substantial truth.

710
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:40,811
Then did Prosecutor Jin do that
upon Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su's request?

711
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:53,199
What? The most effective angle
in taking photos of a partner's affair?

712
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:54,784
What kind of an angle…

713
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,579
It's more about your speed than the angle.
Take the photos

714
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,498
as soon as you kick open the door.

715
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:02,917
Cameras are slower,
so use your phone camera.

716
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,503
Please come to my office
for further consultation.

717
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:06,420
The address.

718
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:07,379
Yes, sir.

719
00:45:08,798 --> 00:45:10,674
Why am I here?

720
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:14,261
You got fired from your internship.
Do it here.

721
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:16,847
Here? I freaking hate it.

722
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,183
I freaking hate you, too.

723
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:22,311
I'm only doing this for you
because Prof. Yang asked.

724
00:45:22,394 --> 00:45:24,355
What? Prof. Yang?

725
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:25,481
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

726
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:28,400
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

727
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:31,904
Was Assemblyman Ko behind you?

728
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,408
Did he take money from I-bit's CEO--

729
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:39,745
If you don't want to see him
get dragged out, take him outside.

730
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:41,205
Tell me!

731
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,544
You can't do this here. Hey.

732
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:47,711
Calm down and come.

733
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:48,712
-Calm--
-Let me go!

734
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,297
Calm down for now.

735
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,757
Come on out. Come.

736
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,845
-Let me go!
-That's enough.

737
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:58,347
-Let me go!
-Enough is enough, really.

738
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:06,272
Will you go back inside?

739
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:07,690
What?

740
00:46:08,274 --> 00:46:09,483
You're saying I'm out?

741
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:13,863
Tell him you persuaded him to leave
and get the kudos.

742
00:46:21,036 --> 00:46:23,747
Okay, then. Try to calm down.

743
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:26,208
Bye.

744
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,176
You knew, didn't you?

745
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:48,856
Why didn't you tell me?

746
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:51,609
I knew you'd do this.

747
00:46:57,865 --> 00:47:00,200
You know nothing good can come
from doing this,

748
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,078
but you'd still do it.

749
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,819
So you're Seo Ji-ho's roommate?

750
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:39,365
Tell him to get a grip and wake up.

751
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:43,702
I'm sorry to tell you this
right before my internship is over.

752
00:47:45,788 --> 00:47:46,830
I don't think

753
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,750
I can work for you anymore.

754
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:51,585
What?

755
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:55,673
I plan to do everything I can
to help Ji-ho prove your guilt.

756
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:00,427
And it'd be a conflict of interest
to stay here

757
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,720
and share the same office.

758
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:05,599
Prosecutor Lee.

759
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:10,396
He wants to help you investigate my case.

760
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:12,773
I'll send him there. Good luck.

761
00:48:14,066 --> 00:48:14,984
Happy now?

762
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:19,154
Yes, thank you.

763
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,115
I'll do a good job.

764
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:27,955
Prof. Yang.

765
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:37,548
Prof. Yang.

766
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,175
Why did you refer me to Mr. Park's--

767
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:41,844
He'll take Lee Man-ho's case.

768
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,929
Help him during your internship.

769
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:45,389
What?

770
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:51,145
Cheers, guys. Cheers.

771
00:49:08,454 --> 00:49:10,831
Over here.

772
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,586
You already got drunk without me?

773
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:17,838
Yes, your friend

774
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:21,425
feels really frustrated right here,

775
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:24,845
and feels like her head
is about to blow up.

776
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,139
So I got drunk.

777
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,767
Because of Lee Man-ho?

778
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:32,895
Hey, you know,

779
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,273
I really have no idea
why the law should protect

780
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:39,860
those scumbags like Lee Man-ho.

781
00:49:41,403 --> 00:49:42,529
Do you know, Joon-hwi?

782
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:46,116
Do people who pass
the second-round judicial exam know that?

783
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,205
Figures.

784
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:01,215
I'm jealous of you.

785
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:04,968
You could be a future prosecutor.

786
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:07,805
How are prosecutors different?

787
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:09,056
They're different.

788
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:13,811
You won't have to worry about
what you can do to reduce the sentence

789
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,604
for a scumbag like Lee Man-ho.

790
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:18,607
Quarter him to death!

791
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,609
Punish him severely!

792
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,402
You can do that.

793
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,242
I was really thankful

794
00:50:28,784 --> 00:50:32,704
that Lee Man-ho disappeared
from the house across mine.

795
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:36,333
But why the heck is Prof. Yang telling me
to help defend him?

796
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:39,253
How does this make any sense?

797
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,423
It makes no sense.

798
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,724
-Go!
-We're late!

799
00:50:55,811 --> 00:50:57,354
CAN WE DEFEND BAD PEOPLE?

800
00:50:57,437 --> 00:50:58,981
LECTURE ROOM

801
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,943
In this lecture today,

802
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:07,531
I'd like you to have a discussion
as future officers in law,

803
00:51:07,614 --> 00:51:10,450
freed from your stress over grades
and your bar exam.

804
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,203
Stop acting like you're a sinner.

805
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:19,251
You got me, Ji-ho, and this girl
fired from our internships.

806
00:51:20,252 --> 00:51:23,213
Think of everything we did to help
and be confident.

807
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:26,592
LECTURE ROOM

808
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,553
"Why do I want to be a lawyer?"

809
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:31,722
We didn't exactly get fired
because of you.

810
00:51:31,805 --> 00:51:34,433
"What kind of lawyer do I want to be?"

811
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:42,566
When you work for justice
and the benefit of your client as lawyers,

812
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:44,151
you'll face this problem first.

813
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:47,404
Can we defend bad people?

814
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:50,991
And of course, by bad people,

815
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,035
I mean atrocious criminals

816
00:51:53,118 --> 00:51:55,329
who committed a serious crime.

817
00:51:56,955 --> 00:52:00,334
Now, can any of you
answer that with confidence?

818
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,254
CAN WE DEFEND BAD PEOPLE?

819
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:07,049
Latecomers,
can you each give me an answer?

820
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:09,259
Can you defend a bad person?

821
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,348
Article 12.4 of the Constitution says,

822
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,725
"Any person who is
arrested or detained shall have

823
00:52:16,808 --> 00:52:18,852
the right
to prompt assistance of counsel."

824
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:23,315
But I still don't think
I can defend a bad person.

825
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:24,566
Why can't you do it?

826
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,320
I feel like I'll become a bad person too
while defending a guy like him.

827
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:29,655
Then don't take the bar.

828
00:52:29,738 --> 00:52:31,031
Prof. Yang.

829
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:34,159
You cannot turn down a client
just because he or she is a bad person

830
00:52:34,243 --> 00:52:35,827
denounced by the whole world.

831
00:52:36,703 --> 00:52:39,206
Even bad people
have the right to be defended.

832
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:42,709
If you're afraid
defending him will make you bad,

833
00:52:43,418 --> 00:52:44,962
Attorneys-at-Law Act Article 24…

834
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:47,839
Attorneys-at-Law Act Article 24,
Duty to Maintain Dignity.

835
00:52:47,923 --> 00:52:51,551
Paragraph One, attorneys cannot
do anything to damage his or her dignity.

836
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,346
Paragraph Two, attorneys are prohibited

837
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:56,848
from concealing the truth
or making false statements.

838
00:52:56,932 --> 00:52:59,268
If we can maintain our dignity,
there is no reason

839
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:00,352
to not defend them.

840
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:01,520
Whatever.

841
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:06,525
Back then,
if any attorneys stood on your side,

842
00:53:06,608 --> 00:53:09,194
you may not have ended up
going to a juvie.

843
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:13,407
<i>You don't care</i>
<i>how it'll go down in history,</i>

844
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:16,827
but you only seek the judicial truth?

845
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,287
I see.

846
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:22,124
Ye-seul, what do you think?

847
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:27,546
I'm not sure yet.

848
00:53:28,422 --> 00:53:32,009
I don't know if I have a right
to defend the good or the bad.

849
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,762
May I…

850
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:38,515
provide you the answer?

851
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:43,977
HAPPY CORRECTION, HAPPY PEOPLE

852
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:47,356
What were you thinking
when you got me an attorney?

853
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:50,859
It's not like you'll find out anything.

854
00:53:50,942 --> 00:53:53,487
I'm sure you're aware
of his obligation to keep silent.

855
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,782
I know that very well.
So I want to hear it from you.

856
00:53:59,618 --> 00:54:01,953
You murdered Seo Byung-ju
because of your son?

857
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,624
Did I say that?

858
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,420
I didn't have a drop of alcohol,

859
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:12,631
but I can't seem to remember.

860
00:54:12,714 --> 00:54:13,840
And your insurance plan?

861
00:54:14,424 --> 00:54:17,469
You said you let me live
as an insurance plan.

862
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:19,971
That means
you'll be put in an anxious position

863
00:54:20,055 --> 00:54:21,556
once I die and disappear.

864
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,393
That could mean someone might be
involved in this murder.

865
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:27,854
For example, it could've been instigated
by someone, a murder by contract.

866
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,483
I see.

867
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:34,611
You'd rather die than go to prison,
but you needed to find your son.

868
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:36,988
So you killed him as you were told,
then blamed me.

869
00:54:37,656 --> 00:54:41,618
Yet you're nothing but a ticking bomb
to the instigators of your murder,

870
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:44,871
so in case they try to get rid of you,

871
00:54:44,955 --> 00:54:46,915
you hoped that I'd stay alive.

872
00:54:51,503 --> 00:54:52,546
I'm alive and well,

873
00:54:54,756 --> 00:54:57,050
and it looks like they abandoned you.

874
00:54:58,844 --> 00:55:00,429
So now, tell me something.

875
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:16,194
What should I tell you?

876
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:18,572
You know what.

877
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:20,574
Your sentence will drop significantly

878
00:55:20,657 --> 00:55:22,492
if it's instigated by another.

879
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:36,047
What did he say?

880
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:39,426
My gosh.
There was no use in acting as your driver.

881
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:41,386
Hop in.

882
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:01,698
<i>Hello?</i>

883
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:04,826
I'd like to ask you
about Lee Man-ho's son.

884
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:06,953
<i>I have nothing to tell you.</i>

885
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:10,248
I'll talk to you later.

886
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:12,542
Who was that?

887
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:15,587
I'll tell you later. Who was that?

888
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:17,255
Later.

889
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:23,428
So did Lee Man-ho really say

890
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:27,849
he killed Prof. Seo Byung-ju
because of his son?

891
00:56:29,976 --> 00:56:31,144
That's enough for now.

892
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:32,729
I'll call you again.

893
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:34,439
All right.

894
00:56:45,826 --> 00:56:47,202
Will you prosecute him?

895
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:52,415
Should I write up a draft?

896
00:56:54,709 --> 00:56:56,253
Hey, come on!

897
00:56:56,336 --> 00:56:58,880
How is she this strong?

898
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:01,716
Let's just go see him.
Let's go see him first, then…

899
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,301
What are you doing? Push her!

900
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:04,594
I'm not going!

901
00:57:04,678 --> 00:57:06,972
I'll puke
as soon as I see Lee Man-ho's face.

902
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:09,015
Then go puke after you see him.

903
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,060
Hey, Bok-gi!

904
00:57:12,143 --> 00:57:15,647
This is dereliction of duties.
I can't count this as your internship.

905
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,191
Sol, just come with us
and just sit there, okay?

906
00:57:18,275 --> 00:57:20,735
No, you go! I don't want to go there!

907
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,905
If only it wasn't for Prof. Yang…
I hate you, too!

908
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:26,157
Why did he put me up for this?

909
00:57:26,241 --> 00:57:28,827
How can he ask me to defend a guy
who almost killed him?

910
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,745
That's why this draws attention.

911
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:33,790
And I took it because it's great publicity
without paying a dime.

912
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:36,668
Prof. Yang defends people like Ye-seul

913
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:38,211
instead of bad guys!

914
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:39,713
Tell me about it.

915
00:57:40,964 --> 00:57:43,466
We might be stoned to death
while defending Lee Man-ho,

916
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,260
a guy everyone wants to avoid.

917
00:57:46,386 --> 00:57:48,471
And you want to be a human rights lawyer?

918
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:52,142
I did something for you that you asked
for during Ye-seul's trial.

919
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:54,769
I do one for you, and you do one for me.

920
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:57,022
That's not the same as this!

921
00:57:57,105 --> 00:57:58,398
You'll make me go deaf!

922
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:00,358
Go yell at Prof. Yang instead!

923
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:01,985
You can't even squeak before him.

924
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:04,529
Of course, I can squeak before him!
I'm good at it!

925
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,323
Squeak.

926
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:25,008
You don't plead the Fifth
when you're with your attorney.

927
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:27,385
He'd have no excuses to make.

928
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:30,305
Let's go.

929
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:35,685
Why are you so pissed?

930
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:38,188
You'd be the most thrilled that I'm here.

931
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:39,981
It'd be the best if I were not here.

932
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:41,316
You finally said something.

933
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,778
You ask him.

934
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:45,779
Ask him what?

935
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:53,203
I thought you were looking for your son.

936
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:56,039
-And you wanted him to see this?
-My gosh!

937
00:59:04,714 --> 00:59:07,509
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
CHARGE: PUBLICATION OF SUSPECTED CRIME

938
00:59:07,592 --> 00:59:09,761
THE DEFENDANT, PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U…

939
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:17,102
Goodness. This isn't easy.

940
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,230
Are you having trouble?

941
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:23,274
Do your thing. Stop minding me.

942
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:30,073
Man, I can't do this.
I need to shower with cold water.

943
00:59:30,156 --> 00:59:32,200
Don't get anywhere near my desk.

944
00:59:33,618 --> 00:59:34,452
Okay.

945
00:59:52,762 --> 00:59:55,140
THE DEFENDANT, PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

946
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:57,434
PUBLICIZED SUSPECTED CRIME
BEFORE THE INDICTMENT…

947
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:08,194
-Hey.
-Hey, he's here.

948
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:09,529
Hurry!

949
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,908
You're the first to be charged for leaking
suspected crime. How do you feel?

950
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:16,870
-Prosecutor!
-Please say something!

951
01:00:16,953 --> 01:00:17,954
-Wait!
-Say something!

952
01:00:18,038 --> 01:00:19,205
-A word!
-Wait!

953
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:22,000
ONLY THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED HAVE A FUTURE

954
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,878
Hello? Prosecutor Yang.

955
01:00:24,961 --> 01:00:26,880
I have something to say. Come see me now!

956
01:00:36,347 --> 01:00:37,182
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

957
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:45,231
Let us begin the trial
of case number 2021-GD523,

958
01:00:45,815 --> 01:00:47,400
with Jin Hyeong-u as the defendant,

959
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:50,653
for publication of facts
of suspected crime.

960
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:54,866
You can't see Lee Man-ho today.

961
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:56,910
Was he in the ambulance?

962
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:00,747
VISITOR RECEPTION

963
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,582
The defendant, Jin Hyeong-u,

964
01:01:02,665 --> 01:01:06,044
is not allowed
to publicize suspected crime

965
01:01:06,127 --> 01:01:08,963
before the indictment as a prosecutor.

966
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,341
However, in September 2016,

967
01:01:11,424 --> 01:01:13,718
during the investigation

968
01:01:13,802 --> 01:01:17,180
of Defendant Seo Gi-yeol's
suspected crime,

969
01:01:17,263 --> 01:01:21,476
he disclosed this information
to reporters Choi Jung-hyeok

970
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:24,062
and Kim Hyeon-jae
at an unspecified location

971
01:01:24,145 --> 01:01:27,065
before the indictment had been made.

972
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:31,778
Defendant.

973
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:36,074
What's your opinion
regarding your charges?

974
01:01:38,993 --> 01:01:39,953
Your Honor,

975
01:01:41,162 --> 01:01:42,997
there is no precedent of an indictment

976
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:45,250
for violating Article 126
of the Criminal Code.

977
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,918
That article was as good as dead.

978
01:01:48,461 --> 01:01:50,922
However, I stand here
as the first one to be indicted

979
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:54,592
to have a chance to share that
Article 126 of the Criminal Code

980
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:56,803
is an unconstitutional clause

981
01:01:56,886 --> 01:02:00,014
which hinders the people's right to know.

982
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:03,434
I request an adjudication
on its constitutionality.

983
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:21,786
EMERGENCY CENTER

984
01:02:26,082 --> 01:02:29,210
Choi Jae-cheol's bail request
was processed,

985
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:30,795
and he was released this morning.

986
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:33,840
But Lee Man-ho…

987
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:35,633
-What happened?
-Stabbed with a knife.

988
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:36,759
And the OR?

989
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:37,719
I'll check.

990
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:42,140
Hey. Hey! Wake up!

991
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:52,442
I can't…

992
01:02:54,027 --> 01:02:55,486
I can't go down…

993
01:02:57,238 --> 01:02:58,907
I can't go down alone.

994
01:03:10,293 --> 01:03:11,711
What about Lee Man-ho?

995
01:03:12,295 --> 01:03:14,255
Damn it.

996
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:16,466
That jerk…

997
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:20,803
That jerk…

998
01:03:22,222 --> 01:03:24,474
What about that jerk?

999
01:03:24,974 --> 01:03:27,352
That jerk…

1000
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:33,191
No. Tell me.

1001
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:35,568
Say it! Tell me!

1002

1005
01:04:10,186 --> 01:04:13,106
Accept the claim he acted
in self-defense and close the case.

1006
01:04:13,189 --> 01:04:15,608
Just give the public what they want.
