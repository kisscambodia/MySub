1
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,728
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS, CASES
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

2
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,031
When will your attorneys be here?

3
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:34,579
Call Jin Hyeong-u.

4
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,373
Why? He's a prosecutor, not an attorney.

5
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:38,625
Just call him.

6
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:43,963
Call him yourself.

7
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:45,632
With the burner phone.

8
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:53,473
A FEW DAYS AGO

9
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:55,725
But these are all circumstantial evidence.

10
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:56,976
There's no smoking gun.

11
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,689
The best thing would be catching Ko
inciting the manipulation of the comments.

12
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:02,816
But how?

13
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:05,693
There is a way.

14
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:09,405
Erica Shin.

15
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:13,785
Erica Shin.

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,871
Yeah, I spoke to Prosecutor Yang
on the phone.

17
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,790
He's a professor now.

18
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,209
Are you sure though?

19
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:24,170
-Yes, I must do this.
-If you can't do it…

20
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,089
I will do it.

21
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,340
You can just study.

22
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:33,429
A search and seizure warrant?

23
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:35,723
Do you think
the higher-ups will approve it?

24
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:37,267
Never.

25
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,354
The Criminal Procedure Act states that
any prosecutor can request warrants.

26
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:42,772
That is not the issue here.

27
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:45,441
We got Prosecutor Jin indicted,
which was unprecedented.

28
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:48,486
You sided with him
after putting me through all that trouble.

29
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:53,283
Brief the media on Ko's charges
when the warrant is issued.

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,535
He's planning to run for president,

31
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,705
so the public has the right to know
about his corruption allegations.

32
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:01,708
Have you completely lost your mind?

33
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,084
All eyes are on me right now

34
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:05,170
because I filed charges
against a prosecutor

35
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:07,255
for leaking info about a suspected crime.

36
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:08,840
And you want me to do just that?

37
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:10,717
The police will handle the briefing.

38
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:12,802
What are you thinking?

39
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:17,724
Assemblyman Ko will attack you
for publicizing the allegations.

40
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:18,975
No, he won't.

41
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:23,730
He's the one who has proposed the bill
to abolish that very law.

42
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:30,403
We should show the corrupt politicians
like Ko Hyeong-su

43
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:32,989
that Article 126 of the Criminal Code

44
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:34,908
does not exist to shield them.

45
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:37,493
So it all depends on the warrant.

46
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:41,205
People like Ko Hyeong-su may have allies,
but they also have many enemies.

47
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:42,373
That's true.

48
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:45,418
I heard Judge Kang Seong-man,
who handles all warrant requests,

49
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,128
is a man of integrity.

50
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:49,505
Apparently,
everyone in his family is a judge…

51
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,759
Kang Seong-man? Kang Ju-man…

52
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:56,262
-Prof. Kang Ju-man?
-I saw him in his family portrait.

53
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:11,653
Hello?

54
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:14,572
Hey, are you on the plane?

55
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,076
What?

56
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,495
CAFÉ RITA COFFEE

57
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,664
Ko Hyeong-su doesn't trust anyone easily.

58
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:25,458
Calm Sol A down so she won't give it away.

59
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,460
Stop shaking my sister around.

60
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:30,296
Let her focus on her studies and graduate.

61
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,216
Let her focus on her studies.
Let her focus.

62
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:39,973
Yes, we're here too.

63
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,021

Kang Dan,
you became a success as Erica Shin

70
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:11,004
all thanks to me, right?

71
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,805
I hope Yang Jong-hoon remembers that.

72
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:23,391
I will remember that.

73
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:24,559
KO HYEONG-SU

ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

75
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,355
All right, now.
I'm Park Geun-tae, an attorney.

76
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,899
You know me. I'm Park Geun-tae.

INCOMING CALL

79
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,241
-Hello?
-Detective Jang?

80
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,160
KO HYEONG-SU

81
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:44,162
Kang Dan, you.

82
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,456
You'll have to pay for this!

83
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:47,707
Right.

84
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,044
Ms. Kang Dan's appendix burst,
so she never got on the plane.

85
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:52,920
What?

86
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:10,813
You rats…

87
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:12,690
How dare you.

88
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:16,110
How dare you fool me!

89
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,488
Don't lose your temper just yet.

90
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,031
This is only the beginning.

91
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,826
Gosh, this was so uncomfortable.

92
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,664
NOTICE

93
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,792
What is this?

94
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,085
SPECIAL LECTURE CANCELED

95
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:33,920
ERICA SHIN'S LECTURE HAS BEEN CANCELED

96
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:36,672
She missed her flight?
Then who's the Erica Shin we saw?

97
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,009
-Was that Sol?
-What?

98
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,513
You mean she disguised herself
as Erica Shin and…

99
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:45,848
No way. She fooled all of us?

100
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,433
I had no idea.

101
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:48,893
You too, right?

102
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,481
-What if Ko Hyeong-su didn't believe her?
-I'm sure he did.

103
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:54,607
She even fooled us.

104
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,776
You had no idea, right?

105
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:00,822
I was worried that weasel would catch on,
so I had to do a test run.

106
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,824
It was so nerve-racking.

107
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:06,619
There are no cabs here
because of the protest. Let's walk a bit.

108
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:07,537
I have to go.

109
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,579
Professor.

110
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:10,039
I'm starving.

111
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,167
Professor!

112
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:16,254
I did a good job, you know.

113
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:18,923
Can we grab a bite to eat?

114
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:22,009
I told you I never eat with my students…

115
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:23,970
I'm Kang Dan.

116
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,859
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

117
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:41,946
Search and seizure?

118
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,409
-What did you tell Prosecutor Lee--
-Not all prosecutors are like you.

119
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:49,078
Are you trying to get
Prosecutor Lee fired?

120
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,581
Can you afford to worry about him now?

121
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:55,168
I heard your number was found
on the burner phone they seized.

122
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:59,630
Please cooperate with the investigation.
I'm eating now. I have to go.

123
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:07,180
Can I just eat without this?

124
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,646
Want to hear about the best jjajangmyeon
I've ever had?

125
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:20,193
The jjajangmyeon I had in your office
when you were a prosecutor.

126
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:22,820
My gosh, it was so good.

127
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:26,365
I can't believe I was that hungry
after causing such trouble.

128
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,453
I have to say,
the portion here is quite small.

129
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:34,081
Maybe I should've ordered the jumbo size.

130
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,126
If you're done, let's get going.

131
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:46,552
You know, the law…

132
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,390
The law that I'm studying with you.

133
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:58,189
It'll punish Ko Hyeong-su
for what he did, right?

134
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,618
Are you telling me to destroy evidence?

135
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:17,041
There's no need to spell it out.

136
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:23,589
It's just that no one can drag us into it
without the burner phone.

137
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:27,385
Do whatever it takes to get rid of it.

138
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,223
We're in the same boat, you know?

139
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:36,644
Then you shouldn't have kept anything
from me--

140
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,563
I told you. I never meant to lie to you.

141
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:41,899
I just didn't tell you
because you didn't need to know.

142
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:45,403
At times like this,

143
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:48,573
you need to hang tight and help me out.

144
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,743
According to Jin,

145
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:55,496
he met Ko when he was stationed
in the National Assembly.

146
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,416
He admitted speaking to Ko on the phone
a few times recently.

147
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:02,837
But apparently, it was regarding
the constitutional review.

148
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,589
What do I say to that?

149
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:07,592
-They only talked? No text messages?
-No, just phone calls.

150
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:10,219
We had an analysis done
to see if anything was deleted,

151
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,387
but no text messages.

152
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,223
But according to the phone records,

153
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:17,602
he only used the burner phone to talk
to Choi Jae-cheol and Jin Hyeong-u.

154
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:18,853
He's hiding something.

155
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:21,439
That's enough
to make Prosecutor Jin feel cornered.

156
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:26,527
The fact that we caught Assemblyman Ko
talking to Choi Jae-cheol on the phone

157
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,030
can prove the interference with business

158
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,657
but not the incitement
to commit the murder,

159
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:35,077
which means we need Ki Du-seong
or Choi Jae-cheol's confession.

160
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,912
Ki will spill the truth soon.

161
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,716
You should tell the police
what you heard from Ki Du-seong

162
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,468
before he spills the truth.

163
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:57,433
Why take a risk? You know the police
searched and seized Ko's office.

164
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,394
The court won't support
Ki's self-defense argument.

165
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:01,812
And if that happens,

166
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:05,149
Ki certainly won't keep his mouth shut
for Ko. You know that.

167
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:15,117
It's time you let go of the rotten rope.

168
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,674
VOICE MEMO

169
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,768
Murder?

170
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,228
You really had no idea.

171
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:46,232
You would've been found dead in that room
had you known about it.

172
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:58,202
While investigating the suspicion
that Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su

173
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,830
had ordered Ki Du-seong to murder Yang,
a law professor,

174
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:01,914
we raided a site

175
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:05,626
where comments were being manipulated
systematically under his command,

176
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,046
so we got a warrant issued
and searched his office.

177
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,424
I have huge respect
for Prof. Yang and Prof. Kim.

178
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,843
Seriously, talk about perfect teamwork.

179
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,845
Prof. Kim, by publicly alleging facts.

180
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:19,265
Prof. Yang, by publicizing
the allegations. They got him good.

181
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:21,350
Wow, who knew this was their plan?

182
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:25,980
Yangcrates did this to make sure
they'd properly investigate Ko Hyeong-su.

183
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:27,773
Yes, people need to know

184
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:30,693
why the future presidential candidate
is being investigated.

185
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:33,737
Ko Hyeong-su proposed the bill
and toyed with us.

186
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:35,990
I bet he didn't see this coming.

187
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:37,825
He dug his own grave.

188
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:39,535
Don't be too excited.

189
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,621
We don't know who will be buried
in the grave that Ko has dug.

190
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,836
Despite the trouble that my son caused,

191
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:53,549
my approval rating
has been steadily going up,

192
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:57,052
and some people
are determined to bring me down.

193
00:11:57,136 --> 00:12:02,057
It is truly unfortunate that the police
and Professor Yang Jong-hoon

194
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:07,062
are letting those people use them
to get what they want.

195
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:09,523
Launching a counterattack
right after the briefing.

196
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,567
He wouldn't just sit back and do nothing.

197
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,903
But the fact that
the court issued the warrant

198
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:16,071
must mean there's substantial evidence.

199
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:17,573
Evidence, my foot.

200
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:20,784
The judge who issued the warrant.
Guess who his niece is.

201
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:22,703
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU
PRESS CONFERENCE

202
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:23,621
She is…

203
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:26,540
one of Yang Jong-hoon's students.

204
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,843
LETTER OF APOLOGY

205
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:39,762
So, after reading this letter,

206
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,972
you feel torn about whether to ask them

207
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:43,641
not to punish him?

208
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:49,146
He wrote this with his blood
and promised me that he won't do it again.

209
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,105
LETTER OF APOLOGY

210
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:53,234
"I should've been patient
even when you were getting on my nerves.

211
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:55,819
I'm really sorry
I lost my temper and hit you."

212
00:12:57,321 --> 00:13:00,574
This is not what I'd expect
from someone who's genuinely sorry.

213
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,952
He should not have hit you,
no matter what.

214
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:06,247
But if I never got on his nerves…

215
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:09,291
You said what got on his nerves
was the fact that

216
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,169
you kept the job
which he had told you to quit.

217
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,257
He didn't like that
the cafe was owned by a guy,

218
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:18,008
so he told me to quit.

219
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:21,637
But I needed the job.

220
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,681
That's not your fault, Seong-hui.

221
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:27,726
"I'll never hit you again,
no matter what you do."

222
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,228
This is like him saying,

223
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:33,399
"You're at fault, but I do apologize
for not being understanding enough."

224
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,902
"We should've both been careful."

225
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,488
I have no idea why you think
he actually feels bad.

226
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,323
I think he's practically saying

227
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:45,035
he'll keep hitting you
if you don't change your ways.

228
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,328
But…

229
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,248
he wrote this with his blood.

230
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,749
I interpret that as…

231
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,169
"Blood will be shed
if you don't listen to me.

232
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,548
I'll teach you a lesson."
This looks like a threat to me.

233
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,635
Then what do I do?

234
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:15,190
Seong-hui, you're not alone.

235
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:19,486
Let's find a way.

236
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:25,743
NOTICE BOARD

237
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:26,911
PRELIMINARY RESULTS

238
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,829
No!

239
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:31,916
What if we didn't pass
because of the draft I wrote?

240
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,335
I told you to revise the whole thing!

241
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,759
No! Don't show me.

242
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:44,803
-What? 351824! 351824, right?
-Yes!

243
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,096
Yes!

244
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,139
Congratulations!

245
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:48,641
Yours is 297632, right?

246
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:50,267
Yeah, do you see it?

247
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:51,810
Of course.

248
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,188
Nice! We're moving on to the semifinals!

249
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,523
See? I'm not a nuisance, right?

250
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:57,858
Let's check the question.

251
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,568
Right, for the semifinals.

252
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:00,903
Let's see.

253
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:02,446
MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION
SEMIFINALS

254
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,616
The charge is
"child abuse resulting in death."

255
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,326
Article 275? Then it's…

256
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,411
Death caused by abandonment.

257
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,873
"Neglected a 4-year-old
with a fever after the flu shot

258
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,375
which led to the kid's death."

259
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,253
We must submit the prosecutor's statement
and the summary of argument like before.

260
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,297
And our roles will be announced soon.

261
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:24,301
Okay. The leniency toward child abusers
always made me so angry.

262
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:26,971
All right, I'll be the prosecutor.

263
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:30,891
By the way, where did my roomie go?

264
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,103
Hey.

265
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:35,938
It just ended.

266
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,690
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

267
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:39,650
All right.

268
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:43,654
Your closing statement
asking for a strict punishment

269
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:44,947
was quite memorable.

270
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,659
It was more effective
than asking for leniency.

271
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,245
That's not what I was after.

272
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:53,872
If you get jail time,
you can't witness your kid's birth.

273
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:54,957
So I get it.

274
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,669
I'd be moved if I were the judge.

275
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:05,634
What if he gets jail time?

276
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:08,262
I can't believe
he asked for a strict punishment.

277
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:10,014
-He deserves jail time.
-Goodness.

278
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:12,683
Right.

279
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:17,146
He did a bad thing. I know it's bad,
but he doesn't have any priors.

280
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:20,482
Plus, we issued a permanent exclusion
so he couldn't reenter law school.

281
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:23,277
Why not use it as a mitigating factor
and ask for probation?

282
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,987
Do you have to think out loud?

283
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:31,368
Gosh, why can't I reach James?

284
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,037
It's been a while.

285
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,455
Since when?

286
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,915
Yes, I'm leaving now.

287
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,335
I'm headed to the airport now,
so keep an eye on him.

288
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,557
-What's going on?
-I'll get out and check.

289
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:56,769
Hey.

290
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,021
What do you want?

291
00:16:59,104 --> 00:16:59,938
Ko Hyeong-su,

292
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:03,358
you're under arrest for inciting murder
and online manipulation.

293
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:04,485
Under arrest?

294
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:06,153
You have the right to remain silent

295
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:08,363
-and the right to an attorney--
-Stop this now!

296
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:13,869
Why don't you sit back
and enjoy the smooth ride to the precinct?

297
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,329
Let's go.

298
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,752
How do you feel
to have passed the preliminaries?

299
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:25,339
That video got so many mean comments.
Do you still want to post a vlog?

300
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:28,133
You can't be a prosecutor
if you're that weak mentally.

301
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:29,927
Did you see the videos of the finals?

302
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,262
-What?
-I told you to watch all the videos.

303
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:33,889
Okay, I will.

304
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:37,017
We'll go watch all of them now. Let's go.

305
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,018
Come on.

306
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:40,562
-Hey.
-Stop it.

307
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:45,442
Why are you so determined to win?

308
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,320
I want to get
on the president's good side.

309
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:50,030
Sorry to disappoint you,

310
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,991
but they've never picked both winners
from the same school

311
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,201
in the previous years.

312
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,911
We'll be the first ones to do that.

313
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,788
Let's set a record.

314
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,250
I think it'll be hard because of Sol.

315
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:03,377
Right, it won't be easy.

316
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,837
It certainly won't be easy.

317
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,547
-What are you talking about?
-What?

318
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,591
I'm not done yet, but can you
go through what I've found so far?

319
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,301
On all the precedents and cases.

320
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:15,180
I watched the videos of the finals too.
Some were very impressive.

321
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:16,265
They were really good.

322
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:21,019
It won't be an easy fight,

323
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:24,898
but I don't want to hear you say we lost
because of me, so I'll do my very best.

324
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,026
It's surely not easy to set a record.

325
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:32,656
Ko Hyeong-su…

326
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,242
He just got arrested.

327
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:44,543
I asked you

328
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,755
to destroy evidence?

329
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:55,220
Can you stop recording for a second?

330
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:04,855
The burner phone isn't the only evidence
that needs to be destroyed.

331
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,890
I didn't think you'd stoop so low.

332
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,476
Jin Hyeong-u…

333
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,853
Solicitation of murder?
This is way out of line.

334
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:45,812
"Out of line"?

335
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,856
You're one to talk.

336
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:53,153
All I did was find a loophole that was
visible to anyone who knows the law well.

337
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,242
My specialty is turning a crisis

338
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,328
into an opportunity.

339
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,040
Do you think

340
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,127
I'll crumble down like this?

341
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:14,132
I've taken my hands off this.

342
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,844
I'll see whether or not you'll be indicted

343
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,888
as an outsider.

344
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:37,030
This is Lee Man-ho's son.

345
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,826
Why do you have this photo?

346
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:46,623
I don't know who left it in my office.

347
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,669
You should call your attorney.

348
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:51,962
Please…

349
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,423
The prosecution, not the defense team!

350
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:56,383
-Please…
-Be quiet, will you?

351
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:59,219
A, B
PROSECUTION, DEFENSE COUNSEL

352
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:00,721
-Defense counsel.
-What?

353
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,057
-You need to defend the accused.
-No.

354
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:06,101
I really wanted to be the prosecutor.

355
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:08,562
You're the one who picked this.

356
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:10,897
I should've picked better.
Why am I so unlucky?

357
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:13,442
You worked hard to draft up
the prosecutor's statement.

358
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:17,487
It's not about that.
I'd just feel more confident on that side.

359
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:20,365
You should feel confident on either side.

360
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,451
Did I beg to be on the defense team

361
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:24,786
just because I drafted up
the summary of argument?

362
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,704
Well, you're--

363
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:29,166
If you're going to be this annoying
and pathetic, just give up.

364
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,588
Give up what?

365
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:37,841
I was hoping to be on the other side
because I'd feel more confident.

366
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,801
Because you guys will do well either way.

367
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,597
What your roomie means is
we should do a good job no matter what.

368
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:45,390
-Gosh…
-We got it!

369
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:48,060
-Nice!
-Hey, we got it!

370
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:49,394
Nice!

371
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,230
I should do a good job no matter what.

372
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:53,982
Yes, I must.

373
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,486
I really need to do a good job this time.

374
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:01,948
Please give me a brilliant legal mind.

375
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:05,869
"Legal mind"?

376
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,622
There's no such thing.

377
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:11,124
It's a delusional belief
formed by privileged jurists.

378
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,042
Pardon?

379
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,337
Go read the law books
instead of wasting your time like this.

380
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,922
-Jeez.
-If you're going to whine,

381
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,090
do it elsewhere.

382
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,521
Wait, what you just said…

383
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:35,398
That means I can do it, right?

384
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:38,360
That face.

385
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:41,196
You want to tell me, "Sol, you can do it."
Right?

386
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:45,992
Thank you for your encouragement.
I'll do my very best, professor!

387
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,168
Yeah, I'm coming now.

388
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,461
You just wait.

389
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,760
For it to constitute as abandonment
resulting in death,

390
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:06,471
they must prove that
the kid was intentionally abandoned.

391
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:07,681
If we can disprove--

392
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:10,350
Your roomie will be here shortly.
Let's wait for her.

393
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:16,022
MOM

394
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:28,618
MOM

395
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:30,620
POWER OFF

396
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:54,102
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

397
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,020
Yes!

398
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,396
I got the closing argument.

399
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:06,489
Okay.

400
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:22,839
We should decide too.

401
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:26,051
The summary, the main argument,
the reargument, the closing argument.

402
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,094
Let's decide who will do what.

403
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,097
You guys pick first.
I'll take what's left over.

404
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,225
You can do anything?

405
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:37,103
I got the summary
and the closing argument.

406
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:39,773
The two of us will write the main one.
The reargument…

407
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:41,566
You can work on it by yourself.

408
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:46,112
As for the answers,
the two of us can work on them together.

409
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,159
Sounds good.

410
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:53,203
I'll struggle with the main argument
alone.

411
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:55,538
If you win the Excellence Award too--

412
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:56,831
That's my plan.

413
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:59,251
I should at least get that
if our team doesn't win.

414
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:10,637
I can't reach James.

415
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:14,099
I hope it has nothing to do with you, sir.

416
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:18,144
What are you talking about?

417
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:20,480
And he'd better be okay.

418
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:26,653
I'm the one who sent James to the US.

419
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,950
You seem very worried.

420
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:35,036
Should I ask around?

421
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,874
Then first, do me a favor…

422
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,460
I'll represent you, as you wanted.

423
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:44,212
What? You will?

424
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:45,380
Of course.

425
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,967
I knew I could count on you.

426
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,635
Why would you do that?

427
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,930
He needs me to represent him
to keep my lips sealed.

428
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:58,143
Now, I know even more about him
than I thought I did.

429
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:00,186
The duty of confidentiality.

430
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,732
Come on. You're hurting my feelings here.

431
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:07,527
I'm asking you because
you're the only person I can trust.

432
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,030
But you can't
because you're a law professor now.

433
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:11,948
Will you be his special defense counsel?

434
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:15,201
Then you'd have to be indicted first.

435
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:17,287
This young man here will do his best

436
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,873
to make sure you won't be indicted.

437
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,626
Me?

438
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:32,177
YOUR DONATION WILL BRING JUSTICE

439
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:43,938
YOUR DONATION WILL BRING JUSTICE

440
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:50,695
YOUR DONATION WILL BRING JUSTICE

441
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,331
Professor Seo

442
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:04,751
didn't want his name on it.

443
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:13,259
I insisted that we do it.

444
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:16,971
But things turned out this way.

445
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:22,227
Then what did

446
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:25,230
my uncle want?

447
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,109
"The law is not just."

448
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:34,239
I wanted to see that engraved on this.

449
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,451
That I certainly can't allow.

450
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,495
The law…

451
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,873
must be just.

452
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,753
After all,
that's why we built this mock court.

453
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:05,979
"The law…

454
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:08,982
is not just."

455
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:19,534
There's no such thing as the legal mind.

456
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,371
Kang Sol.

457
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:26,207
You worked so hard to come this far.

458
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,007
STOPWATCH

459
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,926
Here is the summary of the argument.

460
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,888
First, the defendant
never abandoned the child.

461
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,097
Abandonment is…

462
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:51,191
PLEASE RECYCLE

463
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:52,984
Want one?

464
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:01,451
Is it about Ko Hyeong-su's trial?

465
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:07,373
Our mock trial happens to fall
on the same day.

466
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,670
Knowing you, there's no way
you're nervous about the mock trial.

467
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:18,510
Are you thinking about your uncle?

468
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,183
Hey.

469
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,064
I'll be rooting for you
in your uncle's place.

470
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,193
I'll do the same.

471
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:36,986
No, thanks.

472
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:40,865
Someone's already rooting for me,
so I just need to do a good job.

473
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:42,826
Really?

474
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,954
Then let's see how good you are.

475
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:48,248
The victim is now deceased and can't talk.

476
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:51,376
The child would be alive
if she received treatment soon.

477
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:54,546
However, she was neglected all night
despite having a high fever

478
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:55,880
and eventually died.

479
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:01,678
You're a defense attorney.

PROSECUTION
DEFENSE COUNSEL

481
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:06,766
Neglecting a 4-year-old child

482
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,686
who was clearly exhibiting
side effects of the flu shot…

483
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:14,274
It is a clear case of child abandonment.

HANKUK UNIVERSITY OF KOREA

00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:20,738
Maintain emotional distance.

486
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:24,158
You're about to nod and say
you empathize with everything.

487
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:25,952
No, cut it out.

488
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:27,370
Do you want to sit over here?

489
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:30,039
No, I wasn't empathizing
with what you were saying.

PROSECUTION

491
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:35,336
The temperature wasn't too high
when she checked before going to work.

492
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,048
The flu shot can cause mild symptoms,
such as a slight fever.

493
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:45,638
I'm going to do a great job
in this mock trial.

494
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:47,682
Okay, go on then.

495
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:49,893
I will. Just go back to your seat.

496
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:52,562
Jeez.

497
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,189
The prosecutor insists

498
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:59,027
that the defendant's abandonment
of the victim resulted in her death.

499
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,155
But do you think that a mother,
who willingly abandoned her child,

500
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:05,658
would choose the type 4 vaccine
over type 3, which is free,

501
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:08,036
when she was struggling financially?

502
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:10,330
Good point.

503
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,581
ACCUSED

504
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:12,832
Go back to your seat.

505
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,796
It's rare to die
after getting the flu shot,

506
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:22,717
so even though the defendant
was worried about her child…

507
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,302
What? That was good, wasn't it?

508
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:26,512
Yeah, I don't need to play the prosecutor.

509
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:28,806
Let's go over the main argument.

510
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:38,066
Contrary to the prosecutor's argument,

511
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:39,525
the defendant chose…

00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,235
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

513
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,035
Here is the summary of the argument.

514
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:51,621
First, the defendant
never abandoned the child…

515
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:55,208
For this case to constitute
as abandonment resulting in death,

516
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,210
the prosecutor must prove that the victim…

but don't worry.

521
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:10,515
I'm working hard.

He just wrapped up Prof. Yang's case.

523
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:17,897

Prof. Yang told him to take this on.

524

Please be seated.

530
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,934
I would like to sit here
since I am the victim.

531
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:59,272
The prosecutor should take neither side
and must represent the common good,

532
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,524
so we should sit separately.

533
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:07,155
I will sit here

534
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:12,535
and observe the defendant
to see if he truly regrets his actions.

535
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,078
ACCUSED

536
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,503
JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION

537
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,556
Everyone looks so confident.

538
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,559
They'll think the same about us.
Don't be intimidated.

539
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,685
Don't be nervous.

540
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:39,062
We're in our 1L year.

541
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:41,064
I don't dream of moving on to the finals.

542
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:43,441
-This will be a good experience for us.
-Okay.

543
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,486
I wouldn't even be here
if I was going to be satisfied with this.

544
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:57,080
THE 9TH JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION

545
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:58,831
I'm Cho Ye-bum, on the same team.

546
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,001
I'm Min Bok-gi from Hankuk Law.

547
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:03,920
JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION

548
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,505
I'm Kang Sol B from Hankuk Law.

549
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:07,632
Witness.

550
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:13,012
Have you ever met Mr. Ko?

551
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:16,724
-I met Choi Jae--
-Yes or no?

552
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:20,144
No.

553
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:22,146
So you've never met him?

554
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,147
Correct, but--

555
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:26,234
Then why did you say
that Mr. Ko put you up to it?

556
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:27,527
Because Choi Jae-cheol--

557
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,696
Mr. Choi said he never mentioned
anything about Mr. Ko to you.

558
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:32,365
That bastard…

559
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:40,289
He said he'd get me out on parole

560
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:44,085
if I managed to quietly get rid of Yang.

561
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:46,838
But you…

562
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:50,133
You were my attorney.
How could you do this?

563
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,885
How much cash did that scumbag offer you?

564
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,011
No further questions.

565
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:57,515
You came to see me because you knew
he had ordered me to do it.

566
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:58,474
Be quiet.

567
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:01,769
-My gosh.
-You bastard.

568
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:02,812
Witness!

569
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:04,021
Your Honor.

570
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:07,817
This jerk is keeping his lips sealed
because he now represents him.

571
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,112
Witness, you must not speak
in this manner in the courtroom.

572
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:14,073
Stop using foul language.
Please speak in a calm manner.

573
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:17,618
WITNESS

574
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:19,704
Mr. Ki Du-seong said

575
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:21,831
the defendant had ordered him

576
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:26,252
to murder Professor Yang Jong-hoon
and Lee Man-ho through you.

577
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:27,587
Is that true?

578
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,005
No, that is not true.

579
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,092
I asked him to kill Lee Man-ho,
that piece of human trash.

580
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,760
As for that man,

581
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:38,097
Ki said he wanted to teach him a lesson
for putting him behind bars.

582
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:40,057
He did it of his own accord?

583
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,184
That's right.

584
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:43,895
And the comments?

585
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:47,481
When the bill
for the Lee Man-ho Act passed,

586
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:50,401
I became a huge fan of Assemblyman Ko.

587
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:53,487
So I started a secret fan club
and did it voluntarily.

588
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:57,450
Mr. Ko never incited you
to manipulate the comments?

589
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:58,367
Correct.

590
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,120
Assemblyman Ko knew nothing about the job.

591
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:05,249
"The job"?

592
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,755
No further questions.

593
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,173
WITNESS

594
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:14,342
Prosecutor,
please cross-examine the witness.

595
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,593
COURT

596
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,470
VICTIM

597
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,642
The "job" you mentioned.

598
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,145
Mr. Ko knew nothing about it?

599
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:30,816
Correct.

600
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:33,903
No further questions.

601
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:38,991
Your Honor.

602
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,454
I'd like to bring Erica Shin in
as a witness

603
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,206
to verify his claim.

604
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,335
-What?
-Erica Shin?

605
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:50,628
-What's going on?
-Erica?

606
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,671
-What?
-Who?

607
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:53,381
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

608
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,803
She's really here.

609
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,307
COURT

610
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,019
WITNESS

611
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:10,731
It's time you let go of the rotten rope.

612
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,362
So you're Erica Shin?

613
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,447
Let's meet as soon as you arrive in Korea.

614
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,866
I don't want to be associated with you
ever again.

615
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,038
Your sister and Yang Jong-hoon
keep getting on my nerves.

616
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:29,125
You know what happens
to those who try to mess with me.

617
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,544
I sure know all about the jobs.

618
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,255
Manipulating public opinion,
the witch hunts.

619
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,507
I ran away because I couldn't stand it.

620
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,384
That's nothing.

621
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:41,929
I can do worse things
if your sister keeps up her antics.

622
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,682
Has the job already begun?

623
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,561
If you want to put a stop to it,
meet me as soon as you arrive.

624
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:54,150
When did this phone conversation
take place?

625
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:58,529
I think it was after my sister
revealed my letter to Mr. Yang

626
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,573
on the Internet.

627
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:04,493
Your Honor.

628
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,873
First, please check
whether she really is Erica Shin.

629
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,499
What do you mean?

630
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,543
Everyone in this courtroom
is being fooled!

631
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:15,379
She is not Erica Shin.

632
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,091
She's Kang Sol, Erica Shin's twin sister!

633
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:20,009
-What?
-What?

634
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,218
Me?

635
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:48,037
VICTIM

636
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:49,997
I'm Kang Sol.

637
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:59,757
Your Honor.

638
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,052
Mr. Ko said
he could do "worse things" to me.

639
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:04,804
Could you ask him what he meant?

640
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:12,228
COURT

641
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:21,070
See that team over there?

642
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:24,615
They got a criminal case.
Last year, they nearly won.

643
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:25,825
They're very good.

644
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:31,580
This is an announcement.

645
00:39:31,664 --> 00:39:35,835
Dear participants of the mock trial
competition, please find your courtrooms.

646
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:40,631
Criminal teams to courtroom 11,
civil teams to courtroom 12.

647
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:44,218
Let me repeat the announcement.

648
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:48,848
Dear participants of the mock trial
competition, please find your courtrooms.

649
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:53,978
Criminal teams to courtroom 11,
civil teams to courtroom 12.

650
00:39:58,524 --> 00:39:59,400
Hold on.

651
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:00,776
What the…

652
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,155
-Wait, hold on.
-What the heck are you doing?

653
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,239
Please, let go…

654
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,075
What are you doing? Please stop.

655
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:13,622
I clearly warned you. No funny business.

656
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:14,874
That was a threat.

657
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,586
In any case,
I no longer have a reason to be afraid.

658
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,130
I found James.

659
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:26,010
Thank goodness you called me right away,
Prof. Kim. It would've been bad otherwise.

660
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,930
He's in the hospital at the moment.

661
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:33,017
You even solicited kidnapping
and confinement.

662
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,977
All kinds of solicitation charges.

663
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,729
It's time you paid for what you did.

664
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:40,316
-Sir.
-Let go of me!

665
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:43,486
Let go! Let go of me!

666
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,697
Let go! Let go of me, you jerks!

667
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,202
Let go, you bastards! Let go!

668
00:40:58,918 --> 00:41:00,836
I can't believe this day is finally here.

669
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,382
Thank you for allowing me
to work with you on this.

670
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,178
Ko Hyeong-su will contact you soon.

671
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,356
DEAR PROSECUTOR YANG JONG-HOON

672
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,776
Did you come straight here?
You should go home.

673
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:24,860
Prof. Yang.

674
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:27,071
Please say a few words.

675
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:29,365
Just a few words about the trial.

676
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:32,159
The court's decision
will tell you everything.

677
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:33,869
Is it true you brought Ko to trial

678
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:36,288
because of the mastermind
behind the whole thing?

679
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:37,414
"Mastermind"?

680
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:38,791
No, that is not true.

681
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:39,708
What?

682
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,336
The Yang Jong-hoon I know

683
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,130
would never let anyone use him
for political purposes.

684
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:49,134
I'd like to take this opportunity
to sincerely apologize to him

685
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:53,681
for the false accusation
caused by the prosecution's mistake.

686
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:57,059
There's a mastermind
behind this whole thing.

687
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,519
-What?
-Really?

688
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,853
-Who?
-Who is it?

689
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:01,272
-Tell us!
-Who is it?

690
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,523
-Tell us who it is!
-Wait!

691
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:03,691
-Who is it?
-Prof. Yang!

692
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,443
JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION
CRIMINAL TRIAL

693
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:08,612
Prosecution, thank you for your statement.

694
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:10,364
What do we do?

695
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,949
Just stick to the plan.

696
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,826
JUSTICE MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION

697
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:14,868
Defense counsel.

698
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:18,038
What do you think the key issues are?

699
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:19,206
But still…

700
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:21,834
State your main argument.

701
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,794
You have eight minutes.

702
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:29,258
Sure.

703
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,176
I will state our main argument.

704
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:35,723
First, the defendant
did not abandon the victim.

705
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,434
This cannot constitute
abandonment resulting in death

706
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:41,395
unless the defendant is guilty
of abandoning the victim,

707
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:44,690
whom the defendant had
a legal or contractual duty to protect.

708
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,443
Had she said no
when she got called into work

709
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:49,361
because she was worried about her child,

710
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:52,531
she probably would've been let go.

711
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:54,617
The company was trying to downsize.

712
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,578
Knowing that, she had to say yes
to support herself and her kid.

713
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:00,289
She had no choice.

714
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:04,335
-To emphasize that, Zumutbarkeit--
-The non-existence of Zumutbarkeit

715
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,462
can be used as a ground for excuse.

ZUMUTBARKEIT:
THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPECTING A LAWFUL ACT

717
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:10,382
Why bring this up now?

718
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,260
Gosh, why didn't I think of this?

719
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:15,596
We should've included this
in what we submitted.

720
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,807
Shouldn't we include it
in our oral argument?

721
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,559
Don't you know the rules?

722
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:24,063
We'll get penalty points
if we raise a new argument.

723
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:27,858
But we must defend the client.
Just because of the penalty points--

724
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,693
This is a competition.

725
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,445
Penalty points mean we won't win.

726
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:33,739
You suggested we do this
because of the award.

727
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:35,741
Right.

728
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,286
But we can't leave it out when we know--

729
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,540
But it's clearly against the rules,
which will put us at a disadvantage.

730
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:47,753
But we may not get a good score
if we're not putting the client first.

731
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,506
I think we should include it
in our argument--

732
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:52,800
This is a mock trial, not a real one.

733
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,803
The purpose of mock trials
is to help us in real ones.

734
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,514
If we're competent attorneys…

735
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,309

We still have some time left.

739
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:20,911
Is there something you'd like to add?

740
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,246
Yes.

CRIMINAL TRIAL

742
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,253
The Criminal Code
accepts extra-statutory excuses

743

based on the principle of Zumutbarkeit.

744
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:32,714
It means we can't hold someone

745
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:35,592
legally responsible
when there are reasonable grounds.

The defendant in this case
is the sole breadwinner for her family.

749
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:48,897
She couldn't say no
when she was forced to come into work

750
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:52,401
outside of her regular work hours
because she needed to keep the job.

751
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:53,444
Just a moment.

752
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:57,322
This argument was not included
in your preparatory documents.

753
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:00,701
That is correct.

754
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:04,955
But we wanted to bring it up
because it will help the defendant.

If our client must suffer the consequences
of our careless mistake,

760
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,810
we, as her defense attorneys,

761
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:29,521
should take responsibility
and accept the penalty.

00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:34,234

The plaintiff experienced
high levels of stress

765

due to the defendants'
intentional, unlawful acts to cause noise.

766
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,381
We request that

767
00:45:56,465 --> 00:46:00,093
the plaintiff receive a compensation
of 5 million won based on Article 750.

768
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:07,518
This should serve as a deterrent
to other child abuse cases.

769
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:09,686
We ask that the defendant be found guilty

770
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,690
for violating the Act on Special Cases
Concerning Punishment of Child Abuse

771
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,235
and that she be sentenced to three years.

772

Thank you for your closing argument.

773
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:22,658
He's very good.
Too bad they got the penalty points.

774
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,286

please share your closing argument.

775
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,459

00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:40,509
the defendant's abandonment of the victim
resulted in her death.

779
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:42,678
But it is not convincing enough.

780
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,389
Despite the prejudice
against single mothers,

781
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,975
-she did her best to raise her child.
-She did her best.

I know, but it won't hurt
to have it all memorized.

The defendant was worried about her child,

but she had to go to work
to support herself and her child…

You won't settle with Attorney Song
because of the constitutional appeal.

He said he'd make me a partner
at Hyeongseol if I helped him with it.

816
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:35,707
I'll give you the professor position
at the Legal Clinic.

No, thanks. It'll pay peanuts.

818

for handing over the bill
to abolish the law to Ko Hyeong-su.

Well, no more.

825
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:59,398
Why should I help Ko Hyeong-su
who uses the law for his own gain?

Let's tackle this together.

Because of your roommate--

856
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,108
I really didn't want to do it
because of you,

857
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,027
but my roommate convinced me to do it.

858
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,613
And it's not her fault that we lost.

00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:12,906

00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,627
Bottoms up.

862
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,854
You said "Sol" did a good job. Is that me?

863
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,193
It is me?

864
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,782
My gosh, I'm so happy right now.

865
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:58,368

-You need to give me credit for it.
-No.

875
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,520
You went overboard.

00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,815
I think I did a pretty good job.

00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,852
"Every new time will give its law."

884
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:08,021
Maxim Gorky.

885
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:10,231
"Law is an ethical minimum."

886
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:11,566
Georg Jellinek.

887
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:16,655
"The law destroys
those who do not fear it."

888
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:19,282
George Gordon Byron.

889
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,201
"We are not machines.

890
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:23,161
Abide by the Labor Standards Act."

891
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,080
Jeon Tae-il.

892
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:27,999
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

893
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,125
Hammurabi.

894
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:30,794
Doesn't count! You're out, Ji-ho.

895
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:31,795
Why?

896
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:35,298
Hammurabi, seriously? That's too easy.

897
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:37,092
What? This is not fair.

898
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:39,928
"Judge fairly…

899
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,390
and make sure no one suffers unjustly."

900
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:46,893
Seo…

901
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,855
Byung-ju.

902
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,560
1 YEAR LATER

903
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:31,062
The results of the constitutional review

904
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:34,733
requested by Head Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u

905
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:36,526
will be announced shortly.

906
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:41,031
Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u
requested the constitutional review,

907
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:44,117
arguing that
Article 126 of the Criminal Code

908
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,579
infringes the freedom of speech
and the public's right to know.

909
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:48,913
For the common good…

910
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,665
We'll finally find out the decision.

911
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:57,130
Even if it's declared constitutional
and the trial has to resume,

912
00:54:57,213 --> 00:54:59,090
I won't lose the trial--

913
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:00,842
But you lost the civil suit.

914
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,636
I went easy on you

915
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,015
to express my deepest condolences
on the passing of your father.

916
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,224
This will be different.

917
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:09,559
It won't be any different.

918
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:11,895
Because I won't go easy on you.

919
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,568
Shouldn't you resent Cho Tae-yeong
more than me?

920
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:24,616
Unlike you,
he does not represent the common good.

921
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,912
Represent the common good…

922
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:30,455
Fine.

923
00:55:31,247 --> 00:55:35,001
Then I shall do my duty
and catch Cho Tae-yeong for you.

924
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,672
In return, you'll file a petition
if the trial resumes. What do you say?

925
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:45,095
I'm giving you a chance
to grab the golden rope.

926
00:55:45,178 --> 00:55:46,096
"Golden rope"?

927
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:50,809
A bale of straw at the most.

928
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,818
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

929
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:01,778
A bale of straw?

930
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:08,243
That was cute.

931
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:22,173
Could you please make sure
my face doesn't look too big?

932
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,219
Ready, go.

933
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,055
Our students go through the inquiries

934
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:31,599
that we receive here
at the Legal Clinic Center

935
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:34,936
and assist the professor
who is here as an advisor.

936
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:37,105
In addition to offering
legal consultations…

937
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:39,816
I'm so glad to hear that
your surgery went well, ma'am.

938
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:41,609
It was all because of money.

939
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,946
I really wanted that jerk
to pay for what he did, but I couldn't.

940
00:56:48,741 --> 00:56:51,953
Gosh, it's tiring
to be the chief of the Legal Clinic.

941
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:54,998
Oh, dear. That interview was exhausting.

942
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,666
Don't cry.

943
00:56:56,749 --> 00:57:00,670
My professor will make your husband
fear the law.

944
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:06,676
What? Me? If she's submitted a request
not to punish him, it's game over.

945
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:08,428
We can still get him punished.

946
00:57:10,513 --> 00:57:12,140
For child abuse, not assault.

947
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:14,017
But he didn't hit the kid.

948
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,852
-Right, he didn't.
-So how?

949
00:57:16,686 --> 00:57:18,730
But the kid saw his dad hit his mom.

950
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:20,648
He's seen it many times, in fact.

951
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,402
It left a deep emotional scar on the kid.

952
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:26,905
And here's a precedent

953
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:28,990
where the perpetrator
of such emotional abuse

954
00:57:29,073 --> 00:57:30,408
was convicted of child abuse.

955
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:34,496
Now, I just want you to pass the bar exam
on the first try.

956
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,207
I should go study now.

957
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,334
Bye.

958
00:57:40,877 --> 00:57:43,463
My, she's good.

959
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:48,468
You know carbs make you sleepy.

960
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:52,847
You're in your 3L year.
Cut down on sleep before the bar exam.

961
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,308
Goodness. She's already sleep-deprived.

962
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:56,476
What if she fails?

963
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,687
-That will be so embarrassing--
-I won't fail the bar.

964
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:01,147
I suffer from insomnia.

965
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,400
Please prescribe some sleeping pills.

966
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:08,905
I think it'd be better to help you
beat insomnia without sleeping pills.

967
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:11,908
I noticed something important
while observing your conversation

968
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:13,993
and the way you interact with each other.

969
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:19,958
Ma'am, you still want to decide
what your daughter should eat.

970
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:24,837
And, Sol, instead of just saying
you want to eat bread,

971
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:28,466
you said, "I won't fail the bar exam,
so I can eat the bread."

972
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:33,179
It tells me you can't directly express
your needs and wants.

973
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:38,351
It reminds me of the way
little kids interact with their parents.

974
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:40,353
I think all three of you

975
00:58:40,436 --> 00:58:43,565
should try to become more mature
in your parent-child relationship

976
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:47,235
so you can be happier and freer.

977
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:54,576
Joon-hwi.

978
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:57,203
-Where are you going?
-I need to wind down.

979
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,588
You wanted to wind down.

980
00:59:09,173 --> 00:59:11,009
Yeah, while watching the trial.

981
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:12,010
ADMIN OFFICE

982
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:15,054
Right.

983
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:18,349
I've been too busy studying
that I didn't have time to come here.

984
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:21,269
Well, I should wind down a little too.

985
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:28,026
Your Honor, please have mercy on me.

986
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:30,903
If my house goes to auction,

987
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:33,406
my grandson and I

988
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,993
will become homeless.

989
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:41,164
Are you willing to settle the case?

990
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:42,915
The defendant seems to be in a bind.

991
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:44,876
No, Your Honor.

992
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,294
Please announce the decision.

993
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:49,589
Please have mercy on me.

994
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,675
I'll die soon anyway,

995
00:59:53,926 --> 00:59:56,846
but my poor grandson…

996
00:59:57,555 --> 01:00:01,768
We can't help you
if you just keep asking for mercy.

997
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:03,478
Defendant.

998
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:05,647
Instead of struggling alone,

999
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,650
I suggest you ask an attorney
to go through the documents.

1000
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:10,860
Your Honor.

1001
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:16,199
I think he needs some time
to regain his composure.

1002
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:17,533
Can we take a recess?

1003
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,124
Seun Savings, the plaintiff,
loaned 20 million won to your son,

1004
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:27,293
and you stood surety for him.

1005
01:00:28,002 --> 01:00:28,920
Yes.

1006
01:00:29,003 --> 01:00:33,216
Seun Savings loaned him the money
six years ago.

1007
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,719
He died in a car accident
five years and four months ago

1008
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,262
while just paying the interest.

1009
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:40,848
And the interest grew larger
than the principal,

1010
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:43,184
so the total amount
is now over 50 million won.

1011
01:00:43,267 --> 01:00:44,435
Right.

1012
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,148
The plaintiff is asking for the money back
after keeping quiet all these years.

1013
01:00:50,525 --> 01:00:53,528
Begging the judge in tears
won't solve the problem.

1014
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,280
When the trial resumes,

1015
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:59,158
just say this one thing to the judge.

1016
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:00,493
Pardon me?

1017
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:01,994
Please repeat after me.

1018
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,372
The statute of limitations…

1019
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:07,500
The statute of limitations…

1020
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,420
on the loan has already expired.

1021
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:14,424
on the loan has already expired.

1022
01:01:17,009 --> 01:01:18,386
I have the draft ready.

1023
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:22,223
This loan is considered commercial debt.

1024
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:25,643
So, as of November 26th, 2021, the date
the plaintiff filed the complaint,

1025
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:29,480
the statute of limitations of five years
on this loan

1026
01:01:29,564 --> 01:01:31,357
has already expired.

1027
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:34,152
Ergo, the plaintiff's request
should be denied.

1028
01:01:35,027 --> 01:01:37,864
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

1029
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:41,617
Why are you here?

1030
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:46,330
Was that a gift?

1031
01:01:48,624 --> 01:01:51,461
Are you still going on
about the lot I gave to Byung-ju?

1032
01:01:53,045 --> 01:01:56,382
You want to hear me say
that it was a bribe?

1033
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:01,679
What will change if I admit to it now?

1034
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:05,224
Prohibition against double jeopardy,
you know?

1035
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:11,773
It'll only make you beat yourself up more
for failing to solve it.

1036
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:49,143
It was a bribe, wasn't it?

1037
01:02:52,313 --> 01:02:54,065
I showed everyone that…

1038
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:57,777
the law is not just.

1039
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:02,490
That I was wrong.

1040
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:15,920
What will change if I admit to it now?

1041
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,676
It'll only make you beat yourself up more
for failing to solve it.

1042
01:03:24,804 --> 01:03:27,014
Because I have students

1043
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:29,517
who learn from it…

1044
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:29,577
I'm Yang Jong-hoon,
your criminal law professor.

1045
01:04:32,163 --> 01:04:37,919
A FEW YEARS LATER

1046
01:04:42,214 --> 01:04:45,092
KANG SOL
ATTORNEY AT LAW

1047
01:04:49,597 --> 01:04:53,935
Just bring these documents next time,

1048
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:56,020
and I'll go over them for you.

1049
01:04:56,103 --> 01:04:57,688
LAW OFFICE KANG &amp; PARK

1050
01:04:59,148 --> 01:05:01,233
I'm sorry. Something's come up.

1051
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:05,029
As Mr. Park helped you originally,
he'll do the rest for you.

1052
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:08,157
Mr. Park, can you take care of the rest?

1053
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:10,076
Sure.

1054
01:05:14,455 --> 01:05:17,959
How can I help you…

1055
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,884
PROSECUTOR HAN JOON-HWI

1056
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:54,787
The law is imperfect justice.

1057
01:05:56,998 --> 01:06:01,252
But when you teach law,

is the most cruel violence.
