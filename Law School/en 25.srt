16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,479
Mr. Pan, for the details of
our cooperation,

17
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,160
I will ask Manager Xie

18
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,240
to email you by then.

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,559
Mr. Lin is really a quick doer.

20
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,679
Having your words, I feel relieved now.

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,960
I heard before that Mr. Lei from Yutian
is a very able man.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
But I didn't know that
there is always someone better,

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,360
until I met Mr. Lin today.

24
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,279
You're flattering me!

25
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,320
Happy cooperation!

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
OK. Happy cooperation!

27
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,119
OK.

28
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,279
Come with me, please.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,119
Xiangyuan?

30
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,440
Are you Lin Xiangyuan?

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
Who are you?

32
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,839
You didn't recognize me?

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,320
I can tell now.

34
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,039
Who am I?

35
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,720
Mengnan, Li Mengnan!

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,399
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,160
What brings you to shanghai?

38
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm here for business.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,639
Come, come, come!
I'll take you out to dinner!

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,559
OK.

41
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,440
I haven't put my suitcase down yet.

42
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,000
Mrs. Fanlv, when I was doing laundry,

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,039
I found this in Mr. Lin's pocket,

44
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,559
wondering if Mr. Lin still needs it.

45
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,519

47
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,440
Not bad.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
This is my husband.
A technician from IT field.

49
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,240
When I arrived in Tianjin,

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
he started going after me.

51
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,399
Next to him is my son.

52
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,320
He is five years old
and his name is Dudu.

53
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:11,679
You're so happy. Such a perfect match!

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,279
And you also have a lovely son.

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,399
No need to be envied.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Didn't you get married
and have children?

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
Xiangyuan.

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,079
Xiangyuan,
you are asked to send some photos.

59
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,559
Your wife's photos.

60
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,279
What happened?

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,040
You are not married?

62
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,600
My wife is from Shanghai
and her surname is Jiang.

63
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,799
She is just pregnant.

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,799
Her dad and I work in the same company.

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,279
He is the chairman of the company.

66
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,040
Chairman?

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
Until now, I just figured out that

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,720
you're working for your father-in-law.

69
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:52,079
Well, not bad, Lin Xiangyuan.

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,279
Not only earning money from Shanghai,

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,279
and even married with
a wealthy fair belle from Shanghai.

72
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,200
We are really proud of you!

73
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,480
OK, let's not talk about this.

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,799
How long are you planning to
stay in Shanghai this time?

75
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,640
How about I take you around in Shanghai?

76
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,880
If you need any help in Shanghai,

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,519
just feel free to let me know.

78
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,440
Well, I really need your help now.

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
This time, I came to
Shanghai from Tianjin

80
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,079
for business.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,480
But I don't know their boss very well.

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,399
So, I want you to go with me and
give me some advice.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,239
OK, no problem.

84
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,959
It's my pleasure.

85
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,200
-Thank you.
-Cheers!

86
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,799
This way, please.

87
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,119
OK, thank you.

88
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,279
Please wait here,

89
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,799
and our president will come very soon.

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,760
OK, thanks.

91
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,340
(In the Meeting. Keep Quiet)

92
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,480
Mr. Shangguan, I'm Li Mengnan.

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,359
Nice to meet you.

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,600
We talked before over the phone.

95
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,480
Nice to meet you, Ms. Li.

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,519
Nice to meet you.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,040
Sorry, this is?

98
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
This is my friend, Lin Xiangyuan.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,920
He is the president of Yutian Group.

100
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,399
Oh, Mr. Shangguan.

101
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,640
You are a big shot and
I guess you wouldn't mind

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,160
I bring my friend here

103
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,279
to give some advice.

104
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,200
President of Yutian Group.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,519
He should be the big shot here.

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,679
He's more than welcome to be here.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
Right, Mr. Lin?

108
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,480
Nice to meet you.

109
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,880
Nice to meet you.

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,679
Then, let's start now.

111
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,920
Please introduce the project, Ms. Li.

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,320
Sure.

113
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,679
(Slow Enough, Beautiful Enough)

114
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,399
Siqi, why are you still there?

115
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm waiting for Shangguan
to pick me up.

116
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,920
You go first.

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,000
Will Shangguan drive Mercedes

118
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,160
or Land Rover today?

119
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,760
You are out of date.

120
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,279
I saw it last time.

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
Shangguan just changed to a new Volvo,

122
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,959
and took Siqi out for a drive!

123
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,160
Really?

124
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,119
Volvo?
(Home Magazine)

125
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,799
I've never been in a Volvo.

126
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,399
Maybe I was wrong.

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,079
I just saw a woman on passenger seat,

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,399
also with short hair.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,559
The car was very fast.

130
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,279
I thought it was you.

131
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,760
Well, I'm leaving now.

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
Bye.

133
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,399
Bye, Siqi.

134
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,480
This idea is ultramodern.
(Zou Siqi)

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,320
Glass curtain wall with the steel frame
structure as the main structure

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,559
coupled with the curved and
variable bending shape,

137
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,839
undoubtedly adds a strong modern style

138
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,839
to the entire Shanghai architecture.

139
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,000
Taking the advantage of Huangpu River,

140
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,880
geography and shape,

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,920
the building will
leave a very strong stroke.

142
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,679
Mr. Shangguan.

143
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,559
Mr. Shangguan?

144
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
What do you think?

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
You're done?

146
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,359
I think this project is very good.

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,799
Personally, I'm very satisfied with it.

148
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,920
But I have a little question.

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,959
During our cooperation this time,

150
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,079
will Mr. Lin join in?

151
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,440
To tell you the truth,

152
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,320
Xiangyuan is really a business expert.

153
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,160
I'm about to invite him to our project

154
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,719
and give some advice.

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
Really?

156
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,359
Yes.

157
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,520
That's great!

158
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,719
But... if this is the case,

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,719
I have to reconsider

160
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,359
the cooperation between us.

161
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,039
What do you mean?

162
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,799
Lin Xiangyuan, Mr. Lin,

163
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
I've heard of his name for a long time.

164
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
In the beginning,

165
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,000
he was sent by Boyuan Company to
Yutian as an outside help.

166
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,159
But during that period of time,

167
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
he replaced Lei Yuzheng.

168
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,080
And by pestering again and again,

169
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,679
he finally got Miss Jiang.

170
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,679
In the end,
he suddenly changed his identity

171
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,599
to the president of Yutian.

172
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,799
Such scheming mind and means

173
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,400
are really admirable.

174
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,960
Mr. Lin, how did you make it?

175
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,320
Teach me.

176
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,559
So, Ms. Li,

177
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,239
if Mr. Lin is also involved

178
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,080
in this project,

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,479
in the end, I may be
kicked out unconsciously

180
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,960
as well.

181
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,719
Who am I going to cry to by then?

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,840
Ms. Li,

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,119
you have to be responsible to me then.

184
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,440
Excuse me,

185
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,840
Lei Yuzheng?

186
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,840
Who is Lei Yuzheng?

187
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,359
I didn't get you.

188
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,719
Shangguan,

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,640
don't get other people
involved in our feud.

190
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
I can promise you that

191
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,799
I won't interfere in this cooperation,

192
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,080
if you cooperate with Mengnan.

193
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,400
Now, you start being
kind and nice to friends.

194
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,919
But it's a pity.

195
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,679
I know what kind of person you are.

196
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,280
I knew it long time ago.

197
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,520
Ms. Li,

198
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
I can't trust this person

199
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,200
and I also advise you
to stay away from him.

200
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,880
Be careful. Otherwise,
you may be betrayed someday

201
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,960
and won't even be aware of that.

202
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,359
Mr. Shangguan,

203
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,880
if you do not have confidence
in our cooperation,

204
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,440
Wenxing won't force it.

205
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
But,

206
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,880
please respect my friend.

207
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Thank you.

208
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,640
Xiangyuan, let's go.

209
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,559
Bye and take care.

210
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,359
Xiangyuan,

211
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,440
why did Shangguan Boyao
judge you in that way?

212
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,679
Who is Lei Yuzheng?

213
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,400
Mengnan,

214
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,280
I haven't had the time to tell you.

215
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,520
Lei Yuzheng is the former president
of our company.

216
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,359
Because of a case,

217
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,919
he is in jail now.

218
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,200
At that time, the company was a mess.

219
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,479
I was entrusted at that time,

220
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,080
and became the president of the company.

221
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,799
Shangguan and Lei Yuzheng
grow up together.

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,719
He thinks I robbed
Lei Yuzheng's position.

223
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,520
So, no matter what I explained,
he still doesn't buy it.

224
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,000
He is too bully!

225
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,479
Lei Yuzheng went to prison.

226
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
You became the president instead of him.

227
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,440
That is because you have the ability.

228
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,000
Mengnan,

229
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm sorry to let you
come here for nothing.

230
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,479
Why not you give me
your project proposal?

231
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,880
I'll help you figure out a solution.

232
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,479
I have said it's fine.

233
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,080
Don't be so fussy.
What are you doing as a big man?

234
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,559
OK.

235
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,239
How about this?

236
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,880
You take me around in Shanghai

237
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,479
these two days,

238
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,840
since now I have nothing to worry about.

239
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,400
Sure.

240
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,599
Let's go!

241
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,419
(Zou Siqi)

242
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,719
Hello. What do you mean?

243
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,479
Why didn't you call me the whole day?

244
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm sorry, Siqi. I'm very busy today.

245
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:41,880
Again? Are you too busy
to even make a call?

246
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
Shangguan.

247
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,000
Hang up?

248
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,840
I'm here today to tell you that

249
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,679
I helped you out!

250
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
What happened?

251
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,400
The story goes like this.

252
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,359
There is a lady,
who looks pretty by the way.

253
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,159
She wants to cooperate with our company.

254
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
But she came with Lin Xiangyuan.

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Guess what?

256
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,320
Can I pass up such an opportunity?

257
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,119
Right in front of this lady,

258
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,559
I gave Lin Xiangyuan a horrible meal.

259
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,400
In the end, I decided to
terminate the cooperation.

260
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,119
She has no rancor against you.

261
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,359
Why did you do that?

262
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,359
Because she is a friend
of Lin Xiangyuan.

263
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,760
How unlucky she is!

264
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,000
Buddy, after all,

265
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,640
what I can make now
is only small troubles

266
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,039
I'm waiting for the day you come out.

267
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,919
Let's do something big.

268
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,239
Let's do something big.

269
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,679
Stop it.

270
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,679
Don't say that again in the future.

271
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm now a prisoner

272
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,200
and have no plan for the future.

273
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,640
And Shangguan,

274
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,479
here is not a good place,

275
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,599
don't come to see me
in the future anymore.

276
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:13,159
When I'm out, let's get together.
I'm leaving now.

277
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,520
Buddy.

278
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
Go.

279
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,400
Go back.

280
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,440
Go back.

281
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,239
Xiangyuan, thank you these days

282
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,039
for taking me around.
It must waste you a lot of time.

283
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,080
In fact,

284
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,679
I should thank you.

285
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,280
I have been working in Shanghai
for such a long time

286
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,640
and these days are
the happiest and most relaxed moments.

287
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
If it wasn't because of you,

288
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,080
I have almost forgotten
what smile should be like.

289
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,159
Xiangyuan, in fact, there's a question

290
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,440
I always wanted to ask you.

291
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,880
How are you doing in Shanghai?

292
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,719
Mengnan, I remember

293
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,479
we met each other
in a townsmen gathering.

294
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,440
I remember that day
we talked until very late.

295
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,080
You said that, after you graduate,

296
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,719
you want to get married
and become a mom.

297
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,840
You want a family.

298
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,359
I said I must stay in Shanghai
after I graduate and

299
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,679
work in the best office building.

300
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,679
I must be a successful person

301
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,039
and have the best things in the world.

302
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,080
Then...

303
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,719
Then marry your most favorite lady.

304
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,159
Actually, I still remember

305
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,880
the way you said that.

306
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,599
There was light in your eyes.

307
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,799
Since then,

308
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,880
Xiangyuan,

309
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,520
I have been having the faith that
you will definitely be successful.

310
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,440
Mengnan, I want to ask you.

311
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,880
What is success?

312
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,799
Look at me now.

313
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,599
I am rich. I have a nice car,
a nice apartment,

314
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,039
and a rich wife.

315
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,119
These are what other people dream of.

316
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,119
But to be honest,

317
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm not happy at all now.

318
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,679
Sometimes, when I stay with her,

319
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,200
we even have no common topic.

320
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,960
I also feel pretty boring.

321
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,840
But now, we are going to have a baby.

322
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,880
There is hope in life.

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,359
Then life has to go on.

324
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,960
Xiangyuan, do you know

325
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,080
what is the most terrible thing?

326
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,919
That is to keep looking  back

327
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,960
when moving forward.

328
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,599
OK, let's drop it.

329
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,679
Just let bygones be bygones.

330
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,559
Everything will get better.

331
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,800
Let's sit here.

332
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,319
It's really tiring
after shopping for a whole day.

333
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,839
Fanlv, you are pregnant now.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,239
Still going out with us?

335
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,560
Your husband didn't stop you?

336
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,520
Did he? He treasures you so much.

337
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,760
If Lin Xiangyuan blames us,

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,439
you have to speak for us.

339
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,079
Can he control me?

340
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,439
Why hasn't Shasha come yet?

341
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,239
She leaves us alone again?

342
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,719
Let me call her.

343
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,119
It's late. Let me send you back.

344
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,160
Let's go.

345
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,079
Wait a minute.

346
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,199
What happened?

347
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,959
Sands are in my eyes.

348
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,359
Look!

349
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,680
Check out who that is?

350
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,199
No way!

351
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,359
It is really him.

352
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,680
What are you looking at?

353
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,239
Nothing. The environment
is quite nice here.

354
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,439
Really?

355
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,079
Why didn't I notice?

356
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,920
It's pretty good, very affectionate.

357
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,040
Fanlv, still awake?

358
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
Aren't you the same?

359
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,959
Still be out there messing
around in the midnight.

360
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,280
Who is messing around?

361
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,280
A work meal and I was held back.

362
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,599
At this moment,

363
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,959
you're still trying to cheat?

364
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,520
Opening a room in a hotel
during the Spring Festival.

365
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,079
Not bad, huh?

366
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,959
You asked me to go home with you
so eagerly for the Spring Festival.

367
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,359
I thought how filial you are.

368
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,079
You are really good!

369
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,959
No, I didn't go home
during the Spring Festival

370
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,040
and opened a room in a hotel.

371
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
I can explain.

372
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,160
Explain what?

373
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,880
Stop pretending!

374
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,319
I saw it clearly this afternoon.

375
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,040
In broad daylight,

376
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,000
you were with a lady and
had very close physical touch.

377
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,040
I cannot imagine

378
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,959
how many shameful things
you have done in private.

379
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,560
You mean Li Mengnan?

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,640
Please speak with respect.

381
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,079
Angry now?

382
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,880
Are you serious to that home-wrecker?

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,319
Could you just stop it?

384
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,599
It's really a shame!

385
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,199
Dad, he did this to me.

386
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,680
We are done.

387
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,760
What did I do? That's my fellow.

388
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,560
You can embarrass me deliberately.

389
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,760
You can also pour dirty water on me.

390
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,400
But please don't insult my friend, OK?

391
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Your friend?

392
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,640
So affectionate.

393
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,719
Lin Xiangyuan, if you are a man,

394
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,319
stop taking advantages of both sides.

395
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,319
You can't have your cake and eat it.

396
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,560
Enough!

397
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,520
Does that sound good to you?

398
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,640
What happened?

399
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,040
Have you been unfaithful to her?

400
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,119
Dad, Li Mengnan came to Shanghai
for business.

401
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,719
As a fellow and a host,

402
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,880
I just accompanied her around.

403
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,640
Do you think I believe you?

404
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,000
That's right.
I don't need to explain at all.

405
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,040
Because even if I explained,
you won't listen.

406
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,880
From the day we got married,

407
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,280
have you treated me well?

408
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,239
Have you ever regarded me
as your husband?

409
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,920
Jiang Fanlv,

410
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,439
don't you wish I had
some affairs outside,

411
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,719
so that you can directly

412
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,359
divorce with me?

413
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,959
Dad, I don't mind how Fanlv
is usually wayward,

414
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,920
and how she loses her temper.

415
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,439
I can try my best to bear all.

416
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,719
But she cannot just fabricate this

417
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,160
to force me to divorce.

418
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,239
Nor can she make fun of my friend.

419
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,199
My friend is innocent.

420
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:20,199
You have to be fair.

421
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,599
Fanlv,

422
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,719
Xiangyuan is not unreasonable.

423
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,880
How about you both calm down first?

424
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,839
Fanlv,

425
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:50,599
did you really misunderstand him?

426
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:09,248
(Eight Months Later)

427
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,560
Lei Yuzheng.

428
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,560
Come out and go through
procedures with me.

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,119
Congratulations, buddy.

430
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,760
Free again.

431
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,640
Yes, free again.

432
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,319
I've never expected

433
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,040
"freedom" can be

434
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,439
so luxurious like now.

435
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,119
Well, you don't want to leave?

436
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,000
To some extent, you are right.
Yes, kind of.

437
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,000
Suddenly free again.

438
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,319
In the rest of my life,

439
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,560
I will never forget this place.

440
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,599
No matter what,

441
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:09,400
this is just a place you stopped by.

442
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,719
You can take it as a suffering,

443
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,800
or a practice.

444
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,959
But no matter how you take it,

445
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,319
when the time comes, you have to leave.

446
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,079
Move forward.

447
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,439
Money Game.

448
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,280
Bye.

449
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,439
Take care.

450
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,199
Remember,

451
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,959
after you go outside that door,
don't look back.

452
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,680
Live a good life after going out.

453
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,959
When you have any difficulties,
just call me.

454
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,719
The door here

455
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,400
is always open.

456
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,719
But hope you'll never come back.

457
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,199
Thank you, Officer Liang.

458
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,479
You're welcome. This is my job.

459
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,400
Didn't you inform your family?

460
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:52,439
No, it's not a glorious thing.

461
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
I didn't tell them.

462
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,959
Let bygones be bygones.

463
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,119
Don't think too much.

464
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
There are still more days to come.

465
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,400
Here. Just go.

466
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,760
This place is a bit remote.

467
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,359
If you don't leave now,
you will miss the bus.

468
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,520
Bon voyage.

469
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,319
Goodbye.

470
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,696
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

471
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
Who is this?

472
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,160
Didn't recognize her?

473
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:49,920
Wanhua.

474
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:50,920
Wanhua.

475
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,119
Yes, it's her, Wanhua.

476
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,839
Yuzheng is not at home.

477
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,719
But where did Wanhua go?

478
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,359
She also went abroad.

479
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,880
She's worried about Yuzheng.

480
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,520
So, she went with him.

481
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,479
Go to the door to check

482
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,000
if they have come back.

483
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,040
There are so many things that
haven't been done abroad.

484
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,280
They will be back
after they finish them.

485
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,560
No, you have to go and check.

486
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,319
Maybe they're back now.

487
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,920
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

488
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
OK, then.

489
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,520
I will go to check.

490
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,560
Hurry up.

491
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,920
Stay here.

492
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,479
I'll be right back.

493
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:39,119
He's back. He's back.

494
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,719
Yuzheng,

495
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,239
you are back.

496
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,839
This is really magical.

497
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,479
Mr. Lei asked me to check the door

498
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,439
just at the right time,

499
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,040
neither too early nor too late.

500
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:23,359
If it is not the telepathy
between a father and a son,

501
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
what else it could be?

502
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,239
Kid, you're back!

503
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,520
Uncle Duan misses you so much!

504
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,439
Uncle Duan, where's my dad?

505
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,839
Mr. Lei!

506
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,560
Mr. Lei, check out who is back?

507
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,079
Yuzheng is back.

508
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,280
Dad,

509
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
I am back.

510
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,359
Dad.

511
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,839
You're back?

512
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,040
You finished all matters abroad?

513
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,599
It's all done, dad.

514
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:15,599
Mr. Lei.

515
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,680
Dad.

516
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,839
It's OK. It's so far away.

517
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,079
Are you hungry?

518
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,359
Yuzheng is hungry.
Start the meal, Duan.

519
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,719
OK, start the meal now.

520
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,160
Let's open a bottle of red wine.

521
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,359
Let's celebrate.

522
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,040
And Yuzheng's favorite, crystal shrimp.

523
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,479
I am going to prepare now.

524
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,800
Great.

525
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,119
About that matter,

526
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,640
although dad is willing to believe you,

527
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,959
ins and outs,

528
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,319
you have to make it clear as well.

529
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,680
You said that you went home
for the Spring Festival,

530
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,479
but it turned out that,

531
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:10,000
you were in a hotel room.

532
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,040
No wonder Fanlv doubted.

533
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,479
Dad, I was planning to.

534
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,040
I already drove to the airport.

535
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,119
My mom called and scolded me,

536
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,439
saying that I had to take my wife home,

537
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,040
or I couldn't go home.

538
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,959
I was also very embarrassed.

539
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,439
If I went back, how could I
explain to my mom?

540
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,439
If I stayed in Shanghai,
how could I face Fanlv?

541
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,640
I really had no good idea in the end.

542
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,119
So, I opened a room in a hotel

543
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,920
to calm myself down.

544
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,040
As for Li Mengnan,

545
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,040
Jiang Fanlv was catching at shadows.

546
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:06,839
For this matter, I'm all to be blamed.

547
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,920
For the Spring Festival,

548
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,439
your mom wants a family reunion.

549
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,400
This is human nature.

550
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,160
But Fanlv

551
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,800
was spoiled since she was a kid.

552
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,560
She didn't want to go back with you,

553
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,239
and I could do nothing about it.

554
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,239
But we ignored your feelings,

555
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:33,760
and hurt you.

556
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,680
But when there is a problem,
we should solve it together.

557
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,400
Not like you and Fanlv.

558
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,640
You clamored to get a divorce,
whenever something happened.

559
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,160
This will only hurt your relationship.

560
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,239
Am I right?

561
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,439
Dad, I didn't demand a divorce.

562
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,839
I want to live a good life.

563
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,599
But Fanlv doesn't give me the chance.

564
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,400
I really can't do anything about it.

565
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,239
Don't worry.

566
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,839
Although Fanlv is wayward,

567
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:08,560
she is not bad in nature.

568
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,079
Find a chance to explain to her,

569
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,319
and she can figure it out naturally.

570
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,319
As for your mom,

571
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,000
when it gets warmer,

572
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,079
bring her to Shanghai.

573
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,640
She raised you up alone

574
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,839
and suffered a lot.

575
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,880
You and Fanlv should do your best
to take care of her.

576
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,439
As for Fanlv,

577
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,079
ask her to apologize to
your mother sincerely.

578
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,520
Xiangyuan, just do me a favor.

579
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,719
Dad,

580
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,599
I am sorry.

581
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm the one who had you suffer.

582
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,199
I will take care of you from now on.

583
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,640
Why should you take care of me?

584
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:14,400
I am very well. You don't need to.

585
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,839
Work harder.

586
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,520
Yutian is such a big company.
Don't you need to take care of it?

587
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,959
My son can tell jokes now.

588
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:27,880
You take care of me?
Am I a three-year-old kid?

589
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:31,640
Eat, eat.

590
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,280
Dad.

591
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,599
Come, let's wash feet.

592
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,800
Hot?

593
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,239
Dad,

594
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,439
I won't go anywhere anymore.

595
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,679
I'll stay at home with you.

596
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,679
When I was little,
you took care of me.

597
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,280
Now, I should take care of you.

598
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,560
What happened?

599
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,879
You are not my son. Who are you?

600
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,399
Dad, I am Yuzheng.

601
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,360
No, you're not Yuzheng.

602
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,360
You don't look like my son at all.

603
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,439
This is when I was a kid.

604
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,159
I'm grown up now

605
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,280
and look different from before.

606
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,159
No, you're not Yuzheng.

607
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,879
You must be a liar, a liar.

608
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,159
You are a liar, a liar.

609
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,439
Dad.

610
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,199
You said that, when I was young,

611
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,679
my nose looked exactly like yours.

612
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,639
You can touch and feel.

613
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,360
Just touch it.

614
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,639
There are so many noses
that look similar.

615
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,320
Dad.

616
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,959
Drive away the liar.

617
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,280
Mr. Lei.

618
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,320
What's wrong, Yuzheng?

619
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,479
Uncle Duan,

620
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,520
my dad suddenly doesn't recognize me.

621
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,679
Mr. Lei, why are you confused?

622
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
You look forward to seeing your son
every day.

623
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,320
Yuzheng is back now.

624
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,479
He is standing in front of you.

625
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,399
Why can't you recognize him?

626
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,719
Nonsense.

627
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,679
He is not Yuzheng.

628
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,479
How come…

629
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,040
Definitely not. He is a liar.

630
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,399
You drive him away.

631
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,600
Dad,

632
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,840
I know I did something wrong.

633
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,399
I'm the one who had you suffer.
I'm the one who destroyed Yutian.

634
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,159
You can beat me and scold me,
and I won't have any complaints.

635
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,080
But, please don't disown me.

636
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,639
Lei…

637
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,919
Lei Yuzheng?

638
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,239
Great, it's really you.

639
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,360
You are back. You are finally back.

640
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,879
What happened to you?

641
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,000
Did you see your dad?

642
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
Did

643
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,959
your dad kick you out?

644
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,520
Actually, you were not the first one
who was kicked out.

645
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,879
He kicked out many people.

646
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,280
Qunfei, Uncle Duan,

647
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,399
and me.

648
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,840
I'm his son.

649
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,080
You can't blame him.

650
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,879
He is clear sometimes.

651
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,760
Sometimes, he doesn't remember anything.

652
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,919
This is caused by his illness.

653
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,239
Please stand up.
It's quite cold outside.

654
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,280
I can't go inside now.

655
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,840
You neither.

656
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,719
Maybe when he sees you back,
he will be happy and…

657
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,959
Uncle Duan is there. That is enough.

658
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,159
Why?

659
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,360
I don't want to irritate him.

660
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,080
Xiaosu,

661
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,719
thank you for coming
to my house every day

662
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,760
to take care of my dad
during this period.

663
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,800
But I'm back now.

664
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,040
I think I have the ability to
take care of him by myself.

665
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,399
Well…

666
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,919
Do you understand?

667
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:18,919
Lei Yuzheng!

668
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
Lei Yuzheng!

669
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,919
