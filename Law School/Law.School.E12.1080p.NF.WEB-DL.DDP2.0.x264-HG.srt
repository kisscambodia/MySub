-Hey, you!

00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,236
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,614
You can't do this to me!

4
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,698
Let go…

5
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,286
That's not enough to kill him.

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,287
Damn it.

7
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,124
Choke him harder!

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,880
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

10
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,429
Is the defense counsel not here yet?

11
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,973
ACCUSED

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,855
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

13
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,528
Don't come closer.

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,740
Kill him!

15
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,372
Get that out of my face.

16
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,998
I said, get it out of my face!

17
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,958
Come on!

18
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,836
Finish him up and rot in jail
until you die…

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,129
as a murderer.

20
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,338
Get lost!

21
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,508
Professor Yang.

22
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,218
-Damn it!
-Hey.

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,387
What? Hey!

24
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,360
Had he actually killed me,

25
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,697
you would've been charged
for incitement to murder as well.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,323
Incitement to murder?

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,951
I showed you that
he has no intention of killing you.

28
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,913
Would he kill someone
wearing a GPS ankle bracelet?

29
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,040
He wouldn't.

30
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,460
He does not want to go back to jail.

31
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,839
Delete that.

32
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,757
About the medical certificate.

33
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,803
The one that says there's a slim chance
your son's right arm and leg will recover.

34
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,513
What about it?

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,515
You and the hospital president are close.

36
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,436
Did you ask him to write it like that
to screw my client over?

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,397
Although he can recover
with physical rehabilitation.

38
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,276
That's right.
That's who you're dealing with here.

39
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,322
So cut the self-defense crap.

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,742
If that stupid girl says
she will gladly accept her punishment,

41
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll, at least, spare her
from a harsh sentence.

42
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
Shit.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>Width, 13cm. Length, 30cm.</i>
<i>They're for a shoe size of 275mm.</i>

44
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,067
Size 275mm.

45
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
Hey.

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,614
Why would you catch me?

47
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,283
Because I want to ask you something.

48
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,661
I've been meaning to visit you.

49
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,915
This.

50
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,086
It's my uncle's.

51
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,547
But someone did this.

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,468
<i>My daughter did as her mom said.</i>

53
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,933
What about it?

54
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,977
What you want to ask is "How."

55
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,312
Isn't that what you want to know?

56
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,231
How this ended up in my hands.

57
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
Prof. Yang gave it to me.

58
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,570
He said it was my uncle's.

59
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,912
Catch you later.

60
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,253
They're tracking you anyway.

61
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,713
See you at the police station.

62
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,222

You went to the hospital
upon receiving the defendant's call.

65
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,979
Yes, the emergency room.

66
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,024
Who was with the defendant at the time?

67
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,358
Han Joon-hwi was with her.

JUROR

69
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,945
Just Han Joon-hwi and no one else?

70
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,447
Correct.

71
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,325
Did they seem pretty close?

72
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,785
I thought they were dating.

73
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,454
He was very protective of her.

74
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,291
No further questions.

I won't show the photos on the screen

EVIDENCE FOR ASSAULT

91
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,073
Witness, you're the doctor
who issued her this medical certificate.

92
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,658
Correct.

93
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,577
Were these bruises caused by being beaten?

94
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,787
Yes, that is correct.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,330
How badly was she beaten?

96
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,209
Worse than this?

97
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,002
Yes.

JUROR

100
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,053
Someone kicked me,
and it was very painful.

101
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,681
I can't imagine how painful
that must've been.

102
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,893
LEFT SHOULDER, LEFT EYE, LEFT WRIST

103
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,939
-Objection.
-Can you imagine the pain?

104
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,733
Do you have evidence to prove
that Mr. Ko hit her?

105
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,485
Do you have evidence to refute it?

106
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,030
Up until the medical certificate
was issued, she was always with him.

107
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,367
The text messages and the photos here
prove that.

108
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,330
But none of them states or shows
that he physically assaulted her.

109
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,916
We can't assume he assaulted her
just based on the fact

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,085
that she was with him
before seeing the doctor.

111
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,838
What if she saw no one else
before going to the doctor's?

112
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,923
JUROR

113
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,388
Did she have company the first time
she visited your clinic?

114
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,764
Yes, she did.

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,807
Who was it?

116
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,393
From what I recall, it was her boyfriend.

117
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,314
"Boyfriend"? Are you referring
to Mr. Ko Yeong-chang, the victim?

118
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,192
I actually checked before coming here.

119
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,820
The name on the credit card
was Ko Yeong-chang.

120
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,280
I see.

121
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,533
What did Mr. Ko say to you that day?

122
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,744
He was very angry.

123
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,745
JUROR

124
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,289
He said his girlfriend was assaulted
by her stalker.

125
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,250
He asked for a medical certificate
proving bodily harm.

126
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,547
Knowing the assaulter could be prosecuted
even if the victim agreed to a settlement?

127
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,465
Yes.

128
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,176
How did the defendant react to that?

129
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,386
She didn't really say anything,

130
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,555
so I issued a certificate
proving bodily harm.

131
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,934
Did you, by any chance,
suspect that he might be the person

132
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,478
who assaulted her?

133
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,897
No, I never thought that.

134
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,857
Did you hear that?

135
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,946
Mr. Ko wasn't the assaulter
who caused her to go to the hospital.

136
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,449
In fact, he took her there
as her guardian.

MARCH 26, 2020

138
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,327

Let's get you treated
and get a medical certificate.

00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,924
I'm a complete asshole if I do this again.

143
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,592
If this happens again,

144
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,137
use the medical certificate
and file charges against me.

145
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,807
Okay?

146
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,063

Weren't you aware that
the content of your post was defamatory?

158
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,483
I had no other option.

159
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,486
Had they paid child support
as they promised--

160
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,240
So you deliberately humiliated them
to force them into giving the money?

161
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,450
Is that it?

162
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,244
I want to ask them

163
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,666
why they're refusing to pay child support
for their own child.

164
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,252

-The kids did nothing wrong.

You don't want to watch the trial?

I should watch it.

182

00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,705
I thought she looked familiar.

184
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,916
I never forget a face.

185
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,554
<i>Your Honor.</i>

186
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,599
This witness examination will be focused
on how Mr. Ko sexually assaulted Ms. Jeon.

187
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,227
It will bring back the painful memories,

188
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,272
so please allow Ms. Jeon
to leave the courtroom for a moment.

189
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,358
This is an aggravated assault trial,
not sexual assault.

190
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,777
Which wouldn't have taken place
had it not been for

191
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,362
the sexual assault and the video.

192
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,822
COURT

193
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,159
Ms. Jeon should be protected
as a sexual assault victim.

194
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
This claim cannot be sustained.

195
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,497
We do not agree that the defendant
should be seen as a victim.

196
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,875
COURT

197
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,127
ACCUSED

198
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,671
COURT

199
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,964
Witness.

200
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,842
You performed a rape kit
on Ms. Jeon, correct?

201
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,759
Yes.

202
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,636
Ms. Jeon.

203
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,099
If you're uncomfortable,
you may step out for a moment.

204
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,392
WITNESS

205
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,935
JUROR

206
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,480
I'll just stay, Your Honor.

207
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,317
JUROR 2

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,903
Joon-hwi said Juror no. 2
will be a wild card.

209
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,738
But aren't you getting a bad feeling?

210
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,452
You've examined
a number of rape victims, right?

211
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,915
Yes, I'm usually the one
who handles it at our hospital.

212
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,458
The day Mr. Ko was injured,

213
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,836
the defendant was also brought
to the hospital and was examined by you.

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,754
Yes.

215
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,131
As an experienced medical professional,

216
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,510
do you believe that
she was raped by Mr. Ko?

217
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,594
JUROR NO. 2

218
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:27,389
First and foremost, Ms. Jeon

219
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,767
seemed very nervous
when I first examined her.

220
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,646
In the examination, I noticed a few things
that would not have occurred

221
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,940
had she willfully engaged
in consensual sex.

222
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,901
Such as defensive injuries that occurred
while struggling?

223
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,194
The question is leading.

224
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,616
What are these "few things"
you're referring to?

225
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,410
There were abrasions and bruises
on her arms and legs.

226
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,080
Mr. Ko's skin cells were found
under her fingernails,

227
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,667
and there were signs of genital
and vaginal trauma. Based on such--

228
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,962
Can't they happen
during a couple's sexual activities

229
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,965
that are sadistic or rough?

230
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,925
But normally--

231
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,802
Yes or no?

232
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,137
Yes.

233
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,559
Everyone has a different palate,
and the same goes for sexual taste.

234
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,310
That is true.

235
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,020
That's right.

236
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,149
They mutually decided to record themselves
on video while having sex.

237
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,612
So why claim that he raped her
and recorded the video secretly…

238
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,990
Oh, sorry.

239
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,868
Your bullshit made me choke.

240
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,119
COURT

241
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,416
Now, let's talk about whether or not
the video was secretly recorded.

242
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,294
In other countries,
failure to pay child support

243
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,589
could be considered child abuse
and may lead to criminal penalties.

244
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,633
It is a crime that threatens
the child's right to life.

245
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,220
Failure to pay child support
infringes on the child's right to life.

246
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,474
Therefore, it is different
from other financial obligations.

247
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,019
Their personal information was published,

248
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,897
but since they are threatening
their children's right to life,

249
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,732
they brought it upon themselves.

250
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,152
They should have the decency
to pay child support if they can afford

251
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,695
a lawsuit like this.

252
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,073
They're not deliberately withholding
payment. They don't have the money--

253
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,702
The website was created because
of bad parents who can pay it but don't.

254
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,913
PYO YEONG-IN

255
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,080
RESOLVED

256
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,624
Do you know who was here?

257
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,667
Why do you ask?

258
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,587
What?

259
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,007
RESOLVED

260
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,097
<i>Even a lawyer at a big law firm</i>
<i>that everyone knows</i>

261
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,809
refused to pay child support
for his two daughters

262
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,439
until the media got wind of the story
and sent 100 million won a few days ago.

263
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,818
If you don't believe me, you can go

264
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,488
to the other courtroom
where a jury trial is being held.

265
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,283
He is there now,
as the plaintiff's attorney.

266
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su</i>
<i>supports Bad FaMa.</i>

267
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,375

<i>the child support-evading lawyer</i>

268
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,795

to represent his son.

HAEWON DAILY, REPORTER CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

270
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,769
I am covering this, but…

00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,607
OBC REPORTER KIM HYEON-JAE

272
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,276
Hey, Kim.

273
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,654
I should've done an exclusive story
on this.

274
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,197
Where are you? Hurry.

275
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,032
What? You don't care?

COURTROOM 418

277
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,048
MY HUBBY

278
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,759
The prosecutor insists
it was recorded with consent,

279
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,261
so we'll call it "the video."

280
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,220
JUROR

281
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,764
The defendant received the video
from Mr. Ko

282
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,350
at 20:15 on November 9th.

283
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,853
November 9th, 20:15.

284
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,688
This is when she received it.

285
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,608
CAM01

286
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,070
MY HUBBY, 1 VIDEO

287
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,165
She was so shocked
that she fainted right away.

288
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,835
Did you know then that
it was a secretly recorded sex video?

289
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,253
I could only guess.

290
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,423
Ye-seul was panicking,
so I couldn't ask her.

291
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,883
WITNESS

292
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,470
If it was recorded with her consent
like the prosecutor is insisting,

293
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,389
would she have reacted that way
upon receiving it?

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,515
JUROR

295
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,227
-Because it was secretly recorded--
-We can't conclude that the reaction

296
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,481
was caused by the video
based on this footage alone.

297
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,611
Witness, you ran to the hospital
with Ms. Jeon on your back

298
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,030
when the ambulance could've taken her.

299
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,365
Yes.

300
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,535
And you were with her the whole time
she was at the hospital.

301
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,245
Yes.

302
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,498
I also heard you asked a friend

303
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,794
to check on the defendant's room
after the incident.

304
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,836
PROSECUTION

305
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
Yes.

306
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,672
That was to ensure they wouldn't think

307
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,175
that she might flee
or try to destroy evidence.

308
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,929
You were afraid she'd be detained
or arrested without a warrant.

309
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,181
That's why you went all out
to protect her.

310
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,353
Then based on that, wouldn't anyone assume
that they're very close?

311
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,898
I wanted to protect her from abuse.
If you think I went "all out"…

312
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,609
Sure, I did it to protect her.

313
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,697
I stopped Assemblyman Ko when he tried
to slap her in the face at the hospital.

314
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,453
But even if it was another friend,
I'd never let something like that happen.

315
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,454
JUROR

316
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,373
I'd never let a friend suffer injustice.

317
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,292
Here, what were you and Ms. Jeon
talking about?

318
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,546
Must I tell you everything?

319
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,549
Let me rephrase that
if you're uncomfortable answering it.

320
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,970
At the time, did you know
that she was planning to testify

321
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,054
in Mr. Yang's trial?

322
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,850
I was guessing she might.

323
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,560
So you didn't know for sure.

324
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,314
Earlier, you said you had guessed
it might be a secretly recorded video.

325
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,567
That means you didn't know for sure.

326
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,945
I guess not.

327
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,904
COURT

328
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,032
As a law student,
shouldn't you have refrained

329
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,452
from testifying if it was something
you weren't sure about?

330
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,707
It could incite the jurors
to jump to conclusions.

331
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
You're right.

332
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,547
If I taught criminal law
at Hankuk University,

333
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,842
I'd teach such basics first.
He didn't teach you this?

334
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,225
The way the two of you
exchanged glances just now

335
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,603
makes me think that you two
must be very close.

336
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,689
I'd like you all to remember this.

337
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,232
JUROR

338
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,735
There, what did you give her?

339
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,989
A pledge.

340
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:03,076
Mr. Ko signed a pledge that he'd never
sneak into her room again.

341
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,537
Why is it that you got it from Mr. Ko?

342
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,540
You said you and Ms. Jeon
are just friends.

343
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,879
-That's--
-What did you say when you handed it over?

344
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,132
"You should listen to Prof. Yang,
not Yeong-chang.

345
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,801
You must listen to your professor
to survive law school."

346
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,387
If Ms. Jeon, who was taken aback
by that remark…

347
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,472
CAN WE MEET NOW?

348
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,684
…happened to see this text message
from Mr. Yang, her professor,

349
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,103
she must've been terrified, right?

350
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,193
That is why she dropped her phone
and panicked.

351
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,110
JUROR

352
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,322
-Objection, Your Honor--
-Really?

353
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,158
I thought you'd say "No objection"
or "No questions" again.

354
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
Why did you ask her to meet up
at that late hour?

355

Can't we just continue?

Go. He's a school violence assailant.
I must get him.

386
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,376
Shouldn't the police catch him?

387
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,254
We don't need to "catch" him.
I just want the case.

388
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,007

I told you he would, 100 percent.

404

We have the recording,
so he can no longer use Prosecutor Jin.

405
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,256
Thank God the police think
he should be indicted.

406
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,135
I told you that they would.
They had to, because of the recording.

Yes, it would.

-you said you'd file a petition for him.
-A petition?

444
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,034
If the victim files a petition
requesting leniency for him,

445
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,411
he may be let off with a fine
instead of probation.

To a mere civil servant

447
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,874
that is a matter of livelihood.

448
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,588
To keep his job, he had no choice,
but to give you the answer you wanted.

449
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,973
Why not lash out at me if he's that angry?

as if I was invisible?

She said to the police
she didn't report it

487
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,988
because she feared retaliation,

488
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,449
but she told the prosecutor
that love was the reason.

489
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,993
Such inconsistency could put her
at a disadvantage.

490

00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,836
Tell Prof. Yang I found out
what time Ye-seul first saw the video.

531
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:00,429
-My gosh.
-Hello.

532
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,638
Hello.

533
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:05,559
The trial seems to be going well,
thanks to Prof. Kim's testimony.

534
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,647
Even if I don't get acquitted, I want
to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

535
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,442
You helped me the most.

536
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:14,735
I didn't even do much.

537
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:18,822
If you are found guilty,
you can file an appeal.

538
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:23,202
But the prosecutor can do the same
even if I am found not guilty,

539
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:25,496
so I really hope they pass the bill.

540
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,414
The one Assemblyman Ko proposed today

541
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:30,834
for abolishing the current defamation law
for publicly alleging facts.

542
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,252
That bill is…

543
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,300
I promise you that I will fight with you
until the end.

544
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:41,095
-We got this.
-We got this.

545
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:44,973
Right, it'd be nice
if they passed that bill.

546
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:46,850
No.

547
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,269
But I refuse to support Ko Hyeong-su.

548
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:51,730
What?

549
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:55,192
I'm also against punishing those
who tell the truth

550
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,528
and think the defamation law
should be abolished.

551
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:00,989
But I'm really against Ko Hyeong-su
getting credit for it.

552
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:02,616
I can't let that happen.

553
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:04,576
So what's your point?

554
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,328
My point?

555
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,539
So I'm going to…

556
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,667
Why isn't she texting me back?

557
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:37,609

COURT

567
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:23,363
There she is.

568
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:26,033
Where's Prof. Yang?

569
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:28,160
-I thought you guys were with him.
-No.

570
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:32,080
Maybe he's pulling his hair out somewhere
because Prosecutor Bae got him good.

571
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:34,917
Based on the evidence so far,
it'll be difficult for Ye-seul

572
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,170
to prove that she was trying to stop him
from disseminating…

573
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:39,087
What?

574
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:41,298
COURT

575
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:52,809
We know when she first watched the video.

576
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:59,191
Are you going to have Seung-jae
testify for her?

577
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:12,871
I don't want to be on the witness stand.

578
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:32,099
DIGITAL FORENSICS REPORT

579
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:34,434
MESSAGE, INCOMING

580
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:36,812
DON'T FORGET THIS LONG NIGHT WE HAD
MY HUBBY

581
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:47,114
Are you saying you just helped Ms. Jeon
with her studies because you two

582
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:51,743
were in the same study group?
You're just friends and nothing more?

583
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:53,412
Correct.

584
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:56,456
In the group, there is someone
who I really want to look out for,

585
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,542
but it's not Ye-seul.

586
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,751
JUROR

587
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:03,422
It's someone in the study group?
Then the person must be here.

588
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:06,883
Everyone in the group is here
to help Ms. Jeon.

589
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:10,929
-Yes.
-Who is it?

590
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,935
Tell us who it is.

591
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:21,898
You can tell us unless this is a trick
to hide your relationship with Ms. Jeon.

592
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:47,049
Where is it?

593
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:49,384
How dare you touch my stuff?

594
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:51,094
I have no power, you see.

595
00:36:51,178 --> 00:36:52,929
All I did was carry out the orders.

596
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:55,932
-Hey.
-Get lost!

597
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:58,810
Damn it!

598
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:01,730
Shit.

599
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:03,732
JIN HYEONG-U

600
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:05,442
Shit.

601
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:08,528
YANG JONG-HOON

602
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:10,113
Damn.

603
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:23,335
If your Bad FaMa client
is found not guilty,

604
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:25,837
you'll have me to thank for.

605
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,424
So I have to say I was pretty upset
when you brought up Attorney Song.

606
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,640
But I hope…

607
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:42,104
you're not going to break your promise
just because of that.

608
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:45,941
The promise you made
upon receiving the Lee Man-ho bill.

609
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:47,359
Of course, I won't.

610
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:49,861
I even got choked by him
while provoking him

611
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:51,655
with the recording that you had sent.

612
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,074
You must keep the promise

613
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:57,160
even if someone threatens you
with a knife.

614
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,537
Yes, of course.

615
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,123
As long as

616
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:05,252
Yang Jong-hoon isn't the one
holding the knife.

617
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,712
Don't drag me into his problem.

618
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:19,766
I have to go watch your son's trial.
Well, then.

619
00:38:21,977 --> 00:38:23,812
-Shall we head out together?
-Go ahead.

620
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:28,733
Hey.

621
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:30,777
What?

622
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:47,127
JAMES

623
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,243
Hi! How's it going?

624
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,412
<i>I'm doing great. How are you?</i>

625
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,956
-I'm fine.
<i>-Are you busy right now?</i>

626
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:58,221
Ms. Jeon, you're studying law
to become a law professional.

627
00:38:58,305 --> 00:38:59,347
Right?

628
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:00,849
WITNESS

629
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:01,808
Yes.

630
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:03,351
Then I'm sure

631
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:06,563
you were fully aware that filming someone
without their consent,

632
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:10,275
especially during sex,
is considered a serious criminal offense.

633
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:13,945
Yes.

634
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,698
If Mr. Ko physically abused you
and also filmed you

635
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:20,285
without your consent,
why didn't you report it to the police?

636
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:29,503
As someone who is studying to work in law,
why didn't she report such a crime?

637
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:33,673
Especially when she has a history

638
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:36,218
of filing a police report
against a college friend

639
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,637
who stalked her
before she started law school.

640
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,847
JUROR

641
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,894
What's going on?

642
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:47,395
-Who's that?
-Ko Yeong-chang!

643
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,438
-What?
-Mr. Ko.

644
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:50,065
-Ko Yeong-chang, right?
-Mr. Ko!

645
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,858
-Mr. Ko.
-Why is he here?

646
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:53,527
-Mr. Ko.
-Is it really him?

647
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,111
Mr. Ko, how are you feeling?

648
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:56,488
-Mr. Ko!
-Please step back.

649
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:57,447
Just a comment!

650
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,365
Please step back.

651
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:00,200
-What's going on?
-My apologies.

652
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,661
The victim wanted to be here,
so I brought him.

653
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:08,166
Prosecutor, please continue.

654
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:15,423
WITNESS

655
00:40:15,507 --> 00:40:18,176
You can have some water before you answer.

656
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:24,266
According to your statement,

657
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:27,394
you didn't report him to the police
because you loved him.

658
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:29,354
Was that the reason?

659
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:34,568
You put up with the sexual assault
because you loved him?

660
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:38,113
That doesn't make much sense.

661
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:43,451
But if this statement is true,
you loved him enough to put up with it.

662
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:47,664
Then it's understandable
that you totally lost it and attacked him

663
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:50,417
the moment you heard him say
he wanted to end things.

664
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:54,629
-That is total baloney.
-That is total baloney.

665
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,464
Hoping he'd let you go unpunished

666
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:58,842
for the injuries you had inflicted
upon him,

667
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,637
are you now saying you were raped
though you actually had sex with him?

668
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,018
Her claim that she kept quiet out of love
is not true.

669
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:12,355
She had no reason to report him
in the first place

670
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:16,359
because Mr. Ko never assaulted her
in any way.

671
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:19,279
Defendant.

672
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:22,741
Calm down and return to your seat.

673
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:29,914
COURT

674
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:33,752
If you leave the courtroom now,
it may be used against you.

675
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:41,343
Please make that jerk leave the courtroom!

676
00:41:41,426 --> 00:41:44,387
Juror no. 4, if you speak
without permission one more time,

677
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,723
-you'll be asked to leave.
-Tell her to leave now.

678
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:52,062
I request we take a recess.

679
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,229
Let's just continue.

680
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:56,358
JUROR

681
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:57,317
Your Honor.

682
00:41:57,984 --> 00:41:59,944
COURT

683
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:04,115
I'd like to give Ye-seul what she wants.

684
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,035
Mr. Ko, I will give you a chance
to speak--

685
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,119
It's okay.

686
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,705
I have nothing to say.

687
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:14,000
Ye-seul and I were going to get married.

688
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:17,545
But just because she cheated on me
with a smarter guy at the law school

689
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,840
and let her professor threaten her
and toy with her,

690
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:25,804
I wanted to end things.
So it is my own fault.

691
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,975
I understand why she got so angry
and lashed out at me.

692
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:33,186
Your Honor.

693
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:36,564
Please just give her what she wants.

694
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:41,403
If she can be happy,

695
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:42,904
I'll gladly

696
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:47,158
be called a rapist.

697
00:42:48,284 --> 00:42:50,662
Jeez, that douchebag is really something.

698
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:51,663
JUROR

699
00:42:51,746 --> 00:42:53,873
Half of my body is paralyzed now anyway,

700
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:56,501
so I don't care if people call me
a shameless criminal.

701
00:42:56,584 --> 00:43:01,047
I just feel horrible, thinking about
what my father might have to go through

702
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:04,050
because of his stupid son
who was crazy about his girlfriend…

703
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:08,722
Hurry. Take him back to the hospital.

704
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,014
-What?
-Wait, hold on!

705
00:43:10,098 --> 00:43:11,683

00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:54,494
-If you hand over that photo.
-After you give

-Hey.

Case number 2020-GH311.

767
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:32,408
Ms. Jeon and Mr. Ko
were in a relationship.

768
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:35,244
Jeon was indicted for inflicting
serious injuries on Ko

769
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:38,039
during their heated argument
about a video of their sex.

770
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:41,083
However, Jeon insists that
she acted in self-defense

771
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,961
while trying to stop Ko
from disseminating the video.

772
00:46:44,045 --> 00:46:45,379
What is the main issue here?

COURT

776
00:47:01,604 --> 00:47:03,773
Depending on the results of our trials,

777
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:05,316
this could be our last class.

778
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:08,110

JUROR

782
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,873
It's whether or not the video

783
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:23,751
was recorded secretly.

784
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:25,294
-That's it?
-Pardon me?

785
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:28,130
Is that enough for her to claim
she acted in self-defense?

786
00:47:31,592 --> 00:47:33,928
Also whether he tried
to disseminate the video…

787
00:47:34,011 --> 00:47:35,846
Why do the prosecutors disagree?

She didn't get angry at him…

791
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:49,360
She neither got angry at Ko
nor told him to delete the video.

JUROR

793
00:47:50,444 --> 00:47:52,989
When he texted her and asked
if she had watched it,

794
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:57,118
she wrote back "yeah" instead of "yes".

795
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,956
<i>-Did you watch it?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

796
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,792
What's wrong with writing "yeah"
instead of "yes"?

797
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:07,587
That's…

798
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,464
"Yeah" connotes closeness.

799
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:14,844
It's not a reaction expected from someone
who's shocked after watching such a video.

800
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,805
TEXT CONVERSATION

801
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:19,724
At the Training Institute,

802
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:22,852
one of my peers asked me out.

803
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:25,271
I rejected her,

804
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:27,982
but she acted as if
we were even closer than before.

805
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,861
I was quite puzzled by her reaction.

806
00:48:31,944 --> 00:48:34,572
I flat out rejected her,
so she must've been shocked.

807
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:35,990
Why didn't she get angry--

808
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:39,827
Not everyone gets angry when they're
shocked or when their pride is hurt.

809
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,830
Unless she was going to cut ties with him,
getting angry at him--

810
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:45,875
I see.

PROSECUTION

812
00:48:49,086 --> 00:48:51,881
Another reason they think the video
wasn't recorded secretly?

813

I…

814
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:01,057
Because Jeon's statements
weren't consistent.

815
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,308
They weren't consistent?

816
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:03,392
WITNESS

817
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:07,521
Initially, she said it was because
she feared retaliation.

818
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:10,691
But then, she said it was because
she loved Ko.

819
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:14,111
The lack of consistency means
she wasn't raped and knew about the video?

820
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,655
I see.

821
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:17,365
Do you agree?

822
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:23,120
Did you not do your assignment again?

823
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,498
I told you to read up on the precedents.

824
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,918

SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES

826
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:38,678
The Supreme Court
recently quashed the acquittal

827
00:49:39,553 --> 00:49:41,514
of a sexual assault assailant,

828
00:49:41,597 --> 00:49:43,933
granted due to the victim's
inconsistent statements.

829
00:49:44,016 --> 00:49:45,601
Why was it quashed?

830
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:48,854
Because a little bit of inconsistency
does not mean

831
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:51,315
her arguments and their credibility
can be nullified.

832
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:55,528
And the victim's extraordinary
circumstances weren't considered--

833
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:58,906
Then what are Jeon's extraordinary
circumstances in this case?

834
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:05,454
-What are her extraordinary circumstances?
-The fact that…

835
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:11,419
she was raped by the man
she was engaged to and loved.

836
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,507
So intimate partner rape is different
from other types of sexual assault.

837
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,466
How's it different?

838

If it was a complete stranger,

841
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:37,319
I'd think of it as a terrible nightmare
and shake it off.

After watching the video,
Jeon was shocked and started to panic.

846
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,346
But she felt that she had to text him
"yeah" as usual,

847
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,848
because had she not replied,

848
00:51:07,475 --> 00:51:10,102

that of Ko Yeong-chang's dashcam.

860
00:51:48,015 --> 00:51:49,099
He can't refute this.

861
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:51,143
He wanted to disseminate it,
not delete it.

I didn't report it to the police because…

I couldn't even bear the thought

against your boyfriend?

884
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:01,023
Are you sure you were sexually assaulted?"

885
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:04,068
-Objection--
-That is not allowed in my class.

886
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,742
COURT

887
00:54:12,618 --> 00:54:14,203
Now, if you were the judge…

888
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:18,332
If I were the judge…

889
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:25,172
COURT

890
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:27,967
What would you do if you were me?

891
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:34,390
I pondered this question over and over.

892
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:38,477
"What did I do wrong
that I'm being tried in court?"

893
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:51,198
PROSECUTION

894
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:57,079
PROSECUTION

895
00:55:10,676 --> 00:55:14,513
While trying to protect herself
from the horrendous situation

896
00:55:14,596 --> 00:55:17,141
of the sex video
being widely disseminated,

897
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:21,186
she unintentionally caused injury to Ko
by pushing him.

898
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:23,981
Based on the Criminal Code Article 21,

899
00:55:24,815 --> 00:55:27,359
this was an act performed
to prevent unjust infringement.

900
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:30,112
ARTICLE 21 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE
- SELF-DEFENSE

901
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:32,156
So I'd conclude she acted in self-defense.

902
00:55:35,325 --> 00:55:36,618
COURT

903
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:53,844
COURT

904
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:56,013
IN SESSION

905
00:55:56,096 --> 00:55:57,473
Mr. Kang.

906
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:02,269
Prof. Yang said he has a smoking gun
of some sort.

907
00:56:03,812 --> 00:56:04,772
Is it you?

908
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:09,943
Dad, is it you?

909
00:56:14,531 --> 00:56:15,532
Then who…

910
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:18,452
IN SESSION

911
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:21,330
TODAY'S COURT SCHEDULE

912
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:22,331
It's me.

913
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,711
Your dissertation.

914
00:56:27,795 --> 00:56:29,254
COURTROOM 418

915
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:31,632
I helped my uncle
when he was working on it.

916
00:56:33,842 --> 00:56:36,720
It can only be ruled self-defense
if it was an act

917
00:56:36,804 --> 00:56:39,723
performed in order to prevent impending
and unjust infringement.

918
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,647
COURT

919
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,649
JUROR

920
00:56:50,526 --> 00:56:53,862
If he punches me
after getting kicked in the shin,

921
00:56:53,946 --> 00:56:57,116
it's considered mutual combat
and won't be ruled self-defense.

922
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:04,081
If he tries to defend himself
as I'm attacking him like this,

923
00:57:04,164 --> 00:57:05,958
it'll be ruled self-defense.

924
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,668
Let's look at the screen.

925
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:14,967
Here. The phone fell on the ground.

926
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,137
Ye-seul kicked him after that,
wearing her high heels.

927
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,847
Oh, you're right.

928
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,141
Ko dropped his phone, which means,

929
00:57:22,224 --> 00:57:26,145
he couldn't disseminate it at the time,
so she should've stopped attacking him.

930
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:27,146
No.

931
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:30,232
She was panicking.
What if she didn't see him drop his phone?

932
00:57:30,315 --> 00:57:33,652
-I mean, it was dark.
-Did you know he dropped his phone?

933
00:57:36,363 --> 00:57:38,699
We'll consider
all extenuating circumstances.

934
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:42,119
You knew about his phone,
but kicked him wearing the heels

935
00:57:42,202 --> 00:57:43,954
because you were so angry, right?

936
00:57:47,082 --> 00:57:51,628
You kicked him knowing that his phone
had fallen on the ground, didn't you?

937
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:53,797
You said this earlier.

938
00:57:54,548 --> 00:57:57,342
"I wanted to hit that jerk with this
and pummel him to death."

939
00:57:59,678 --> 00:58:02,306
She should say no even if she knew.
That's what I'd do.

940
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:04,016
Ko is the bad guy here.

941
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:05,517
I'd save myself.

942
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:08,854
You kicked him even though you knew
that his phone had fallen

943
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:11,106
on the ground, right?

944
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,068
Yes.

945
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,075
For this to be ruled self-defense,

946
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,078
the defendant should've stopped
attacking him

947
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:27,456
the moment Mr. Ko's phone
slipped out of his hand.

948
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:32,669
But as she admitted just now--

949
00:58:32,753 --> 00:58:33,670
Are you blind?

950
00:58:33,754 --> 00:58:35,088
Look at that.

951
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:39,259
She did it because she was afraid
that jerk would pick up his phone.

952
00:58:39,801 --> 00:58:40,636
COURT

953
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:41,637
Juror no. 4.

954
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,306
JUROR 4

955
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:45,766
WITNESS

956
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,769
<i>I don't think I can say no</i>

957
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:50,812
<i>if I knew about it.</i>

958
00:58:51,438 --> 00:58:55,400
But I probably would've done
exactly what Ye-seul did.

959
00:58:55,484 --> 00:58:57,402
Out of fear that he'd pick up his phone.

960
00:58:57,486 --> 00:58:58,862
I think that's what happened.

961
00:58:59,446 --> 00:59:01,698
In other words,
the unjust infringement continued.

962
00:59:01,782 --> 00:59:03,283
He didn't actually pick it up.

963
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:07,829
If he tried to pick it up, we cannot say
the unjust infringement continued.

964
00:59:15,963 --> 00:59:17,172
Say that again.

965
00:59:17,256 --> 00:59:19,216
They proved his attempt to disseminate it.

966
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:21,677
Depending on whether or not
it's ruled self-defense--

967
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,471
Damn, that idiot Jin Hyeong-u!
What has he been doing?

968
00:59:24,555 --> 00:59:27,599
-I even went there and put on a show--
-Shut up!

969
00:59:32,187 --> 00:59:34,356
-Tell Prosecutor Jin
-Yes, sir.

970
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:36,316
to do whatever it takes

971
00:59:36,942 --> 00:59:40,529
to get Juror no. 4 kicked out
before the jurors' discussion begins.

972
00:59:40,612 --> 00:59:43,740
Thankfully, Juror no. 4
is an alternate juror.

973
00:59:46,952 --> 00:59:48,120
I see.

974
00:59:50,455 --> 00:59:53,584
I'll take a quick shower
and return before the discussion is over.

975
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:54,835
Okay.

976
00:59:54,918 --> 00:59:58,922
I sent the photo to Choi after confirming
that he gave his statement.

977
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:00,424
He wrote an article right away.

978
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,134
Okay.

979
01:00:02,217 --> 01:00:03,218
KO HYEONG-SU ATTACKED

980
01:00:03,302 --> 01:00:04,928
ATTACKED BY LEE MAN-HO

981
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:13,604
Assemblyman Ko wants to get Lee Man-ho
locked up for attempted murder.

982
01:00:13,687 --> 01:00:14,813
I'd appreciate that.

983
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:16,815
So I won't have to check this.

984
01:00:18,692 --> 01:00:20,777
Give it to my roomie
you want to look out for.

985
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:24,906
What? Are you disappointed
that it's not you?

986
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:28,994
Well, that makes me want
to look out for you, too.

987
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:39,004
Byeol is home alone.

988
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:43,050
Right, alternate jurors also have to stay
until the end.

989
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:44,968
MILL

990
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:46,845
Hold on.

991
01:00:53,393 --> 01:00:54,811
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

992
01:01:04,696 --> 01:01:07,157
You somehow managed to win
Reporter Choi over.

993
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:13,538
You think you can use this
to bring me to trial?

994
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:14,623
You will be indicted.

995
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:17,959
You want to clear your father's name
by making me a defendant?

996
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:21,755
I told you to stop messing with me.
You just can't take hints.

997
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:25,384
Why do you think I sat in on this trial?

998
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,231
What you see isn't everything.

999
01:01:40,357 --> 01:01:43,235
But then again, how would you know
the substantial truth

1000
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:45,529
that even your father didn't know
until he died?

1001
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:55,664
You need to learn about it
if you want to work in law.

1002
01:01:58,291 --> 01:01:59,292
Am I wrong?

1003
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:13,348
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

1004
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:15,475
Did you read the article about Lee Man-ho?

1005
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:17,853
Where is he now?

1006
01:02:17,936 --> 01:02:20,772
He hasn't stepped out of his house
since the article came out.

1007
01:02:20,856 --> 01:02:22,357
EUNPYEONG-GU

1008
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:23,859
LEE MAN-HO

1009
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,072
Please call me
if you notice anything unusual.

1010
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,798
KO HYEONG-SU ATTACKED

1011
01:02:56,475 --> 01:02:58,977
I gave you my blood to save your life.

1012
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,605
You can't do this to me.

<i>The real culprit is caught.</i>

1015
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:42,521
As if it was not enough to dig up
Ko's back. You didn't bribe them, did you?

1016
01:03:42,604 --> 01:03:44,689
<i>It won't be acknowledged as self-defense.</i>

1017
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,484
<i>It means Lee Man-ho is the real culprit.</i>

1018
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:49,986
<i>Tell that jerk Choi</i>
<i>to walk back his remarks</i>

1019
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:52,781
and make it
look like you caught the culprit.

1020
01:03:52,864 --> 01:03:55,033
I don't think I can work for you anymore.

1021
01:03:55,617 --> 01:03:57,410
Did you really kill Seo Byung-ju?
