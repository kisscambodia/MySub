00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:57.389 line:85.83%,end
That must be it.

00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:10.902 line:85.83%,end
I guess you've learned many things
working in the agency.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.656 line:85.83%,end
Scheming, buck-passing,
and framing people without evidence.

00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:18.368 line:85.83%,end
You live up to your reputation.
That's fantastic.

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:24.708 line:85.83%,end
You think it's funny?

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:28.878 line:85.83%,end
How about I work on you
to really live up to my reputation?

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.259 line:85.83%,end
Look,

00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:36.511 line:85.83%,end
Dung Fly.

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.060 line:85.83%,end
Don't ever aspire to become the President.

00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:49.482 line:85.83%,end
A punk like you who doesn't use money
for politics and keeps it for himself

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:51.401 line:85.83%,end
should never be a politician.

00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:56.364 line:85.83%,end
You're a master at framing people.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:27:00.035 line:85.83%,end
You must be planning to frame me for this
and take the credit.

00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:03.747 line:85.83%,end
You reckless punk.

00:27:05.081 --> 00:27:07.917 line:85.83%,end
You dare touch Code 1's money?

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:11.379 line:85.83%,end
He won't even send you to prison.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.467 line:85.83%,end
He'll probably cut off all your limbs
while you're alive and grind you up.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.429 line:85.83%,end
Wait, no. That's been done before.
He hates copying others.

00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:21.514 line:85.83%,end
Since he's an animal lover,

00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:26.394 line:85.83%,end
he'll probably throw your wife and kids
to crocodiles without anyone knowing.

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.067 line:85.83%,end
Well, I justâ€¦

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:38.782 line:85.83%,end
tried to increase the amount
as a person in charge of his safe.

00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:40.450 line:85.83%,end
You idiot!

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:52.837 line:85.83%,end
Will you drag me into this
and plunge into deep water,

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:56.132 line:85.83%,end
or will you join hands with me
and soar into the sky again?

00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:10.105 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam, please save me.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.691 line:85.83%,end
If you do, my life is yours.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:18.113 line:85.83%,end
Uncuff me first, you bastard.

00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:35.630 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-yaâ€¦

00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:38.133 line:85.83%,end
What will you do about her?

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:42.303 line:85.83%,end
I'll get rid of all the evidence
related to her!

00:28:49.769 --> 00:28:51.187 line:85.83%,end
Let me slap you just once.

00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:03.950 line:85.83%,end
Thank you, sir.

00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:06.703 line:85.83%,end
-How's it going at the scene?
-There's nothing-- No.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:10.206 line:85.83%,end
The spies say
they'll release the hostages.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.541 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.960 line:85.83%,end
But they all know
Cheong-ya is a Northern spy!

00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:15.712 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:17.297 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam.

00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:20.675 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.343 line:85.83%,end
When is Mr. Nam coming?

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.012 line:85.83%,end
I can't reach him.

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.221 line:85.83%,end
Where's the detonator?

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:26.806 line:85.83%,end
The detonator!

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:28.808 line:85.83%,end
You bastards.

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:31.895 line:85.83%,end
They're planning to release the hostages,
but you're eating noodles?

00:29:31.978 --> 00:29:33.062 line:85.83%,end
Get him the detonator!

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:34.731 line:85.83%,end
Before the hostages are released!

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:38.526 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry up!
-Be careful.

00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:14.938 line:85.83%,end
Captain.

00:30:15.021 --> 00:30:15.855 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:19.609 line:85.83%,end
At 22:00 sharp, we will blow up the dorm.

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.110 line:85.83%,end
Get it ready.

00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:23.571 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.
