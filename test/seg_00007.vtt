00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:04.954 line:85.83%,end
All units, stand by.

00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:06.455 line:85.83%,end
All units, stand by.

00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:13.379 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam Tae-il!

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:48.414 line:85.83%,end
After deceiving the whole country
pretending you were about to die,

00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:51.125 line:85.83%,end
you come here walking on your own?

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.460 line:85.83%,end
Are you disappointed?

00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:55.504 line:85.83%,end
You should've had a better sniper do it.

00:36:57.798 --> 00:36:58.633 line:85.83%,end
Arrest him.

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.474 line:85.83%,end
Don't come any closer.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:10.228 line:85.83%,end
Don't come closer! This is the detonator.
They all die if I press this.

00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:20.529 line:85.83%,end
Chief An.

00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:23.741 line:85.83%,end
What the hell are you doing?

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:28.329 line:85.83%,end
He's violated the Military Secret
Protection Law and National Security Law.

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:29.497 line:85.83%,end
He's a criminal.

00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:32.083 line:85.83%,end
Do you have proof?

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:36.212 line:85.83%,end
Show me the evidence
that I violated those!

00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:38.464 line:85.83%,end
How shameless.

00:37:38.547 --> 00:37:41.759 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-ya,
your personal doctor, is a Northern spy!

00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:42.802 line:85.83%,end
You little…

00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:43.970 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Hong.

00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:46.597 line:85.83%,end
We looked into that.

00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:47.890 line:85.83%,end
And we didn't…

00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:54.647 line:85.83%,end
find any evidence of Dr. Kang being a spy.

00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:00.194 line:85.83%,end
This is

00:38:01.487 --> 00:38:03.072 line:85.83%,end
slander!

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.245 line:85.83%,end
He's been loyally serving the country.

00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:11.497 line:85.83%,end
But he did what with a commie?

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.166 line:85.83%,end
That's just wrong!

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.294 line:85.83%,end
That's just absurd!

00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:19.297 line:85.83%,end
-What are you doing here?
-What happened to the 300 million?

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.048 line:85.83%,end
Look, Ms. Cho Seong-sim.

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.758 line:85.83%,end
You can't just deny it.

00:38:22.842 --> 00:38:24.844 line:85.83%,end
The truth will be revealed eventually.

00:38:25.678 --> 00:38:26.637 line:85.83%,end
Did you see it?

00:38:27.221 --> 00:38:28.639 line:85.83%,end
Do you have proof?

00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:31.726 line:85.83%,end
Lower your guns.

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.102 line:85.83%,end
Now!

00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:36.564 line:85.83%,end
How dare you! He's the former Army Chief
of Staff's son-in-law!

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:41.152 line:85.83%,end
How dare you point a gun
at the ruling party's Secretary-General?

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.487 line:85.83%,end
Honey!

00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:46.198 line:85.83%,end
Arrest all of them for defamation.

00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:48.492 line:85.83%,end
Lower your guns, you bastards! Now!

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:51.078 line:85.83%,end
Lower it! Yes. Now!

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:53.331 line:85.83%,end
Damn you!

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.963 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's me, Cheong-ya.</i>

00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:04.050 line:85.83%,end
<i>You're listening, right?</i>

00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:18.356 line:85.83%,end
You see,

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:22.109 line:85.83%,end
<i>I took a secret Swiss bank account
that has 300 million dollars in it</i>

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:26.155 line:85.83%,end
and came back into the dorm with it.

00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:31.952 line:85.83%,end
<i>So if you blow up the dorm, honey,</i>

00:39:32.995 --> 00:39:35.081 line:85.83%,end
this money will be gone too.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.587 line:85.83%,end
<i>Well, if you don't care,
go ahead and press the detonator.</i>

00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:50.096 line:85.83%,end
<i>We promised to go to the Maldives
for vacation. I'm sorry I can't go.</i>

00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:00.439 line:85.83%,end
That cunning whore!

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.359 line:85.83%,end
Honey, don't be fooled!

00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:06.487 line:85.83%,end
She's trying to drag us down with her!

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:09.532 line:85.83%,end
It wasn't me
who lost the 300 million dollars.

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:12.660 line:85.83%,end
It was him! An Gyeong-hui lost it.

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.413 line:85.83%,end
What? Are you seriously doing this?

00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:18.290 line:85.83%,end
What? Are you stabbing me in the back?

00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.417 line:85.83%,end
Everyone heard it, right?

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.172 line:85.83%,end
You little bastard, how dare you!

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.509 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you hear
she's trying to drag us down!

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:31.929 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean, "little bastard"?

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.808 line:85.83%,end
I know you're very shocked
by your husband's affair,

00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:37.643 line:85.83%,end
but you're way out of line!

00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:42.648 line:85.83%,end
Hey! You took a bribe of a 5-carat
diamond ring from Kang Cheong-ya.

00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:45.901 line:85.83%,end
You're the one
who gave her the 300 million dollars.

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:47.486 line:85.83%,end
How shameless!

00:40:48.487 --> 00:40:52.283 line:85.83%,end
That's right. They're the ones
guilty of espionage!

00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:56.996 line:85.83%,end
You might make up
my son's birthday at this rate. Hey!

00:40:57.663 --> 00:41:00.708 line:85.83%,end
We're suffering
because your husband had an affair

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.334 line:85.83%,end
with a Northern spy!

00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:04.837 line:85.83%,end
We were only trying to make an investment
