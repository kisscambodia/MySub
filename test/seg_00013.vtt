-Take off your clothes.
-Pardon?

01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:54.737 line:85.83%,end
Change into these.

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:56.614 line:85.83%,end
We're leaving soon.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.714 line:85.83%,end
To be honest,

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:18.302 line:85.83%,end
I don't want to take you with us since
you're injured and will slow us down.

01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:22.807 line:85.83%,end
But Comrade Lim is adamant
about taking you.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.645 line:85.83%,end
He says he can't abandon you
like our party did.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:34.985 line:85.83%,end
I'll be back in ten minutes.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.655 line:85.83%,end
If you don't get changed until then,

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.242 line:85.83%,end
we won't take you.

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:04.974 line:85.83%,end
Get changed right now.

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:06.600 line:85.83%,end
You must get out of here.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.946 line:85.83%,end
You must

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.533 line:85.83%,end
stay alive.

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:26.453 line:85.83%,end
Okay?

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.914 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.876 line:85.83%,end
Hurry and change.

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.970 line:85.83%,end
Are you freaking kidding me?

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.266 line:85.83%,end
No cameras or parents? You promised us.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.393 line:85.83%,end
What are you trying to pull?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.772 line:85.83%,end
Are you really going to…

01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:57.568 line:85.83%,end
kill all the students?

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:00.404 line:85.83%,end
Listen to me, Gang-mu.

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:03.407 line:85.83%,end
While I was in the hospital,

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.118 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:09.788 line:85.83%,end
told Code 1
that the students had found out

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:14.335 line:85.83%,end
<i>this hostage situation is
an election scheme.</i>

01:10:15.252 --> 01:10:19.089 line:85.83%,end
<i>He even told him that the spies were</i>

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:22.259 line:85.83%,end
<i>disobeying the North's orders.</i>

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.179 line:85.83%,end
Code 1 furiously ordered me

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:27.765 line:85.83%,end
to blow up the dorm right away.

01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:29.767 line:85.83%,end
<i>So how can I</i>

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:34.688 line:85.83%,end
<i>set up broadcast cameras
and bring the parents?</i>

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:40.110 line:85.83%,end
You're not trustworthy as I expected.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.947 line:85.83%,end
Our deal is off.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.200 line:85.83%,end
You'll never get back
the 300 million dollars.

01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:47.326 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.121 line:85.83%,end
After you all

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.667 line:85.83%,end
get out of there,

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.168 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm going to</i>

01:10:56.627 --> 01:11:02.174 line:85.83%,end
make public that the hostage situation
was an election scheme.

01:11:03.467 --> 01:11:06.011 line:85.83%,end
<i>On my late son's honor…</i>

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.265 line:85.83%,end
<i>No, on my daughter Yeong-ro,</i>

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:11.642 line:85.83%,end
I promise you.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.895 line:85.83%,end
<i>Yeong-ro said she wouldn't be able</i>

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:19.149 line:85.83%,end
to carry on if the students died.

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:23.195 line:85.83%,end
I can finally see that.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.658 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm doing this</i>

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:31.078 line:85.83%,end
<i>to save my Yeong-ro. So, please…</i>

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.372 line:85.83%,end
<i>Please</i>

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.666 line:85.83%,end
<i>trust me this once</i>

01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.210 line:85.83%,end
<i>and you guys</i>

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.921 line:85.83%,end
get out of there first.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.012 line:85.83%,end
Listen, Director Eun.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:51.140 line:85.83%,end
Okay. We'll leave the hostages to you

01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:52.558 line:85.83%,end
and get out first.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:54.810 line:85.83%,end
Through the shrine at midnight.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:11:59.857 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang.

01:12:01.358 --> 01:12:03.986 line:85.83%,end
I can't trust Eun Chang-su.

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:07.448 line:85.83%,end
We should get out
after releasing the hostages.

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:11.452 line:85.83%,end
I understand.

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:15.039 line:85.83%,end
This hostage situation started
because of you,

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:17.833 line:85.83%,end
so you must feel guilty
and want to save them.

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:21.378 line:85.83%,end
But we're running out of time.

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:25.883 line:85.83%,end
Decide.

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:27.593 line:85.83%,end
Is it our agents

01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:30.095 line:85.83%,end
or the hostages?
