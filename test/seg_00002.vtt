00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:03.227 line:85.83%,end
Call the Airport District right now.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.229 line:85.83%,end
-Yes, sir.
-What does Linda Young look like?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.023 line:85.83%,end
Tell me now!

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.236 line:85.83%,end
The company funds?

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.370 line:85.83%,end
Moran Hill 1 intercepted the money

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.748 line:85.83%,end
the South was going to send us.

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:25.791 line:85.83%,end
And the ANSP found out her identity.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.087 line:85.83%,end
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: CHONGCHON RIVER

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.174 line:85.83%,end
"Kang Cheong-ya
would never betray the party"?

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:37.011 line:85.83%,end
As if your son was not enough,
and now Kang Cheong-ya?

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.848 line:85.83%,end
If we won't be able to get the money,

00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:42.224 line:85.83%,end
it's all on you!

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:52.026 line:85.83%,end
Instruct Chongchon River
to kill Lim Soo-ho right away!

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.613 line:85.83%,end
Tell him now

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.325 line:85.83%,end
we will guarantee his family's safety
if he kills that bastard.

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.592 line:85.83%,end
<i>Eliminate Lim Soo-ho.</i>

00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:19.053 line:85.83%,end
<i>Your family's safety guaranteed.</i>

00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:43.327 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo, what did the party say?

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.539 line:85.83%,end
There's no way they haven't replied yet.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:49.625 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo!

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.214 line:85.83%,end
"Message well received.

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.800 line:85.83%,end
Maintain the status quo."

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.603 line:85.83%,end
MESSAGE WELL RECEIVED.
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO.

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:33.377 line:85.83%,end
Now that they've received the message,
Lim Ji-rok will be dismissed, right?

00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:35.129 line:85.83%,end
Most likely.

00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:39.759 line:85.83%,end
Then they're not going
to kill your sister today.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.596 line:85.83%,end
But Comrade Kang's run off
with the money. What do we do now?

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.813 line:85.83%,end
Eun Chang-su

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:57.359 line:85.83%,end
has offered to help us
flee to another country safely.

00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:02.740 line:85.83%,end
-What do you guys think?
-Are you insane?

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:05.159 line:85.83%,end
How can we trust him?

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.786 line:85.83%,end
We can't.

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:11.415 line:85.83%,end
We shouldn't trust him,
but we can use his offer to our advantage.

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:14.084 line:85.83%,end
The election is in five days.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:17.421 line:85.83%,end
If we stay here like this, in five days…

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:20.758 line:85.83%,end
we'll all die.

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.807 line:85.83%,end
If you guys decide to stay here,
I will too.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.308 line:85.83%,end
But…

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.520 line:85.83%,end
if you think

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.440 line:85.83%,end
your family will be safe if you die here,
you're mistaken.

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.571 line:85.83%,end
We must live

00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:45.741 line:85.83%,end
to find a way to save our families.

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:50.120 line:85.83%,end
I will do as you say, Comrade Lim.

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:17.231 line:85.83%,end
<i>Stand by at the hideout
and kill Moran Hill 1 if she comes.</i>

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:24.363 line:85.83%,end
Have you seen this person?

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.156 line:85.83%,end
-It's a woman.
-It is.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.159 line:85.83%,end
-Look closely.
-Okay. Have you seen her?
