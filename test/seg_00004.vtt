00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.674 line:85.83%,end
Gye Bun-ok! Give me that radio.

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:02.427 line:85.83%,end
Give me the radio.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.681 line:85.83%,end
Give me the radio now!

00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:08.642 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.332 line:85.83%,end
Do you even know what you've done?

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.293 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-ya should've come back--

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:41.466 line:85.83%,end
Do you know my sister?

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:49.224 line:85.83%,end
This is Yeon-ok, my older sister.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.937 line:85.83%,end
How do you two know each other?

00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:58.317 line:85.83%,end
We met abroad. That's all.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.402 line:85.83%,end
Why did you keep it from me?

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:02.779 line:85.83%,end
You must've met in Germany.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:07.492 line:85.83%,end
You knew I was her sister all along,
didn't you?

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.704 line:85.83%,end
Why did you pretend not to know?

00:22:10.787 --> 00:22:12.539 line:85.83%,end
Because she spied for the North?

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.708 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.919 line:85.83%,end
You knew about that from the start.

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.297 line:85.83%,end
You still hired me.

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:33.769 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me…

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:40.317 line:85.83%,end
Are you a Northern spy like my sister?

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:42.611 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:46.198 line:85.83%,end
Your sister and I never spied
for the North!

00:22:49.117 --> 00:22:50.577 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean?

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:56.249 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean by that? Tell me!

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:00.212 line:85.83%,end
Keep it down.

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:04.549 line:85.83%,end
All of us getting out safely
is more important right now.

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:08.136 line:85.83%,end
My smart sister Yeon-ok was a traitor

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:10.889 line:85.83%,end
who studied in Germany
on a government scholarship

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:14.476 line:85.83%,end
but fell head over heels for some commie
and even went to Pyongyang.

00:23:14.976 --> 00:23:16.019 line:85.83%,end
That's what they said.

00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:17.396 line:85.83%,end
That's not true!

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.730 line:85.83%,end
It was

00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:22.067 line:85.83%,end
Professor Choi Seong-muk
who went to Pyongyang, not that man.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.487 line:85.83%,end
He was accused of espionage only
because he was the professor's student!

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.989 line:85.83%,end
That was the only reason the young man,

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.784 line:85.83%,end
who was against the dictatorship,
was framed!

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:36.623 line:85.83%,end
How do you know so well
about my sister's boyfriend?

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.959 line:85.83%,end
Because he was my fiancé.

00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:53.640 line:85.83%,end
Are you satisfied?

00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:57.144 line:85.83%,end
Don't try to only save your own skin.

00:23:58.186 --> 00:24:02.023 line:85.83%,end
You don't care as long as he's powerful
enough to help you? But you know what?

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:06.278 line:85.83%,end
He's the one who tortured your sister.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.286 line:85.83%,end
He's the one who tortured and drove her…

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:17.414 line:85.83%,end
to suicide.

00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:53.241 line:85.83%,end
Why do you keep running to the kitchen
after saying you'd go to the restroom?

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:56.161 line:85.83%,end
My goodness. I already told you.

00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:58.288 line:85.83%,end
I have to go cook chicken soup.

00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.291 line:85.83%,end
He must be hungry.

00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:03.960 line:85.83%,end
Fine, okay. Just sit down.

00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:05.295 line:85.83%,end
-Sit.
-Goodness.

00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:06.379 line:85.83%,end
Stay seated.

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:11.718 line:85.83%,end
Don't tie too tightly.

00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:15.764 line:85.83%,end
Hush!

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:18.475 line:85.83%,end
Hey, it hurts!

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:20.477 line:85.83%,end
This is

00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:23.480 line:85.83%,end
all your doing, isn't it?

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:29.694 line:85.83%,end
The ruling party's Secretary-General
working with his mistress

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:31.947 line:85.83%,end
to siphon off the ANSP's secret funds?

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.913 line:85.83%,end
If candidate Park Mu-yeol wins
the presidential election

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.749 line:85.83%,end
and this grand scandal breaks…

00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:47.712 line:85.83%,end
that'll bring down Code 1 at once,
won't it?

00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:50.382 line:85.83%,end
Then, candidate Park would be elated.

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:51.925 line:85.83%,end
I mean,

00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:54.844 line:85.83%,end
he really wants to get rid of Code 1
who has too much power.

00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:55.762 line:85.83%,end
Isn't that it?
