EPISODE 15

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.328 line:14.17%,start
We're all going to get out alive, right?

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.253 line:14.17%,start
I'm relieved that my dad will be able

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.799 line:14.17%,start
to make up even a little
for what he did to my friends.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.019 line:14.17%,start
I thought about it,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.902 line:85.83%,end
and it's too dangerous
for you to stay with me until the end.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.711 line:85.83%,end
Soo-ho, I'll stay by your side
until the end.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.057 line:85.83%,end
By the way,

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.104 line:85.83%,end
where are you going to go?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.792 line:85.83%,end
We will…

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.256 line:85.83%,end
meet again, right?

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.652 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.947 line:85.83%,end
As long as we're alive,

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.119 line:85.83%,end
we will…

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.582 line:85.83%,end
meet again someday.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.364 line:85.83%,end
When we meet again…

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.540 line:85.83%,end
I promise

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.876 line:85.83%,end
I'll give you this necklace back.
