00:52:31.857 --> 00:52:33.358 line:85.83%,end
Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon…

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:36.611 line:85.83%,end
You know her, don't you?

00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.155 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:52:41.783 --> 00:52:43.285 line:85.83%,end
I don't know her.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.471 line:85.83%,end
I didn't think you'd really come back.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.063 line:85.83%,end
What's the point
of running with the money?

00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:16.526 line:85.83%,end
I'll always be chased by someone

00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:19.905 line:85.83%,end
trying to kill me.

00:53:22.782 --> 00:53:25.869 line:85.83%,end
That will be like living in a cage.

00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.207 line:85.83%,end
But if it's inevitable,

00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:34.836 line:85.83%,end
I thought two would be better than one.

00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.862 line:85.83%,end
We must take
Eung-cheol and Gyeok-chan too.

00:54:00.946 --> 00:54:04.783 line:85.83%,end
I can't abandon them like our country did.

00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:12.457 line:85.83%,end
Did you think
I'd ask you to leave alone with me?

00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:33.770 line:85.83%,end
With this certificate and password,

00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:36.022 line:85.83%,end
you can withdraw this money too.

00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:38.733 line:85.83%,end
And the password is…

00:54:42.028 --> 00:54:44.948 line:85.83%,end
the date we spent the night together
in that foxhole.

00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:10.015 line:85.83%,end
I've scouted a ship to stow away on.

00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:14.060 line:85.83%,end
A cargo ship departing
from Pyeongtaek Port at 2 a.m.

00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:16.855 line:85.83%,end
At 2 a.m.?

00:55:18.064 --> 00:55:19.524 line:85.83%,end
But that's too tight.

00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:24.195 line:85.83%,end
I should go call Eun Chang-su first.

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.319 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il's been arrested.

00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:06.154 line:85.83%,end
And Gal will be released soon.

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:09.574 line:85.83%,end
Han-na's on her way to the agency
to pick him up.

00:56:09.657 --> 00:56:10.700 line:85.83%,end
That's good.

00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:13.828 line:85.83%,end
It's not bad for us
that Eun Chang-su took over.

00:56:17.832 --> 00:56:18.875 line:85.83%,end
Anyway…

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:20.877 line:85.83%,end
What's wrong with you?

00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:23.213 line:85.83%,end
If you were going to come back,

00:56:23.838 --> 00:56:26.132 line:85.83%,end
why did you knock Han-na out and run?

00:56:30.095 --> 00:56:32.138 line:85.83%,end
If you were so worried about her,

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:34.724 line:85.83%,end
you shouldn't have had her
do such a dangerous job.

00:56:35.517 --> 00:56:38.895 line:85.83%,end
Why did you have her tail me
and complicate things?

00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:46.486 line:85.83%,end
We must leave by midnight no matter what.

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:50.865 line:85.83%,end
Let's tell Ms. Pi to prepare to release
the hostages as soon as Gal arrives.

00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:07.715 line:85.83%,end
We should use the 300 million dollars
as bait to get out of here.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:16.933 line:85.83%,end
As soon as Han-na arrives at the agency,
lock her in the interrogation room.

00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:20.645 line:85.83%,end
And do not let her meet Gal.

00:57:21.354 --> 00:57:22.355 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:57:31.406 --> 00:57:32.407 line:85.83%,end
It's me.
