If you open the way for us
to leave for another country safely,

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:39.456 line:85.83%,end
<i>we will pay you 300 million dollars
for sparing our lives.</i>

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:44.586 line:85.83%,end
In return,

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:48.715 line:85.83%,end
<i>tell the North that you've killed us
and retrieved the money.</i>

00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:52.886 line:85.83%,end
It's a win-win.
The North will not chase us.

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:56.014 line:85.83%,end
<i>And you'll be able to pay the North
the 300 million dollars.</i>

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:59.267 line:85.83%,end
You'll be the one
making the scheme a success.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:01.769 line:85.83%,end
What do you say?

00:58:02.729 --> 00:58:04.022 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:08.902 line:85.83%,end
Okay. For you guys to leave safely,

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:11.988 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll have the SWAT team back off</i>

00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.656 line:85.83%,end
<i>and get a car ready.</i>

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.075 line:85.83%,end
Come out through the shrine
in five minutes.

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:19.787 line:85.83%,end
We'll leave after releasing
all of the hostages.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.541 line:85.83%,end
So set up cameras
in front of the main gate

00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:25.460 line:85.83%,end
and bring the parents now.

00:58:26.878 --> 00:58:30.423 line:85.83%,end
But the situation has changed
since you intercepted the money.

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:36.429 line:85.83%,end
<i>The President has ordered to send in
the SWAT team to capture you right away.</i>

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.890 line:85.83%,end
So I need some time

00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:41.643 line:85.83%,end
to persuade him.

00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:46.022 line:85.83%,end
I'll give you until midnight.

00:58:46.105 --> 00:58:47.273 line:85.83%,end
<i>I can't give you more.</i>

00:58:47.774 --> 00:58:48.733 line:85.83%,end
In return,

00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:51.819 line:85.83%,end
when you release the hostages,

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.697 line:85.83%,end
release my daughter too.

00:58:57.659 --> 00:59:00.245 line:85.83%,end
<i>Now that you have 300 million
in your possession,</i>

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.498 line:85.83%,end
<i>you don't need
to keep holding her hostage.</i>

00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:08.169 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:59:09.754 --> 00:59:11.839 line:85.83%,end
I'll release her with the others.

00:59:13.591 --> 00:59:18.012 line:85.83%,end
At 00:00 sharp,
come out through the shrine.

00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:32.735 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.644 line:85.83%,end
Where did I put my lawbook?

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:08.771 line:85.83%,end
Come on, Gyeong-ja.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.983 line:85.83%,end
Get it together.
You can't pass the bar like this.

01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:17.905 line:85.83%,end
Where did I put the book?
It must be in here.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.575 line:85.83%,end
Where on earth is it?

01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:23.661 line:85.83%,end
Here it is.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.609 line:85.83%,end

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.071 line:85.83%,end
Eliminate the agents including Lim Soo-ho

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.239 line:85.83%,end
and return with Moran Hill.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:05.036 line:85.83%,end

Over.
