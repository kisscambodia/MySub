00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.469 line:85.83%,end
<i>Send the SWAT team into the dorm.</i>

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.055 line:85.83%,end
Without anyone finding out,

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.642 line:85.83%,end
get my daughter out of there.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.022 line:85.83%,end
Even if you have to break her legs.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.649 line:85.83%,end
You must

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:19.402 line:85.83%,end
get her out.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.447 line:85.83%,end
And as soon as she's out,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.827 line:85.83%,end
blow up the dorm.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.496 line:85.83%,end
Honey, about the 13 people.

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:32.248 line:85.83%,end
That's 13 people.

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:39.922 line:85.83%,end
I know. I know I'm being absurd
asking you to do this.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.886 line:85.83%,end
But I'd do anything
to make you the President.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.513 line:85.83%,end
Have you already forgotten?

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:55.021 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il tried to kill you.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.111 line:85.83%,end
First,

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.281 line:85.83%,end
let's reassure them

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.742 line:85.83%,end
by turning the dorm's power back on.

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.371 line:85.83%,end
And I'll go to the camp

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.124 line:85.83%,end
and blow up the dorm myself.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.250 line:85.83%,end
Understood, sir.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.086 line:85.83%,end
And sir,

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.132 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam's been taken to the agency.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.135 line:85.83%,end
Nam, why?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.974 line:85.83%,end
<i>Back in my KCIA days,</i>

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.771 line:85.83%,end
we used to even arrest
and torture incumbent assemblymen.

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.606 line:85.83%,end
Just because

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.150 line:85.83%,end
our agency was renamed to the ANSP

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.694 line:85.83%,end
doesn't mean we can't torture

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:46.739 line:85.83%,end
or even kill
the ruling party's Secretary-General.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.574 line:85.83%,end
Whether you torture

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.785 line:85.83%,end
or kill me,

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.954 line:85.83%,end
let's talk alone.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:55.540 line:85.83%,end
I'm still Nam Tae-il,
the general who used to lead armies!

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.628 line:85.83%,end
Guys!

00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.547 line:85.83%,end
Our intrepid general

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.007 line:85.83%,end
doesn't want to lose face.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.563 line:85.83%,end
Listen, Chief An.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:24.110 line:85.83%,end
You know our peckers just do what they do.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.280 line:85.83%,end
I had no idea that teasing wench

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.323 line:85.83%,end
was a Northern spy.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.871 line:85.83%,end
According to
the National Security Law 4-2,

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.874 line:85.83%,end
you should be sentenced
to death or life in prison!

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.208 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.836 line:85.83%,end
You know we're almost there.
We're about to win.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.548 line:85.83%,end
You and I must work together
to help the government regain power

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:49.719 line:85.83%,end
and secure peace and prosperity back
to our country, the Republic of Korea!

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.139 line:85.83%,end
You and I must work together?

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.265 line:85.83%,end
That's right.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.816 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you use to call me a dung fly?

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:07.570 line:85.83%,end
How could a dung fly

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.822 line:85.83%,end
and a tiger work together?

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.868 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:17.830 line:85.83%,end
Don't you know a dung fly is
stronger than a tiger?

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.667 line:85.83%,end
If a dung fly flies
towards a tiger's nose,

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.211 line:85.83%,end
the tiger hits

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:28.299 line:85.83%,end
his own face with its paws
to try to catch the dung fly,

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:32.637 line:85.83%,end
and it ends up with deep wounds
made by its own claws!

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.058 line:85.83%,end
Listen to this bastard.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.563 line:85.83%,end
So are you saying

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.274 line:85.83%,end
I'll still be a dung fly no matter what?

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.654 line:85.83%,end
My God! My back…

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.616 line:85.83%,end
My back hurts.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.704 line:85.83%,end
No, that's not what I meant!

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.623 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:05.169 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure you've heard
of the Lord of the Flies. Right?

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:07.088 line:85.83%,end
The Lord of the Flies!

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:11.008 line:85.83%,end
I'm saying you're the man in power!

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.972 line:85.83%,end
This bastard…

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:16.889 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.266 line:85.83%,end
The Lord of the Flies?

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.601 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.103 line:85.83%,end
Your wife says it's urgent.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:32.738 line:85.83%,end
Hey. I'm quite busy
interrogating Nam Tae-il. What is it?

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:36.367 line:85.83%,end
<i>Didn't you say you checked
with ABK Partners about Linda Young?</i>

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.078 line:85.83%,end
But they say she's never been to Seoul!

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.664 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you check? Are you an idiot?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.083 line:85.83%,end
She's never been to Seoul?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.669 line:85.83%,end
I only checked if there was a Linda Young.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:50.089 line:85.83%,end
And the fortuneteller vanished
into thin air, that charlatan!

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.883 line:85.83%,end
<i>What do we do now? We're doomed!</i>

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.844 line:85.83%,end
Vanished into thin air?

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.471 line:85.83%,end
What about the money?

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.682 line:85.83%,end
What happened to the company funds?
