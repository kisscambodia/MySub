<i>At 22:00 sharp, we will blow up the dorm.</i>

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:09.534 line:85.83%,end
<i>All units, evacuate. I repeat.</i>

<i>At 22:00 sharp, we will blow up the dorm.</i>

00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:15.039 line:85.83%,end
<i>All units, evacuate.</i>

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.110 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:52.827 line:85.83%,end
There are no cameras.

00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.371 line:85.83%,end
And there are no parents.

00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:59.500 line:85.83%,end
I haven't heard from your father yet
that he arrived.

00:32:01.794 --> 00:32:02.879 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:06.883 line:85.83%,end
It's because my dad hasn't come yet that
there's no sign of any of them, right?

00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:11.220 line:85.83%,end
The dorm must blow up at midnight

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.640 line:85.83%,end
to save your sister.

00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:22.523 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.944 line:85.83%,end
Nothing's going to happen
to my sister tonight.

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:30.406 line:85.83%,end
Really?

00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:56.182 line:85.83%,end
I'm finally accomplishing my mission.

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:07.652 line:85.83%,end
Put your gun down.

00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:15.368 line:85.83%,end
Put your gun down.

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:43.146 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:46.941 line:85.83%,end
Your target is me, not Yeong-ro.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.278 line:85.83%,end
Let her go up to the second floor.

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.780 line:85.83%,end
They're all going to die anyway.

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.991 line:85.83%,end
You'll kill the hostages
and blow yourself up?

00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:57.160 line:85.83%,end
If you die that way,

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.455 line:85.83%,end
you think you'll be awarded
the Hero of the Republic?

00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:05.460 line:85.83%,end
My mother will be safe at least.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.837 line:85.83%,end
You should be the one
keeping your mother safe.

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:11.966 line:85.83%,end
You must stay alive no matter what
and find a way to save her.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.843 line:85.83%,end
The party's abandoned us.

00:34:15.803 --> 00:34:17.221 line:85.83%,end
You think they'll look after her?

00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:18.723 line:85.83%,end
It's all your fault.

00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:21.142 line:85.83%,end
You ruined everything!

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:23.186 line:85.83%,end
-If only you hadn't come here--
-Shut up!

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:27.148 line:85.83%,end
You're the one who disobeyed me
and followed me here.

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.566 line:85.83%,end
No!

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:34.405 line:85.83%,end
I was just following the orders
to keep a close eye on you.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.077 line:85.83%,end
On whose orders?

00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:43.664 line:85.83%,end
Who ordered you to keep a close eye on me?

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.716 line:85.83%,end
And my superior ordered to kill you
this time too.

00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:57.720 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.272 line:85.83%,end
Goodbye, Lim Soo-ho.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.882 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang.

00:35:48.354 --> 00:35:49.689 line:85.83%,end
What time is it?
