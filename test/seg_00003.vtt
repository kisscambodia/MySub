<i>The North told Soo-ho
they'd kill his sister if he doesn't</i>

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.375 line:85.83%,end
blow up the hostages and himself
by midnight.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.711 line:85.83%,end
So you must get back in!

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.365 line:85.83%,end
In any case,

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.203 line:85.83%,end
it's a relief that we've saved
your sister from Lim Ji-rok.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.252 line:85.83%,end
It's too early to be relieved.

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.548 line:85.83%,end
The dorm must blow up at midnight

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:33.969 line:85.83%,end
as if we've blown ourselves up
for the North to be completely fooled.

00:17:35.637 --> 00:17:38.640 line:85.83%,end
And we need Eun Chang-su
to tell the North we've killed ourselves.

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:41.769 line:85.83%,end
But will he?

00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:47.232 line:85.83%,end
I doubt Eun's put aside
his desire for power in this situation.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.655 line:85.83%,end
If only Kang Cheong-ya came back…

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.910 line:85.83%,end
We shouldn't have trusted her.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.584 line:85.83%,end
Anyway,

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.004 line:85.83%,end
if Eun is pretending
to have changed his mind,

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:14.510 line:85.83%,end
he'll kill or take the hostages
to the ANSP even if they're released.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.139 line:85.83%,end
I don't know if this can stop it,

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.809 line:85.83%,end
but once the cameras are set up,
Gal is released,

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:25.479 line:85.83%,end
<i>and the parents have arrived,
release all the hostages.</i>

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.232 line:85.83%,end
<i>Once all of them are out,</i>

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.860 line:85.83%,end
<i>my agents and I will get out
with Yeong-ro.</i>

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.240 line:85.83%,end
Release them?

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:39.535 line:85.83%,end
Then they'll tell people
that I helped the spies.

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:45.040 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.129 line:85.83%,end
A foreign woman in her 30s.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:51.880 line:85.83%,end
Blonde hair and about 170cm tall.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.509 line:85.83%,end
Tell Airport Security and Customs.
We must catch her!

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.390 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is Gye Bun-ok.</i>

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.642 line:85.83%,end
Now of all times?

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:05.435 line:85.83%,end
What is it?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.772 line:85.83%,end
The spies are planning
to release the hostages.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:11.275 line:85.83%,end
<i>You know I'm anti-communist to the bone.</i>

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:15.112 line:85.83%,end
I'm the one who told you
that Kang Cheong-ya is a Northern spy!

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:18.574 line:85.83%,end
Listen carefully.

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.994 line:85.83%,end
If you contact me again,

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.664 line:85.83%,end
I will kill you.

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.875 line:85.83%,end
So keep your mouth shut and wait.
Understood?

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:32.838 line:85.83%,end
That damn bastard.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:34.673 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An!

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:42.222 line:85.83%,end
We've found out that Kang Cheong-ya made
an international call from her house.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:46.185 line:85.83%,end
It was to Swiss BR Bank's Tokyo branch.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.605 line:85.83%,end
Swiss BR Bank? Kang Cheong-ya called them?

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.524 line:85.83%,end
Then Linda was…

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.238 line:85.83%,end
Linda?

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:03.994 line:85.83%,end
That damn bastard. He found out
about Kang Cheong-ya thanks to me.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:08.832 line:85.83%,end
Did you tell him…

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:15.255 line:85.83%,end
that Kang is a Northern spy
with that radio?

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.552 line:85.83%,end
What is it? You've spied for the ANSP,

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.846 line:85.83%,end
but you don't approve of others doing it?

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.641 line:85.83%,end
-You have no idea what he's--
-I know he's powerful.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.893 line:85.83%,end
I don't care if he's ANSP or not,

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:31.438 line:85.83%,end
as long as he's capable of helping me.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:37.819 line:85.83%,end
I told you not to dare
to think about only saving your skin.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.823 line:85.83%,end
What's so wrong with that?

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:46.161 line:85.83%,end
What can you do to end this anyway?

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.831 line:85.83%,end
You can't even save one person,
so stop lecturing me.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:51.917 line:85.83%,end
It's starting to bug me.
