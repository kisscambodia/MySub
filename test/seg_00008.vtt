00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.130 line:85.83%,end
for our country!

00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:08.799 line:85.83%,end
For our country, my foot.

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:11.260 line:85.83%,end
Shut your trap, will you?

00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:13.387 line:85.83%,end
What are you guys waiting for?

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.763 line:85.83%,end
Arrest all of them!

00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:17.933 line:85.83%,end
Be quiet, woman!
How dare you order them around?

00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:21.437 line:85.83%,end
Han-na.

00:41:22.563 --> 00:41:23.898 line:85.83%,end
Get rid of them.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.358 line:85.83%,end
No, you won't!

00:41:26.442 --> 00:41:27.485 line:85.83%,end
Look.

00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:30.154 line:85.83%,end
You got shot trying
to rescue your daughter

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:32.907 line:85.83%,end
who fell for a damn commie.
Don't pin this on me!

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:37.077 line:85.83%,end
I've always been loyal to our country.
I've done nothing wrong!

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:41.373 line:85.83%,end
I have nothing to be ashamed of
before our country and people!

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.295 line:85.83%,end
God damn it.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.721 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.104 line:85.83%,end
-No!
-No!

00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:18.369 line:85.83%,end
My God! You!

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.291 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:07.835 line:85.83%,end
I'll kill you.

00:43:09.878 --> 00:43:11.130 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.008 line:85.83%,end
-Let go of me!
-Stop it.

00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:16.510 line:85.83%,end
Can't you see how he beat me up?

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:19.597 line:85.83%,end
He even tried to kill you.
Why are you treating his wound?

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:22.016 line:85.83%,end
That's enough.

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.524 line:85.83%,end
That's enough. Eung-cheol.

00:43:32.568 --> 00:43:33.694 line:85.83%,end
Look at me, Eung-cheol.

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:36.655 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:43.829 line:85.83%,end
Now that Comrade Kang's here
with the 300 million dollars,

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.291 line:85.83%,end
we should focus on getting out alive.

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:51.503 line:85.83%,end
With that money, we'll be able to rescue

00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:53.964 line:85.83%,end
our families in the North.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.931 line:85.83%,end
If you run with the money,
do you think the party will let you live?

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.518 line:85.83%,end
They will hunt down you traitors

00:44:07.519 --> 00:44:09.813 line:85.83%,end
and kill you mercilessly.

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.484 line:85.83%,end
You goddamn bastard. I'll kill you.

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:14.610 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:16.904 line:85.83%,end
We'll leave him here.

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:21.325 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:24.620 line:85.83%,end
Leave him here.

00:44:30.876 --> 00:44:34.421 line:85.83%,end
You… Do you really want to die in here?

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.093 line:85.83%,end
You and I are in the same boat.

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:43.305 line:85.83%,end
You want to die here
and be displayed to people?

00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:45.933 line:85.83%,end
And if your body is humiliated,

00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:49.061 line:85.83%,end
our country will look the other way.

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:51.605 line:85.83%,end
They won't do anything.

00:44:53.273 --> 00:44:56.485 line:85.83%,end
Because they can't admit
to the presidential election scheme.

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.910 line:85.83%,end
If you kill Soo-ho as ordered,

00:45:08.163 --> 00:45:10.833 line:85.83%,end
do you think
Choi Su-ryeon will take care of you?

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:12.918 line:85.83%,end
Do you?

00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:19.842 line:85.83%,end
To her, you are…

00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:26.682 line:85.83%,end
nothing but a pawn on her chessboard.

00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.778 line:85.83%,end
Choi Su-ryeon?

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:45.200 line:85.83%,end
The deputy director of the MSS
is Comrade Joo's superior.

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.166 line:85.83%,end
You mean…

00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:55.711 line:85.83%,end
the daughter of Choi Du-ik,
the former Minister of PAF?

00:45:59.715 --> 00:46:00.924 line:85.83%,end
Do you know her?
