01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.394 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry.

01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:14.690 line:85.83%,end
You know too that we're never going to

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.317 line:85.83%,end
see each other again.

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:24.282 line:85.83%,end
-Soo-hoâ€¦
-Don't wait for me.

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:29.705 line:85.83%,end
The moment I leave this dormâ€¦

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:34.000 line:85.83%,end
I'll forget you exist.

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:55.100 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. You're hurting me!

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.893 line:85.83%,end
Why do you keep pinching me?

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:08.381 line:85.83%,end
Sir!

01:22:09.215 --> 01:22:10.133 line:85.83%,end
Sir!

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.393 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Kim is suspicious.

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:23.647 line:85.83%,end
I heard him radio someone
in the records room.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:25.482 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean?

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.317 line:85.83%,end
Radio?

01:22:28.693 --> 01:22:31.237 line:85.83%,end
"Eliminate the agents including Lim Soo-ho

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:33.365 line:85.83%,end
and return with Moran Hill."

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.117 line:85.83%,end
Are you sure?

01:22:36.826 --> 01:22:38.119 line:85.83%,end
Eliminate Lim Soo-ho?

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.663 line:85.83%,end
And the others too?

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.415 line:85.83%,end
Yes. I heard it clearly.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:46.670 line:85.83%,end
And I heard him order someone
to get a vehicle ready by the shrine.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:49.631 line:85.83%,end
Where is he?

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:51.216 line:85.83%,end
I think he's trying to leave the dorm.

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:53.468 line:85.83%,end
I saw him going down to the records room.

01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:10.819 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up.
