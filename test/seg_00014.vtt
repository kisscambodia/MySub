01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:10.135 line:85.83%,end
It is…

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:14.807 line:85.83%,end
my job to save the students anyway.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:26.151 line:85.83%,end
Han-na's picking Gal up.
So don't worry, and just go.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:33.575 line:85.83%,end
I hope…

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.705 line:85.83%,end
we never meet again.

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:29.882 line:85.83%,end
You have five minutes.

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:01.497 line:85.83%,end
We have to leave first to catch a ship.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.968 line:85.83%,end
Stay here,
and when the hostages are released,

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:17.346 line:85.83%,end
go with them.

01:15:23.727 --> 01:15:24.978 line:85.83%,end
And don't worry about me.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:29.525 line:85.83%,end
They won't kill us
since we have the 300 million dollars.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.487 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:38.075 line:85.83%,end
I'll get out with my friends.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:40.869 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry about me.

01:15:42.454 --> 01:15:44.248 line:85.83%,end
And be safe.

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:11.358 line:85.83%,end
I should go.

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.194 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:37.342 line:85.83%,end
This is…

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.178 line:85.83%,end
You know

01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:43.515 line:85.83%,end
how much this scarf means to me, right?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.105 line:85.83%,end
It's really precious to me.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:53.775 line:85.83%,end
So next time we meet…

01:16:56.486 --> 01:17:00.574 line:85.83%,end
If we meet again,
you have to give it back to me.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.561 line:85.83%,end
Why…

01:17:30.854 --> 01:17:31.855 line:85.83%,end
Why?

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.487 line:85.83%,end
If I take it,

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:42.741 line:85.83%,end
I can never give it back.

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:51.625 line:85.83%,end
But you…

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.004 line:85.83%,end
You said we'll meet again.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.886 line:85.83%,end
You said we'll meet again someday

01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:06.223 line:85.83%,end
as long as we're alive.
