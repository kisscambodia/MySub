Why are you following me?

17
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,879
I wasn't asking you,

18
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,520
what are you doing here?

19
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,039
You give up work of Yutian?

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,839
Yes, I gave up.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,039
I don't want to be annoyed
by Lin Xiangyuan.

22
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,000

You don't have to worry about me.
I'm fine.

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,080
But you.

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,679
What?

28
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,160
Siqi, I saw everything.

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,679
What did you see?

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
You mean what happened just now?

31
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,679
He is a friend of Shangguan.

32
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,279
I knew they would come here.

33
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,279
You don't need to mention this anymore.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,960
Siqi, I'm telling you,

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,199
if he dares to bully you,

36
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,080
don't endure it, please.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,919
You have to let me know,
and I'll help you teach him a lesson.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,759
You help me teach him a lesson?

39
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,639
Why?

40
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,039
You'd better mind
your own business first.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,039

42
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,639

I'm doing great.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,679
I'm doing really great.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,240
You don't need to worry about me.

46
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,639
You just take care of yourself
and get a good job.

47
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,320
Didn't you say that
you want to treat me with dinner?

48
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,000
How will you do that?

49
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,199
How can you pay for that?

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,320
At last, I have to pay the bill.

51
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,000
I have to go.

52
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,839
Let me take you home.

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,839
No.

54
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,279
I will call Shangguan.

55
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,759
I will ask him to pick me.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm so sorry for today.

57
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,360
Wasn't He Qunfei working in Yutian?

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Why does he work here for you?

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,440
I heard that Mr. Lin of Yutian
can’t tolerate him.

60
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,839
So, I asked him to work here.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,199
He just started the job today.

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,639
I didn't expect that he was such a fool.

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,679
Don't be angry.

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I'll fire him soon.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
It's ok.

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,160
Let him stay here.

67
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,320
He used to be an assistant of my friend.

68
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,960
Now, my friend is in trouble.

69
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,440
He is also implicated.

70
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,160
Forget what happened today.

71
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,520
But he already quit.

72
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,199
Then, get him back.

73
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:42,959
Dad.

74
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,200
Dad.

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,079
Here,

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
take a sip.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,720
I still have to remind you

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,640
that you're nothing now.

Mr. Lei's favorite marshmallow.

82

It's so cold outside.

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320

for a long time.

84

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,519

92
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,000
let her in.

93
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Let her go.

97
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,239
Ok.

Duan, why are you taking so long?

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,519
Let marshmallow in!

101
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,119
So?

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,279
May I come in?

104
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,959
would you please
stop treating your dad like that?

105
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,559
Let me in.

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,959
Lei Yuzheng!

107
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,480
Why? You have to make it clear to me.

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,679
I'm so sorry, Miss Du.

109
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,679
I can't let you in.

would you please

112
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,119
take these to Mr. Lei?

113
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
Please let him eat less.

114
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,519
Never let him eat too much.

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,600
Miss Du!

116
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,279
Please tell Lei Yuzheng,

119
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,760
I hear that there are big layoffs
in our company.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,920
I wonder if it will be our turn.

121
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,279
Since Mr. Lin came,

122
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,079
our company is in a mess.

123
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,160
Besides, the assistant Xie...

124
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,000
You're right.

125
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,920
If only Mr. Lei were here.

126
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,679

Manager Xie,

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
I think it's too hard for me.

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,599
Zhang,

131
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,400
do you know why Mr. Lin and I

132
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,679
can get here step by step?

133
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,760
Because we

134
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,400
"talk less and do more work".

135
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,799
I don't care how you do it,

136
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,440
just fire these people right now.

I heard Lei Yuzheng will be back.

142

Mr. Lin laid off so many staff.

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,599
Is it because he is afraid of us?

144
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,280
Xia, what are you thinking about?

145
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,919
Lei Yuzheng can do nothing at all.

146
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,359
As you can see,
since Mr. Lei is so sick,

147
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,880
Lei Yuzheng is now tied up with

148
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,880
taking care of him.

149
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,760
If anything more serious happens
to his father,

150
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,359
Lei Yuzheng would be done.

151
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,760
Then, why did Mr. Lin do that?

152
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
He's making people so nervous.

153
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,919
Every new sovereign
brings his own courtiers.

154
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,719
Since Mr. Jiang is not in power
any more,

155
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,640
it is for sure that Mr. Lin wants to
use people on his own side.

156
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:46,400
Xia, even though
you are on Mr. Jiang's side,

157
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,679
there's still the chance
that Lin may lay you off one day.

158
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,559
How dare he! My length of service
is even longer than his time of life.

To this company,

160
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,359
I at least deserve credit for efforts.

161
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,799
If he is so unreasonable,

162
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,479
I will talk with Mr. Jiang about it.

163
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
Lay off Xia!

164
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,000

who depend on their seniority.

00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:39,936
(Lei Yuzheng)

188
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:45,728
(Du Xiaosu)

189
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,719
Hello, Qunfei.

190
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,440
I have been unable to reach Lei Yuzheng.

191
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,880
Has something happened to him?

192
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,239
Isn't that Mr. Lei from Yutian group?

193
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,400
Isn't the boss of Yutian Group
surnamed "Lin"?

194
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,679
You didn't know.

195
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,159
When Mr. Lei

196
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,039
was not in trouble,

197
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,320
he was the dream of all women.

198
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,440
He used to have many fans and followers.
(He Qunfei)

199
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,479
Now,

200
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,440
he is in trouble.

201
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,760
But,

202
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,599
a sleeping lion is stronger than
a barking dog.

203
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,479
Hello, Mr. Lei.

204
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,719
My name is Linda.

205
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,640
May I buy you a drink?

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,239
Seems that Mr. Lei likes alcohol, right?

207
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,520
Waiter,

208
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,239
a row of depth charges here.

209
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:53,599
Xiaosu.

210
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,200
Xiaosu.

211
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,039
Qunfei, here you are.

212
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,919
What's wrong with Lei Yuzheng recently?

213
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,080
I have called him for a few days.

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,960
He didn't answer.

215
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,559
He didn't let me in his house, either.

216
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,320
Even he loses his temper,

217
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,840
he should pick another time.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,599
Mr. Lei is just a little better.

219
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,119
What if he were to suffer
any further irritations.

220
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,679
What can we do?

221
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,239
Would you please call him again?

222
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,479
-Come on.
-Come on.

223
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:24,280
-Come on.
-Come on.

224
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,479
-Come on.
-Come on.

225
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,248
(He Qunfei)

226
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,320
Hello, Mr. Lei.

227
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:34,919
Who is that?

228
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,400
We are in Phoebe.

229
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,840
You, go there.

230
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,239
Come on,  no talking.

231
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,239
Drink!

232
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,479
Lei Yuzheng.

233
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,039
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for someone else.

234
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,280
Wait, lady.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,679
You didn't mistake me. Come.

236
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,320
You didn't.

237
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:05,799
No.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,119
Have a drink together.

239
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,520
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,280
I did mistake you for someone else.

241
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,599
I'm so sorry.

242
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,919
-Come on.
-Come on.

243
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,119
Come here.

244
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,039
Drink.

245
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,119
Lei Yuzheng.

246
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,239
Lady,

247
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,760
we met again by fate.

248
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,039
Let's have a drink.

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,039
Have a drink.

250
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,760
Excuse me.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,599
Excuse me.

252
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,520
Where are you going?

253
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,359
No offense.

254
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Just have a drink.

255
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
What are you doing?

256
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,440
Have a drink.

257
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,760
Let go of me. Let me go.

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
What are you two doing?

259
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,239
Don't leave. Have a drink.

260
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,239
What are you doing?

261
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,080
Come on. Have a drink.

262
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
Let go. You, let go of me.

263
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,760
What do you want?

264
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,880
Come on. Have a drink.

265
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,599
Stop it.

266
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,159
Stop it.

267
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,080
Lei Yuzheng.

268
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Stop it, Lei Yuzheng.

269
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,919
Go.

270
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,760
Yuzheng,

271
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,719
let's go home.

272
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,479
Why do I have to go home with you?

273
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,000
I just couldn't stand
those two bastards.

274
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,679
Don't think that I was helping you.

275
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
It's none of your business here.

276
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm busy. Go away.

277
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,880
Go.

278
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,479
Why did you do that?

279
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,880
What?

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
What should I do to you?

281
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,320
Should I send them away

282
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,599
and have you drink with me?

283
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Why is she crying?

284
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,520
How come a girl like you

285
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
dares to play with our Mr. Lei.

286
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,000
No wonder you were dumped.

287
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,799
Mr. Lei.

288
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Finally, I found you.

289
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
You even have a back-up?

290
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
How can you say that?

291
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,719
Why are you with such a person?

292
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,159
Since when who am I with

293
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,599
is any of your business?

294
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:33,719
Leave them alone.

295
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,760
Lei Yuzheng, you are a jerk.

296
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,880
Yes, I'm a jerk.

297
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
You're right, Du Xiaosu.

298
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,679
Take it easy.
With you, I am not serious at all.

299
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,599
What?

300
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,000
Do you really love me?

301
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,320
Wake up.

302
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,719
Go.

303
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,599
Xiaosu.

304
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,239
Let's go.

305
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Go away.

306
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,680
Such a jerk. What's the matter with you?

307
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
What's the matter with you?

308
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Wanhua.

309
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,680
Marshmallow.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yuzheng. Wanhua.

311
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,199
Marshmallow.

312
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,319
Mr. Lei.

313
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,079
Mr. Lei.

314
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,839
Mr. Lei.

315
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,520
Mr. Lei.

316
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,439
You really shouldn't do that
to Du Xiaosu.

317
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,280
When you were in prison,

318
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,079
if it wasn't because of her,

319
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,160
I'm afraid your father would...

320
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,760
I'm a jerk.

321
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,880
Take it easy.
With you, I am not serious at all.

322
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,079
What?

323
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,079
Do you really love me?

324
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,119
Wake up.

325
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,719
Many times,

326
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,719
the hospital issued a critical notice.

327
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,640
We didn't tell you.

328
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,479
It was Du Xiaosu to handle everything.

329
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,239
She was very busy and tired.

330
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,119
She found the best doctor
for your father.

331
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,479
That's the reason why he was able to
recover to what he is now.

332
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
Even if you don't appreciate her,

333
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,800
you shouldn't have hurt her at least.

334
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,959
I don't know what you are thinking.

335
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Mr. Lei,

336
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,359
are you ok? Have you got hurt?

337
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,000
Where is Yuzheng?

338
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,479
I…

339
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
Mr. Lei. Please, don't...

340
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,680
I... what's wrong with me?

341
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:54,359
It's so hard to get out of bed.

342
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,359
Mr. Lei.

343
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,800
You are...

344
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,040
Duan.

345
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:06,959
Why do you talk in such a weird way?

346
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
Mr. Lei.

347
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,880
Make a call to Yuzheng.

348
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,560
I have called him in the morning.

349
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,839
He should be back.

350
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're right.

351
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,800
He went to the police station
just to answer some questions, right?

352
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,839
Yes.

353
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,760
It should have finished.

354
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,760
What are you doing?

355
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,199
Hurry up, call him.

356
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,760
I'll call him right away.

357
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:28,800
I will make the call.

358
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,319
Mr. Lei, you come to yourself.

359
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,439
Mr. Lei.

360
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,839
Great. Great. Mr. Lei comes to himself.

361
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,520
Mr. Lei comes to himself.

362
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,119
-Hello.
-Mr. Lei comes to himself.

363
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:50,808
(WeChat. He Qunfei)

364
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:51,904
(Mr. Lei comes to himself!)

365
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,640
I just fell down.

366
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,040
It doesn't matter.

367
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,880
How can it not matter?

368
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,359
Your son is very worried about you.

369
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,280
My son. For these years,

370
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,640
you've suffered a lot.

371
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:26,319
Dad did not take good care of you.

372
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Dad, it's my fault.

373
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,199
I didn't take good care of you.

374
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,439
I was so unfilial.

375
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,079
I can't maintain Yutian.

376
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,239
It is not important.

377
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
You're back, now.

378
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,199
This is the most important.

379
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,199
It is the most important that
Mr. Lei comes to himself.

380
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,760
Yuzheng,

381
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,640
I have one thing

382
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,079
in mind for many years.

383
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,599
I have to tell you.

384
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,119
My son.

385
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,160
In fact, it wasn't your mother's fault.

386
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,280
It was my fault.

387
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,400
I failed your mom.

388
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,760
Dad,

389
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,800
those things are in the past,

390
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,880
and can never go back.

391
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,239
Forget it.

392
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:43,439
In future, I will be with you.

393
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,239
I will not go anywhere.

394
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,319
Son.

395
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,079
These years,

396
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,880
I always hated myself,

397
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,160
as I didn't give you a complete home.

398
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,680
Dad, it's the past.

399
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,239
Forget it.

400
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,599
This is dad's Yutian.

401
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,119
It's also your Yutian.

402
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,239
We have to

403
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,079
keep it and build it

404
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,199
Let it be

405
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,479
the most magnificent building.

406
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,160
Yuzheng,

407
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,319
the ground you're standing on

408
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,359
is our business

409
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,199
and destiny.

410
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,280
Dad.

411
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,719
Dad.

412
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,479
Dad.

413
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,040
What's going on, dad?

414
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,439
Wake up.

415
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:51,079
Dad, wake up.

416
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,359
Dad.

417
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Dad.

418
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,280
You need to start shaving.

419
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,119
Don't move.

420
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't move. Be careful.

421
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,199
Why don't you try it?

422
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,040
Ignore him.

423
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,800
Ok, I will let marshmallow to do it.

424
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,680
How is it?

425
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
She is better than you.

426
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,800
How do you know since I haven't tried?

427
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
It's my fault.

428
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,680
I didn't take good care of you.

429
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,920
I am unfilial.

430
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,920
I can't maintain Yutian.

431
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,719
It is not important.

432
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,479
You're back, now.
This is the most important.

433
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,479
Look forward and keep moving.

434
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,119
Mr. Lei, I am so sorry.

435
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,040
Don't be so sad.

436
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,040
Stand up.

437
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,680
Don't cry.

438
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
The Leis never cry when they fall.

439
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,439
The Leis never give up.

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,640
I wish I were not your son.

441
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
I don't want this kind of dad.

442
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,280
Now, I'm telling you that,

443
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,119
as long as I'm in the hospital,

444
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,800
you should stay.

445
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,199
Yuzheng,

446
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:26,439
auntie Shao is always your family.

447
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,520
Fanlv, you should not go there.

448
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
How could I?

449
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,599
That's uncle Lei who sees me grow up.

450
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,079
How could I not go?

451
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,439
Fanlv, it's bad luck
for a pregnant woman to go to a funeral.

452
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,719
You go back first.

453
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,800
Mr. Jiang, let me go with you.

454
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,079
No. You don't have to.

455
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,959
Just stay with Fanlv.

456
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,000
Dad.

457
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,119
Lei.

458
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,000
You

459
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
didn't keep your word.

460
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,040
We have made a deal.

461
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
After retirement,

462
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
we will learn fishing together.

463
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,520
I have prepared the fishing rod for you.

464
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:52,680
How can you just leave like this?

465
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,319
From now on,

466
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,160
no one will play chess with me anymore.

467
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,160
No one will argue with me anymore.

468
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,479
What are you doing here?

469
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,199
You can come but I can't?

470
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,479
I'm here to mourn, too

471
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,640
Go away.

472
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,119
You don't need to be here,
crying crocodile tears.

473
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,239
Yes,

474
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,959
I did have some disputes
with Lei Yuzheng.

475
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,439
But I think

476
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,920
you are the most inappropriate person
to accuse me.

477
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,359
If it weren't because of you,

478
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,439
it wouldn't be like this.

479
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,079
Lin Xiangyuan!

480
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,160
I'll beat up you.

481
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,719
Lin Xiangyuan.

482
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,479
What are you doing, Lin Xiangyuan?

483
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Do you know what day it is today?

484
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,599
Today is the day of Mr. Lei's funeral.

485
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,880
What are you doing here?

486
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,640
How come your morals are so bad?

487
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,719
Xiaosu,

488
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm here to mourn…

489
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,319
Don't talk to me now.

490
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,920
I don't want to see you.

491
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
Please get out.

492
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,560
OK, I'll go.

493
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,680
I can explain to you later.

494
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,680
Dad.

495
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,959
Everyone left.

496
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,400
Now, it's just the two of us.

497
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,239
I want to talk to you.

498
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,400
Can you hear me?

499
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,640
Could you please tell me

500
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,520
what you wanted to tell

501
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,040
before you passed away?

502
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,719
You're back.

503
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,479
How is Yuzheng?

504
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,280
I am asking you.

505
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,040
Why don't you care about me,

506
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,000
but always care about others?

507
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,920
Why not just put Lei Yuzheng
in the bottom of your heart?

508
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,920
You're a jerk.

509
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,800
What are you talking about?

510
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,520
Fanlv.

511
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,239
Fanlv.

512
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,479
Fanlv, are you ok?

513
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,840
Fanlv.

514
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,080
I'll take you to the hospital, Ok?

515
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,959
Let's go to the hospital.

516
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,959
Fanlv.

517
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,239
Fanlv.

518
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,919
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,639
Please, forgive me.

520
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,199
Dad.

521
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,879
Daughter, what happened?

522
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,399
Dad, it is me.

523
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,719
I had a fall myself.

524
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,919
You tell me, Lin Xiangyuan.

525
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,760
What happened?

526
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,120
What happened to the baby?

527
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,040
Dad.

528
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,840
Fanlv fell down accidentally.

529
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,879
Is that true?

530
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,719
Yes, dad.

531
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,719
I don't dare to be  bad to Fanlv.

532
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm telling you, Lin,

533
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,239
you are promoted by me.

534
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
I know your mind too well.

535
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,959
You'd better give Fanlv
your full attention.

536
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,080
Fanlv is my daughter!

537
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,120
If you hurt her,

538
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
I will hunt you down.

539
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,864
(Year 1986, Lei Ting in Shanghai)

540
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,399
March 17. Sunny.

541
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,520
My first date with Wanhua.

542
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,040
I bought the wrong movie ticket.

543
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,000
There was a person between our seats.

544
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,399
She didn't blame me for it.

545
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,600
What a lovely lady!

546
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,199
April 3. Cloudy.

547
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,360
I asked Wanhua to marry me.

548
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,679
Her parents don't agree of
our being together.

549
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:23,600
But I will prove it to them.

550
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,479
We will be perfectly happy,

551
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,040
for the whole life.

552
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,719
August 19. Rainy. Wedding.

553
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,399
Wanhua cried.

554
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,239
She said, all this has not come easily.

555
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,239
December 1. Sunny.

556
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,159
Our son was born.

557
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,159
I named him Yuzheng.

558
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,639
A little man.

559
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,159
From now on,

560
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:59,320
my life is complete.

561
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,320
November 6. Cloudy.

562
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,399
Unhappy.

563
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,320
Is our marriage to Wanhua

564
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,639
really a mistake?

565
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,280
Why did we keep arguing?

566
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,520
Are we really not right for each other?

567
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,760
December 1.

568
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,080
Wanhua quarreled with me again today.

569
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,959
I hit her by mistake.

570
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,560
The rift between us

571
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,879
will be healed in no way.

572
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
January 25.

573
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,360
Wanhua really left me.

574
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,919
Maybe,

575
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,280
this is destiny.

576
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,280
January 26.

577
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,520
I met Wanhua today.

578
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,919
In that moment, time stood still.

579
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,239
I held her hand.

580
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,760
It was cold.

581
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,479
I don't know what to do.

582
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,959
I am not sure what to do with
the rest of my life.

583
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,280
I also don't know

584
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,800
how to face Yuzheng.

585
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,439
February 6.

586
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,000
Heavy snow.

587
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:38,600
I dreamed of Wanhua.

588
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,080
She is as beautiful as ever.

589
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,520
It's like she has never been away.

590
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,600
Honey, you're awake.

591
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,080
Fanlv, I'm taking a day off today

592
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,719
to take care of you.

593
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,479
This soup is your favorite.

594
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,840
Here you are.

595
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,360
It's a little hot.
Let me cool it for you.

596
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,560
Lin Xiangyuan, there is no one at home
but us.

597
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,360
