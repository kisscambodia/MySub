16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,120
Fanlv, I'm taking a day off today

17
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:08,759
to take care of you.

18
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,520
This soup is your favorite.

19
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:14,880
Here you are.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,479
It's a little hot.
Let me cool it for you.

21
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,600
Lin Xiangyuan, there is no one at home.

22
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,399
Stop pretending.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,720
Fanlv,

24
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,440
I sincerely want to apologize to you.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,559
That day, I don't know why

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,639
I beat you.

27
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,960
I promise I'll never do it again.
Trust me.

28
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,639
I love you so much.

29
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,399
But you mentioned
Lei Yuzheng so many times.

30
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,160
I...

31
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,839
Love?

32
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,199
I just want to ask you.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,800
You beat me because of love?

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Don't mention the word "love"
in front of me.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Fanlv,

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
no matter how wrong I was,

37
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,080
I really love you.

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,559
Go away.

39
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,520
Fanlv,

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,399
Please give me a chance.

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,759
Last chance.

43
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,080
Fanlv, have a bite, please.

44
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,880
It's cold by the window.
Let's go inside.

45
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,320
Mrs. Zhao,

46
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,679
do you think Yuzheng

47
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,079
lives a hard life?

48
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,839
You care and love him.

49
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
No matter how much I love him,

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,640
I can't be the same as his own mom.

51
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,480
When Wanhua passed away,

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,839
how little he was!

53
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,519
He was just a kid.

54
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,640
Now, Lei passed away.

55
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,200
Mrs. Zhao, is that Yuzheng?

56
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:20,959
Mrs. Shao.

57
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
Yuzheng.

58
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Yuzheng, it's so cold today.

59
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,839
Don't catch a cold.

60
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,040
Mrs. Zhao, please cook
a bowl of ginger soup.

61
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,799
Aunt Shao,

62
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,320
can you please tell me

63
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,880
whether my mom is still alive?

64
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,799
Why are you asking this?

65
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,079
If you treat me as your own son,

66
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,640
please tell me the truth.

67
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,519
Did you hear or see anything?

68
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,519
Wanhua and I have had no contact
for a long time.

69
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,839
About where is she now,

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,839
no one knows.

71
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,239
You still keep the truth from me.

72
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,839
You have been doing this

73
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,799
for twenty years.

74
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,799
How long are you planning to
keep doing this to me?

75
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,000
My mom,

76
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,160
did she already pass away?

77
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,559
Yuzheng.

78
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,160
You have been keeping the truth
for such a long time.

79
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,200
You don't even feel a little bit guilty?

80
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,440
Yuzheng,

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
I understand that at this moment,

82
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,839
you are not easy to be persuaded.

83
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't want to persuade you, either.

84
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,679
In the past twenty years,

85
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,720
I always wanted to give it to you.

86
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,799
Now, it's the right time.

87
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,648
(Yuzheng)

88
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,959
From now on,

89
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,839
I will not hide anything from you.

90
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,399
No matter what you want to know,

91
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,440
I will tell you.

92
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,559
I still remember that

93
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,239
it was a rainy day.

94
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
What did I do to you?

95
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,640
Out there, you always
pretend to be pitiful.

96
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,959
I can’t stand this kind of life anymore.

97
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,279
If you can't, just leave.

98
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,880
Fine.

99
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,839
I want a divorce.

100
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,160
Divorce? It's you who said that.

101
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,239
Fine. You get out of here right away.

102
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,280
Go away.

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Mom.

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
Mom.

105
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,119
Mom, please don't go.

106
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,840
Mom, please stay.

107
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,359
Zheng.

108
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,119
Yuzheng.

109
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,359
I'll come back to see you.

110
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,039
Mom.

111
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,159
Mom, please don't go.

112
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,679
Yuzheng.

113
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,080
Yuzheng.

114
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,760
Please stay!

115
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,119
Mom, please don't go.

116
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,840
Let me go.

117
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Mom.

118
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,159
Aunt Shao,

119
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,679
I just want to know

120
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,320
where my mom is buried?

121
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,080
Huaxi Cemetery.

122
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,599
Yuzheng,

123
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,799
if you have resentment in your heart,
resent me.

124
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,840
Your dad has been guilty of this
for all his life.

125
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,159
He wished to spend his whole life
to atone for Wanhua.

126
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,119
(Miss Forever)

127
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:30,272
(Tomb of my beloved wife,
Wanhua 1960-1993. Lei Ting)

128
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,000
Mom.

129
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,479
Sir,

130
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,039
you already drunk too much.

131
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,919
Leave me alone.

132
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,880
Leave me alone, please.

133
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
More, please.

134
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,039
I want one as well.

135
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,719
Du Xiaosu,

136
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,799
you were right.

137
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,080
The person I've been resenting

138
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,440
is long gone.

139
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,840
Who am I?

140
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,960
Monster.

141
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,320
Lei Yuzheng, don't be like that.

142
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,799
Lei Yuzheng, I know you're sad.

143
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,440
I know you want to vent.

144
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,520
But you can't torture yourself
like that.

145
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,039
I don't need your sympathy.

146
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:10,799
Go.

147
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,119
Go away.

148
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,760
Go.

149
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,599
Lei Yuzheng, think about Mr. Lei.

150
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Think about the people
who care about you.

151
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,080
Cheer yourself up, please.

152
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,479
Don't mention him.

153
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,159
He's gone.

154
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,559
All is finished.

155
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,239
What about me?

156
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,640
Mr. Lei,

157
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,440
had his own pain.

158
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,880
He was doing that for you.

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,640
He had no other choice but to do so,

160
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,960
right?

161
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,080
Lei Yuzheng, where are you going?

162
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,599
What do you want to do?

163
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,119
Du Xiaosu,

164
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:06,400
for you or anyone else,

165
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,479
I don't want to have any relationship.

166
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,359
Lei Yuzheng.

167
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,479
Slowly.

168
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,640
Mind the step.

169
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,320
Lei Yuzheng, are you OK?

170
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,520
Slowly, please.

171
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,559
How is he? Wipe with a warm towel.

172
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,679
He seems to have a fever.

173
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,200
Does he?

174
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,359
Getting hot.

175
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,400
Have to take some medicine.

176
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,119
Uncle Duan, please get some medicine.
I will take care of him.

177
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,239
OK.

178
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,320
Mom.

179
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,039
Mom.

180
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,760
Mom.

181
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,080
Please don't go! Please!

182
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't worry. I will not leave.

183
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,799
Yuzheng.

184
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,200
Yuzheng.

185
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,479
Mom.

186
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,280
It's been many years,

187
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,439
and you still remember me?

188
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,000
You're my son.

189
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,479
Once I've seen your face,

190
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,319
and heard your voice,

191
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,400
Mom will never forget.

192
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,719
Mom, please don't go.

193
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Please stay with me.

194
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,319
Mom has never forgotten you.

195
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,199
But I hope you can forget me.

196
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,359
Yuzheng, remember that

197
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,479
to forget one person

198
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,640
is to love another person more.

199
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,239
Mom has left you.

200
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,719
But she is with you.

201
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,119
Cherish the people around you.

202
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,959
Don't be like realizing
the past happiness until separation.

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,079
Yuzheng,

204
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,599
don't hate your dad.

205
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
We are now with each other.

206
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,040
Very, very happy.

207
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,680
You don't need to worry about us.

208
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,680
Mom has to go now.

209
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:31,640
Mom.

210
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,079
Take good care of yourself.

211
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Mom.

212
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,880

Du Xiaosu,

228
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,079
when you are reading this letter,

229
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,280
I already left this city.

230
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,079
Thank you for taking care of my dad
during this period.

231
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,040
And really thank you

232
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,640
for being in my life.

233
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,479
Before I met you,

234
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,839
I've always lived alone.

235
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,000
At that time,
I didn't know what loneliness is

236
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,880
and what emptiness is.

237
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,040
Because I had no time
to think about it,

238
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,920
to think about why I'm not happy,

239
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,040
and what is missing in my life.

240
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,680
If I didn't meet you,

241
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,000
I would never believe

242
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,000
there is such a pure smile.

243
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,319
I would not believe there is a voice

244
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,719
that I want to listen to all the time.
(Letter from Lei Yuzheng)

245
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:05,839
I would not even believe that
a lady's tear

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,880
can make me so painful.

247
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,040
I began to fear of being alone,
(Yuzheng)

248
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,820
(Yuzheng)

249
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,760
fear of loneliness,
and fear of losing you.

250
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:16,928
(Yuzheng)

251
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,439
Gradually, I realized that,

252
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
with you around,

253
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,599
life can be so wonderful.

254
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,800
Du Xiaosu.

255
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,439
Thank you so much.

256
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,479
You came into my life just as sunshine.

257
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,400
But unfortunately,

258
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,599
it is always dark in my heart,

259
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,520
and it will never be lightened.

260
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,439
I don't want to be
the burden of your life.

261
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,280
So I left.

262
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,359
Don't come to look for me.

263
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,640
At last,

264
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,800
one more thing,

265
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,479
please operate the studio well.

266
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,839
In that case,

267
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,560
all the things I did for you
will be meaningful.

268
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,359
Farewell, Du Xiaosu.

269
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,359
Wish you happiness.

270
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
Xiaosu,

271
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,680
sorry. I'm sorry. I'm late.

272
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,119
Siqi,

273
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,680
I'm so tired.

274
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,680
But I tried my best to find him,

275
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,160
and I can't find him anywhere.

276
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,439
Lei Yuzheng really disappeared
this time.

277
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,880
He will never come back.

278
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,439
No way. I have to find him.

279
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Xiaosu,

280
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,920
listen to me.

281
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,800
Mr. Lei chose to leave.

282
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,119
He just wanted to be alone.

283
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,439
What we can do now is

284
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
to stay here until he comes back.

285
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,880
Think about it.

286
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,760
He has done so much for you.

287
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,479
He just wants you
to run the studio well,

288
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,040
hold on to your dream,
and be happy every day.

289
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,680
If you cannot hold it anymore,

290
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,719
do you think there's still hope for him?

291
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,719
Xiaosu,

292
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:47,119
we will always be with you

293
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,760
until he comes back.

294
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,520
Fell asleep?

295
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,760
Where on earth does Mr. Lei go?

296
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,959
It doesn't matter where he goes.

297
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,959
He left that letter and

298
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,959
just wanted to make Du Xiaosu give up.

299
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,680
He has underestimated Xiaosu
and her love to him.

300
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
It's not easy for Mr. Lei either.

301
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,359
He was in agony,

302
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,920
and he doesn't want us to see it.

303
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,000
If there is any difficulty,
they can work it out together.

304
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,160
If there is any problem,
they can face it together.

305
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,479
I don't understand why he just chose to

306
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,520
run away from his friends
and not to face his true feelings.

307
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,079
Siqi...

308
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,880
Fine. Save it.

309
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,079
It's too late. You have to go.

310
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,959
Xiaosu,

311
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,439
You up?

312
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,479
Are you OK?

313
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,319
I'm fine.

314
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm going to the studio now.

315
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll probably be back very late tonight.

316
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,239
You can start dinner without me.

317
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,920
Have some breakfast before you go.

318
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,319
It's OK. I'm not hungry.

319
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,400
Bye.

320
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:09,824
(Weekly Project Progress Chart)

321
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,560
No matter where you are,

322
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,839
as long as you are happy.

323
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,439
Xiaosu, there's something wrong.

324
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,760
What happened?

325
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,439
Some environment-friendly materials
are out of supply.

326
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,160
We can't find a substitute for now.

327
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,359
I'm afraid the construction schedule
is really going to be delayed.

328
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:56,920
You...

329
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,839
Got it.

330
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,199
Mr. Yang,

331
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,280
this is Du Xiaosu.

332
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,640
Mr. Song.

333
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,439
Hello, Mr. Wood.

334
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,719
Yeah, we haven't met for a long time.

335
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,719
OK. Well...

336
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,959
I...  I'll call you later.

337
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
You are busy?

338
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,359
OK.

339
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,839
Thank you. Bye.

340
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:53,959

341
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,760
Siqi.

342
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,479
Have a look.

343
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,079
Just have a look, please.

344
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,920
I have to say something?

345
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,599
You can't hold it anymore
if I keep being quiet.

346
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,839
This diamond ring is too bright.

347
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,479
An old leftover girl like me has waited
for my true love for a long time.

348
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,479
Am I still not allowed to show off
for a few days?

349
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,400
Blind date may look old-fashioned,

350
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,280
but it works.

351
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,439
Look.

352
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,520
This is a photo of me and my husband.

353
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,560
We met on a blind date.

354
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,479
This was in Bali.

355
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,119
A photo from our honeymoon.

356
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,640
He works in the finance industry.

357
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,359
Our apartment is on Financial Street.

358
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,199
It will be ready next month.

359
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,160
You're welcome to come.

360
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,359
It's nice.

361
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,119
How happy you are!

362
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,239
How did you find your true love?

363
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,280
To be honest,

364
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,439
you are getting older and older.

365
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,119
You should find someone
to take care of you.

366
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,920
I have to tell you

367
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,119
my husband
works with several single men.

368
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,239
Do you need me to introduce them to you?

369
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm good. Don't worry about me.

370
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,400
No, thanks.

371
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,479
Fine. I have to go.

372
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,520
Just go.

373
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,359
Enjoy your coffee.

374
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,040
Bye.

375
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,199
Bye.

376
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,839
Shangguan...

377
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,800
All right. Deal.

378
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,079
I'll transfer the money to you now.

379
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,800
Thanks.

380
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,560
Done.

381
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,359
Xiaosu, I admire you so much.

382
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,520
You've got the materials

383
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,800
that are so hard to buy.

384
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,160
Awesome!

385
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,680
You did a good job as well.

386
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,239
Go and have a rest.

387
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,280
You are here.

388
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,199
Come here.

389
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,160
I finally see you again.

390
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,239
Still angry?

391
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,119
A small gift.

392
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,319
Don't be angry anymore.

393
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,760
You figured it out?

394
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,959
Yes, I did.

395
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,760
I can't live without you.

396
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
You really figured it out?

397
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
For sure.

398
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,599
I want to be with you.

399
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,640
For you,

400
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,680
I can stop dating other women
for a while.

401
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,920
For a while?

402
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,199
What do you mean?

403
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,479
This gift

404
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,359
is just a gift.

405
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,839
Me?

406
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,400
I won't be thinking
about marrying anyone.

407
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,479
Shangguan,

408
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,479
we may not belong to the same world.

409
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,400
I've asked you many times

410
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,520
about whether you figured it out.

411
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,199
Actually, I'm the one
who should figure it out first.

412
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,439
Thank you for favoring me.

413
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,640
And thank you for giving me a chance
to dream about having a good life.

414
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,160
From now on,

415
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,319
don't come to me again, please.

416
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Bye.

417
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,400
Siqi, are you serious?

418
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,520
Siqi...

419
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,719
Engineer Zhang,

420
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,079
the design of this part

421
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,800
is different from that on the drawing.

422
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,839
It was Mr. Liu who made the changes.

423
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,160
I couldn't do anything about it.

424
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,680
Mr. Liu?

425
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,599
However, if we do so,

426
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,280
not only will there be security risks,

427
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,920
but also the overall design
will be affected.

428
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:23,959
I have to call Mr. Liu.

429
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,760
Mr. Liu, this is Xiaosu.

430
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,119
I'm at the construction site now.

431
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:33,119
Our project

432
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,839
is not quite the same as
what we designed before.

433
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,680
So I...

434
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,079
You are still young and inexperienced,

435
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,959
so your design still has defect.

436
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,880
I have personally
helped you make the changes,

437
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,119
and you still have concerns?

438
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,640
No, Mr. Liu. I...

439
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,800
No need to say anything more.

440
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,040
Last time, because of the raw materials,

441
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,280
you've already delayed the project.

442
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,719
Let's do this the same way we did it.

443
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,119
Catch up on your work.

444
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,160
Mr. Liu...

445
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,400
One more, please.

446
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,119
You are alone today. Where is Shangguan?

447
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Don't mention him. We broke up.

448
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,800
What are you laughing at?

449
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,920
You don't sell wine to singles?

450
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,760
What are you doing here, Siqi?

451
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,000
I just thought of you and you showed up.

452
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,160
Where is Shangguan?

453
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,040
You are so drunk.

454
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,119
It's not safe for a girl to stay here.

455
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,760
Who is Shangguan? I don't know him.

456
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,680
I only know you.

457
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,280
OK. Stop drinking. Let me take you home.

458
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,000
He Qunfei,

459
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,079
do you think I'm pretty?

460
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,160
What?

461
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:49,079
Do you think I'm pretty?

462
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,439
You are the prettiest

463
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,920
and loveliest girl I have ever seen.

464
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,040
So do you want to be my boyfriend again?

465
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,560
Mr. Lei senior just passed away.

466
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,239
Mr. Lei junior is missing.

467
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm really not in the mood right now,
Siqi.

468
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,080
Besides, you already have Shangguan.

469
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,760
Shangguan is a jerk.

470
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,320
I, Zou Siqi, am more of a jerk.

471
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,120
You were so good to me.

472
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,800
Why didn't I cherish it?

473
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,199
How could I...

474
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,760
For that temptation, I just let you...

475
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,439
Qunfei,

476
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,280
in this world,

477
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
there is no way to turn it back?

478
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
No matter how much money I provide now,

479
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,360
it's still too late?

480
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:51,959
Don't say anything more.

481
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,959
Go. Let's go home.

482
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
Go.

483
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,719
I did drink a little too much today.

484
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
But I know, in my heart,

485
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,159
I love you, He Qunfei.

486
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:27,439
I just don't know
if there's still a chance,

487
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
I can keep loving you.

488
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,280
When you don't expect it,

489
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,439
destiny always surprises you.

490
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,879
Let you know that
your previous ambition

491
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,159
was just a joke.

492
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,560
After all of this,

493
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,080
I realized that

494
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
realizing the value of my life

495
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,080
is what I really want.

496
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,719
Maybe temporary absence

497
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,439
will be a new start.

498
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,600
Xiaosu,

499
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
two groups of clients
will visit this afternoon.

500
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,639
One at three clock
and the other at five clock.

501
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,159
Is that OK?

502
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,959
Xiaosu.

503
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,120
Xiaosu.

504
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,040
Sorry, what did you say?

505
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:27,520
I said there will be
clients to visit us this afternoon.

506
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:29,479
Xiaosu,

507
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:32,040
you have been so absent-minded recently.

508
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,040
Anything happened at home?

509
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
No, nothing.

510
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,159
Oh, I'm going out in a minute.

511
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,479
Would you please look after
the business for a while for me?

512
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,879
Well, what about the clients' visit?

513
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,760
Cancel it if you can.

514
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:55,296
(Lei Yuzheng)

515
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,520
...put it behind a child,

516
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,239
and don't let him know.

517
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,959
Be quick and catch him.

518
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,760
Be quick

519
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,959
and catch him.

520
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,919
Throw the handkerchief.
(Dream Primary School)

521
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,959
Quietly put it behind a child,

522
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,879
and don't let him know.

523
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:39,959
Miss Du.

524
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,239
Uncle Duan.

525
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,239
You bought these things again.

526
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:48,879
Has Lei Yuzheng called these days?

527
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,639
No.

528
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,439
Any mails?

529
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,040
Have you checked the mailbox?

530
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,959
Just in case, the place he lives now,

531
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,560
has no signal.

532
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,159
Miss Du, I have checked the mailbox.

533
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,159
Nothing.

534
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Let me get the door.

535
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,479
Please take the things in.

536
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,000
Fine.

537
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,080
Hello, may I help you?

538
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,560
Lei Yuzheng lives here, right?

539
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
Yes.

540
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
Who are you?

541
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,800
Mr. Lei passed away.

542
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,159
Just passed away.

543
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,679
Lei Yuzheng is missing, right?

544
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,120
How did you know that?

545
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,439
If I were him,
I would have done the same.

546
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,520
Please have a seat.

547
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,479
May I have your name, please?

548
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,479
I'm Liu Siyang.

549
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,120
Lei Yuzheng called me Siyang.

550
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,439
You can call me the same as he does.

551
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,199
Please take a seat.

552
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,479
I'll make you a pot of tea.

553
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,360
OK.

554
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes, it's hard for you right now.

555
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,399
But in this world,
which family or person

556
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,879
has no difficulty at all?

557
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Yuzheng,

558
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,399
it's really you.

559
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,239
I was just thinking

560
