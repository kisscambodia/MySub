Yuzheng.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,600
Why didn't you tell me in advance
that you will come?

18
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,960
We have received

19
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,720
the money, footballs, projectors,
and generators

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,199
that you sent to school.

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,240
We don't have to worry about
blackouts in school anymore.

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,520
These little kids miss you a lot.

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,320
They often asked me in my ears,

24
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,360
when is Uncle Lei coming,

25
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,360
when is Auntie Xiaosu coming?

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,520
They just kept asking again and again.

27
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,240
Why didn't I see Shanwa?

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,399
Where is he?

29
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:34,399
HIs mother took him to the city.

30
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,399
His father is almost recovered.

31
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,320
His family is now together.

32
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,559
Shanwa is so happy about that.

33
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,759
Oh,

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
look. This is their family photo.

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,679
If I had known you were coming,

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,399
I would've asked Shanwa to come to you.

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,800
Why didn't I see Xiaosu?

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,119
Didn't she come with you?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Tell you what,

40
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,360
when Lei Yuzheng was put in prison,

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,279
I thought
he was a coddled and pampered child.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,199
I even made a bet with others.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,839
We bet he won't make it.

44
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,240
But,

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,479
he's really got something to be admired.

46
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
You know what?

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,199
When we got in there,

48
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,600
there were always some people
who wanted to pick a fight with us.

49
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,360
Because of his family's reputation,

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,839
he had to suffer more.

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,720
He got beaten.

52
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,320
For one time. Just one.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
After that,

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,800
nobody dared to provoke him.

55
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,360
I've respected few people in my life.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,679
He is one of them.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,399
To tell you the truth,

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,240
he would never let me see him.

59
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,199
I have no idea about these.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,279
But I knew it every time you came.

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,320
Lei Yuzheng has been through a lot.

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
He is tough underneath.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
But people like him

64
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,320
needs a hand in the desperate situation.

65
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,039
Don't you think so?

66
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,279
I have to leave now.

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,559
We can meet after he's back.

68
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,839
Thank you for telling me this today.

69
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,959
You're welcome.

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,519
God helps those who help themselves.

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,359
The setback is in his mind.

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
He has to live over it by himself.

73
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,799
I'm leaving.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,920
Yuzheng,

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,279
how many days are you going to stay
this time?

76
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,079
Why?

77
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,160
I just came here and
you already wanna drive me away?

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,239
No.

79
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,600
I wish you lived here all the time.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,839
Fine.

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
Then, I'll live here.

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,359
Really? Are you kidding me?

83
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,679
You're so busy.

84
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,640
How can you live here all the time?

85
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,519
I'm not busy.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm serious.

87
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,600
I have made up my mind.

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,359
Fine.

89
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
On the island,

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,880
you can look at
the mountains and the sea,

91
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,040
and you may feel better then.

92
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,760
Kids,

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,720
do you miss Uncle Lei?

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
Yes!

95
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,399
Is Uncle Lei nice?

96
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,959
Yes!

97
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,200
Then, ask him to play games with you,
Ok?

98
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,720
Ok!

99
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,880
I'm coming!

100
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,480
Run! Run!

101
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,880
Run! Run! Run!

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,959
Did you ask me about
the dismissal of Mr. Xia?

103
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,040
Dad,

104
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,640
uncle Xia resigned himself.

105
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,279
Why I'm the one to blame?

106
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,239
Besides,

107
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,600
what's the big deal?

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,799
Why do you get angry like this?

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,359
You fired him today.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,959
Who will be the next?

111
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,559
Let me ask you.

112
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,119
How many long-time employees
in the group have been left?

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,720
What do you want?

114
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Dad.

115
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,760
I have difficulties in this position.

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,640
I can't ask for your permission

117
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,880
for every decision I make.

118
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,200
I took the liberty of firing uncle Xia.

119
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,359
I apologize for that.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
But no matter what I've done
went extreme or not,

121
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,519
the performance of the company
during this period of time was improved.

122
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,679
You can see it.

123
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
Xiangyuan,

124
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,519
I can let go of this.

125
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,760
But remember,

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,679
you have to ask for my advice

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,799
before you can take any actions
in the future.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,959
Sure.

129
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,480
I keep it in my mind.

130
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,480
Nothing else, right?

131
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,519
Then, I'm leaving.

132
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,119
Mr. Liu,

133
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
why do you come to me?

134
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,679
To be honest,

135
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,920
when Mr. Ning introduced you to me
at the beginning,

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,160
I had doubt about your capability.

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,079
But today, I have to say that

138
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
it's worth it to have you

139
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,119
for this project.

140
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm flattered.

141
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,679
Our friendship grows from conflicts.

142
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,320
Look.
I used to be a little harsh on you.

143
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,559
Please don't mind.

144
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,600
No, I don't.

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
You started this project over

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,160
for two times in the middle.

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,279
And you paid the bill yourself.

148
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,480
This

149
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,040
is the allowance to you.

150
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,239
That's all right, Mr. Liu.

151
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,959
That's what I should do.

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's just keep the contract.

153
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,640
I can't accept it.

154
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,000
Fine.

155
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,239
Since you insist so much,

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,880
you have my recognition.

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,880
I have a big contract
worth of two million yuan

158
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,600
on the way.

159
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,799
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry,

160
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,200
but I wanna take a break,

161
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,160
and I don't take any order
for the time being.

162
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,079
Why? You quit?

163
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
It's not like that.

164
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,559
Just for now.

165
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,760
Why?

166
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,119
Your business is just picking up.

167
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,480
You are so young.

168
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,720
Why do you have to close down
when there's money to make?

169
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,640
Money is important to me.

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,760
But it's not the most important.

171
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,839
I have a friend who needs me now.

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,279
I have to be with him.

173
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,920
Miss Du,

174
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,119
can I ask you a private question?

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,920
Is this for love?

176
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
I got it.

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Miss Du has affections and loyalty.

178
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,399
I admire you very much.

179
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,160
How about this?

180
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,320
Whenever you wanna work together,

181
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,559
come to.

182
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,959
Ok. Thank you.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Hello.

184
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,520
Yes.

185
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,039
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,080
The studio is closed for now.

187
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,599
I'm not available now.

188
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,000
Thank you. Bye.

189
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,080
What are you talking about?

190
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,359
The studio has been closed?

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,960
Du Xiaosu,

192
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,320
what are you doing?

193
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm going to find Lei Yuzheng.

194
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,000
Lei Yuzheng?

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
I know Lei Yuzheng

196
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,520
is very important to you.

197
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,159
You can give up everything for him.

198
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,400
But,

199
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,880
he's not like us, Xiaosu.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,960
He's out of the prison.

201
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,039
He still has a big fortune to spend.

202
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
But you...If you close down the studio,

203
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,840
you'll be down and out.

204
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,159
Have you ever thought about it?

205
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,119
I'm talking to you!

206
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,280
Have you figured all of this out?

207
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
Siqi,

208
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
if it's not for Lei Yuzheng,

209
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,679
I won't have my studio.

210
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,599
If I can't find him,

211
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,239
I'm not in mood for design now.

212
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,960
Don't worry.

213
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,159
Yuzheng,

214
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,719
I just went to town

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,119
and got some dishes that go with liquor.

216
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,520
Fine. Come on in.
(Borrowing Regulation)

217
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,080
Here.

218
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,359
Cheers.

219
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,239
Yuzheng,

220
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,840
you and Xiaosu are good people.

221
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,760
I really have no idea

222
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
what to do to thank you.

223
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,479
All right. Never mind.

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,799
For the kids,

225
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,320
you stay on this island on your own.

226
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
There are not many

227
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,000
young people like you now.

228
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,239
Yes.

229
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,520
Even my girlfriend

230
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
doesn't understand me.

231
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,359
She always said that
life here is too difficult.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,080
She insisted that I should go
to work with her in the city.

233
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,799
What about the kids

234
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,760
if I leave?

235
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,359
Are you

236
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,400
on break now?

237
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,320
Probably,

238
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,599
she's been married now.

239
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,200
Let bygones be bygones.

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,520
Come on. Here's to you.

241
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,239
Yuzheng,

242
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,440
we are men.

243
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,080
I can see that

244
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
you and Xiaosu

245
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,119
had a fight, didn't you?

246
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
If you really can forget about her,

247
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,760
why do you have to live in this house?

248
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,960
Am I right?

249
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,400
But Yuzheng,

250
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,440
Xiaosu is really a good girl.

251
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,039
There are not many girls

252
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,599
as persistent as she is.

253
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,599
Don't wait

254
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
until to lose to know
how to cherish like me.

255
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:11,008
(Photo-Dating. Private Proposal)

256
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,599
CEO of the public company.

257
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,599
Well...

258
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,039
How come I, Zou Siqi,

259
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,280
cannot find a man to have dinner
with me.

260
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,159
You look so different from the photo.

261
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,799
You beautified it, right?

262
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,599
Dark yellow skin, rough pores.

263
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,320
You should take care of your skin.

264
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm telling you,

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,359
if we women pay little attention to

266
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
the external beauty,

267
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,520
men

268
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,479
won't give us

269
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,159
the chance to show our internal beauty.

270
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,640
You only have two minutes.

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,679
I...

272
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,799
Stop talking.

273
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,039
Listen to me.

274
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,559
I'll give you 300 thousand yuan

275
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,159
as your plastic surgery fund.

276
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,559
Enhance your breasts.

277
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,799
Firm your butt.

278
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,880
Plump your lips.

279
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
And lose your fat.

280
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,640
After you do all of that,

281
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,559
you can barely be my mistress.

282
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,359
Stop talking! Stop stalking!

283
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,159
How about this?

284
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,799
I give you 50 thousand yuan every month.

285
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,719
And by the end of the year,

286
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,080
you can get a dividend.

287
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,559
Such requests

288
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
are acceptable.

289
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,840
Totally acceptable!

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,880
You're making me lose my confidence.

291
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,559
Mr. Gold Necklace, look over there.

292
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,559
There is a beauty.

293
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,640
Where? Where? Where?

294
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,599
Take one back home.

295
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,320
Perfect match for you.

296
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,799
As a woman,

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,840
aside from
being capable of giving birth,

298
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,599
the most important is that

299
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,919
she has to make contributions
to the family.

300
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,880
At least,

301
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,039
her salary should be half of mine.

302
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,799
Look. I've been

303
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
on blind dates for many times.

304
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,039
Why do I come across

305
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
the women like moth?

306
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,760
They can't even meet such requests!

307
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,599
All of them don't deserve me.

308
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,799
May I ask

309
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,599
how much is your monthly salary?

310
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,719
4,000 yuan.

311
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,520
Then I don't think
they are good for you.

312
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,880
Another drink, please.

313
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,960
On the way.

314
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,320
Not alone.

315
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm leaving after this.

316
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,760
Not alone. Not lonely.

317
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,400
Don't wanna talk to you.

318
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,719
Last time we met,
you were dressing like this.

319
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,400
Don't you know to get dressed
to pick up girls?

320
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,799
I came here to drink.

321
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,280
Nobody cares what I'm dressed with.

322
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,960
Is it real?

323
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,320
It sounds like

324
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,159
there must be a lot of chicks
buying you drinks.

325
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,640
Aren't you the same?

326
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,520
Of course.

327
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,359
Do you think you and Shangguan are

328
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,400
the only luck of me?

329
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:31,960
Look.

330
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
What do you think?

331
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
My new boyfriend.

332
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,599
What do you think?

333
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,640
Enjoy yourself.

334
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm leaving.

335
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,520
Have a seat. Shall we talk?

336
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
How are you doing recently?

337
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
What?

338
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,080
How are you doing recently?

339
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,880
Nothing new.

340
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,239
You saw everything?

341
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,479
We've broken up for so long.

342
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,119
Are you still waiting for me?

343
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,640
If you don't want a relationship,

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,280
you can just have an affair.

345
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,280
You know I'm not that kind of person.

346
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,320
He Qunfei.

347
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,039
I think you're the man.

348
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,719
Lei Yuzheng has a friend like you.

349
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,119
I'll give him a thumb up.

350
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,119
But I'd like to ask you a question.

351
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,880
Is it worth it?

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
When Lian Po made amends,

353
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,880
he just bore the rods

354
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,080
and walked through the alley.

355
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,599
How long are you going to bear the rods?

356
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,800
Are you going to be single for him
for your life?

357
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,199
I'm out of my own will.

358
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,920
I've been living a good life.

359
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,800
No one would come here
if everything goes well.

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,400
What does it taste like?

361
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,359
This is bitter,

362
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,239
not even as good as medicine.

363
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,560
Siqi. I know

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,319
I failed you.

365
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,880
Since you've let it go,

366
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,000
stop saying sorry.

367
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,760
I know

368
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,439
you're just taking it out on me.

369
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,280
I am taking it out on you.

370
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,040
The guy in the bar

371
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,000
is not your boyfriend.

372
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,400
I just don't understand.

373
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,800
How come a good girl like me

374
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,719
has no admirers.

375
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,959
I've also tried blind dates.

376
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,280
But in the end, I realized

377
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,880
I want nothing to do with them at all.

378
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,959
I can't allow anyone else in my heart.

379
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,400
Siqi. I...

380
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,400
Qunfei.

381
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,079
Can we

382
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,199
see each other again?

383
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,079
Sure.

384
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,680
As long as you want,

385
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,319
you can meet me anytime.

386
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,119
It's just...

387
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,439
Stop.

388
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,880
I got it.

389
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,880
Just fit your deeds to your words.

390
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,239
You have my word.

391
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,479
You can treat me to dinner later.

392
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,439
I'm leaving.

393
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,000
Think about it.

394
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
We've been working together

395
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,079
for more than a decade.

396
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,479
Over the past years,

397
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,760
I've made a lot for everyone.

398
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,319
Yes. Yes.

399
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,239
That alone makes

400
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,520
you have to accompany me some tea

401
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,479
when you take a break.

402
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,680
Tea is fine.

403
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,680
It's just

404
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,719
we don't feel sure.

405
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,359
We have no idea what you're up to.

406
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,719
Since you've asked,

407
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,079
I'll just make it clear.

408
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
In my whole life,

409
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,400
I've hired men I trust,

410
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,079
and trusted the men I hired.

411
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,479
What Lin Xiangyuan has done

412
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,760
sometimes makes me have to change.

413
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,920
I'm planning to

414
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,959
put him on hold for a while.

415
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,800
As far what to do with him,

416
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,479
we'll talk about it later.

417
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,520
About removing Lin Xiangyuan
from the office,

418
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,160
if anyone doesn't wanna
get involved in it,

419
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,640
just let me know.

420
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,079
Hello everyone.

421
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,079
Hello.

422
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:57,504
(Emergency Exit)

423
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:02,720
(China opens to the world)

424
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,719
You really live here?

425
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,640
I just heard from Teacher Sun that

426
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,160
the houses on the island were shaken

427
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,800
by the typhoon,

428
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,400
and it was you who fixed them all.

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,520
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

430
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,920
I wouldn't believe it.

431
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,640
I just come to see you,

432
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
and get you something to eat and use.

433
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,208
(School Magazine)

434
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,479
Did you watch the video of Shanwa?

435
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,560
How funny he is now.

436
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,040
He has learned the seaweed dance.

437
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,079
Seaweed. Seaweed.

438
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,319
And he's got fat and tall.

439
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,359
It must be his mother.

440
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,599
Lei Yuzheng.

441
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
Lei Yuzheng, where are you going?

442
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,280
Du Xiaosu,

443
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,439
what are you doing here?

444
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,239
Me?

445
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,880
I came to see you.

446
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,920
Don't you have your own business to do?

447
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,040
You're just like the dogskin plaster
every day.

448
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,880
Of course I do.

449
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,880
From now on I only have one thing to do.

450
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,599
Keep an eye on you.

451
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
For what?

452
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,160
No matter where I am or what I'll do,

453
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,479
it has nothing to do with you.

454
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,760
Lei Yuzheng.

455
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,680
You suddenly disappeared.

456
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,920
You have no idea how much
everyone has been worrying about you.

457
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm really afraid that
something might happen to you.

458
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,160
Don't you understand

459
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
what I'm talking about?

460
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
I wanna be alone.

461
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:50,800
Please stay away from me.

462
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,359
Lei Yuzheng. Stop

463
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,800
pushing away the people
who care about you.

464
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,920
Will you?

465
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,000
We wanna help you.

466
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,319
Du Xiaosu.

467
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,119
In this world,

468
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,920
probably there are many people
who needs your help.

469
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm not one of them.

470
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,359
Lei Yuzheng. Stop!

471
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Lei Yuzheng!

472
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,520
Lei Yuzheng!

473
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,280
Don't let it get to you.

474
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:37,239
I'm begging you. Don't jump.

475
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,599
Du Xiaosu, what are you talking about?

476
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,640
You scared the hell out of me!

477
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
You were coming up all of a sudden.

478
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,000
Why do I jump?

479
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,040
Then why are you standing so high?

480
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,439
Don't you wanna jump to end it all?

481
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
If you wanna jump,

482
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,359
I'll jump with you.

483
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,359
You jump. I jump.

484
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,119
Du Xiaosu.

485
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,800
Is there anyone in this world
who is more annoying than you?

486
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,239
When I was in Shanghai,

487
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,760
you had been following me to my home.

488
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,400
I come to this island,

489
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,199
and you follow me all the way here.

490
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,000
If I really can't figure it out,

491
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,520
it is because of you.

492
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,359
Come on. Let go of me.

493
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,880
No!

494
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,359
You wanna keep holding me like this?

495
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,359
What if you get too excited,

496
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,040
and our feet just slide?

497
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
We might fall.

498
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,839
Don't scare me.

499
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,479
Unless you say
you are not going to jump into the sea.

500
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
You swear.

501
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,479
I swear. I won't jump.

502
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,560
Can you let go of me?

503
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,800
You

504
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,640
didn't

505
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,640
mean to jump into the sea, did you?

506
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm not like you.

507
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,199
Go ahead. What do you want from me?

508
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,680
Liu Siyang came to me.

509
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,000
He told me a lot about you
when you were in prison.

510
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,199
Lei Yuzheng.

511
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,520
No matter how you drive me away
in the future,

512
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
I won't leave you.

513
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,560
If you wanna stay on the island
as a fisherman,

514
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,760
I'll be a fisherman with you.

515
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,839
If you

516
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,160
don't wanna leave this island
all your life,

517
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,719
then I'll also stay here for my life.

518
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,520
Yuzheng, Xiaosu,

519
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,880
tonight let's...

520
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,839
Anyone?

521
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,479
There...

522
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,359
There is no way out.

523
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,000
We're done.

524
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,560
The tide is in.

525
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,439
How can we go back?

526
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,000
No signal.

527
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,479
Where is your phone?

528
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,800
My phone?

529
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,079
I...

530
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,520
I just came out in a hurry.

531
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
I didn't take it.

532
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,479
Yuzheng, Xiaosu.

533
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,079
Mr. Li. Hurry up!

534
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,760
Yuzheng.

535
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,400
Yuzheng.

536
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:47,959
Xiaosu.

537
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,400
Xiaosu, are you ok?

538
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,839
Why is your head burning so much?

539
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,479
I'm fine.

540
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Xiaosu.

541
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,719
Don't…Hang in there!

542
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,119
Don't fall asleep.

543
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,000
During this period of time,

544
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,880
I always came here alone,

545
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,839
watching the boundless sea

546
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,239
and the lonely rocks.

547
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,719
They have no one to depend on,

548
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
particularly like
what I've been through.

549
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,079
I was sitting here

550
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,719
and wondering that

551
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,959
probably a lot of things

552
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,680
are meant to be.

553
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
In that kind of family,

554
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,479
I got fortune and status.

555
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,880
So, the God surely won't make me happy.

556
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,959
I was doomed to lose my mother.

557
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,920
It is doomed that nobody would love me.

558
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,400
And I can't learn how to love.

559
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,839
Everything now...

560
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:16,672
(The tomb of Wan Hua)

561
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:20,160
Everything has turned out to be
meaningless.

562
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,880
Lei Yuzheng, don't think like that.

563
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,560
Not that I don't want to

564
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,000
end it all,

565
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,040
and then I would be much more relieved.

566
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,199
But I figured it out very soon.

567
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,319
For people living in this world,

568
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:46,719
the most painful thing is not
getting old and dying alone.

569
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,160
Instead, it is that,
no matter how much you've paid,

570
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,040
you can't change the reality.

571
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,719
My mother already left me.

572
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,359
Since I was a child,

573
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,920
I have been determined
to become an excellent person

574
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,400
in order to prove to her.

575
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,719
It was such a mistake that

576
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,239
she abandoned me twenty years ago.

577
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,160
But later I realized

578
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,119
my mother had been dead.

579
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
Over the past twenty years,

580
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,079
no matter I have loved her or hated her,

581
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,760
I can't change it.

582
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
My mother can never come back.

583
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,319
Lei Yuzheng,

584
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,319
I'm cold.

585
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,479
I'm so cold.

586
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,479
Xiaosu.

587
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm so cold.

588
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,359
Xiaosu.

589
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,239
You hang in there!

590
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,959
Xiaosu.

591
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,880
Lei Yuzheng.

592
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,040
Can you promise me one thing?

593
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,839
If we...

594
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,800
Xiaosu. Don't worry.

595
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,719
We can't make it.

596
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,079
I'll take you back.

597
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,719
Never leave me alone.

598
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
You hang in there!

599
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,760
Promise me.

600
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,199
I promise you.

601
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
Yuzheng.

602
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,839
Yuzheng. Xiaosu.

603
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,160
Are you there?

604
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,800
Yuzheng.

605
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,239
Over there.

606
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,199
Teacher Sun.

607
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,239
Xiaosu. Someone is coming for us!

608
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,560
Xiaosu!

609
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,319
Wake up! Xiaosu! Xiaosu!

610
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,040
Teacher Sun. We're here!

611
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,239
Teacher Sun.

612
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:29,599
Did I rave in my fever?

613
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,520
I take it seriously.

614
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
Why do you flush so much?

615
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,400
Your fever is already gone, isn't it?

616
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,280
The fever is already gone.

617
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,920
Why are you being so nice to me?

618
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,239
Of course I have to be nice to you.

619
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,800
The better you treat me,

620
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,319
I feel less secured in my heart

621
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,119
and more scared.

622
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,599
I'm afraid you have to be scared
for a while.

623
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,479
I will always be nice to you.

624
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Dad, it's weekend today.

625
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,479
Lin Xiangyuan said
he would come to see you.

626
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,199
Dad.

627
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,400
Dad.

628
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,319
The tea is cold.
I'll make you some hot tea.

629
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:33,619
(Yutian Briefing)

630
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,439
My tea has been cold for a long time.

631
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
Tell me. Why do you come to me today,

632
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,479
Mr. Lin?

633
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,839
Dad. Please forgive me.

634
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:54,839
I'm an ass.

635
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,119
I was not mature.

636
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,079
You've been so nice to me.

637
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,959
I failed you.

638
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,439
I...

639
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,040
Keep cool.

640
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,199
I know.

641
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
I was a poor boy.
If it's not you,

642
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,719
I cannot be who I am today.

643
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,239
I would be nobody.

644
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,359
I was too arrogant and swaggering.

645
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,079
And I made you angry.

646
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,680
I shouldn't have fired your old crew.

647
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,599
I shouldn't have embarrassed you.

648
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,400
Dad.

649
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,199
The person I feel most sorry to

650
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,239
is Fanlv.

651
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I was not a good husband

652
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,239
or a good son-in-law.

653
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
That'll do.

654
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,359
I swear that,

655
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,719
from today on,

656
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,000
I will

657
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,239
do the real work in Yutian

658
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,760
and take good care of Fanlv
back at home.

659
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,959
I won't make you worry about us.

660
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,159
Here we are.

661
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,360
Thank you.

662
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,600
Xiaosu.

663
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Wait.

664
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,879
I know what you want to say.

665
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,159
I'll pretend that nothing

666
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,919
has happened on the island.

667
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,560
No.

668
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,560
I just wanna say thank you.

669
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,719
For what?

670
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,199
For getting you a cold?

671
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,439
I've been really happy these days.

672
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,520
Thank you.

673
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,120
Well.

674
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,879
Excuse me.

675
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
Bro.

676
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,600
Bro.

677
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,320
You're really my God.

678
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,080
Get up! Get up!

679
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,080
Bro.

680
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,520
Thank you.

681
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,600
It's him

682
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,320
who cured my heart attack.

683
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,800
He...

684
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,760
He‘s not a doctor.
(We together to keep our health)

685
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,520
Such a great doctor

686
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,479
will come to a hospital like this?

687
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,639
Tell you what?

688
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Over these years,

689
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,080
I had heart attack every night.

690
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,360
I had been to many hospitals
but it didn't work out.

691
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,399
Last week,

692
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I was hospitalized here.

693
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,040
Just next to Mr. Liu.

694
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,919
Guess what?

695
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,000
One word by Mr. Liu

696
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,760
just cured me.

697
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,919
What did he say?

698
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:22,879
He told me

699
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,679
not to buy the shares of Baogang

700
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,639
but the shares of Tianhua New Energy.

701
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,000
You're fooling us.

702
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:29,239
This stock

703
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,800
raised limit in less than one week.

704
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:32,719
Over the past few years,

705
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:34,719
the stock of poor performance
has doubled the price.

706
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,000
Is it true?

707
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,959
Yes, it's true.

708
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What are you doing?

709
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,199
Having a meeting?

710
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,919
It's hospital.

711
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,879
Go back and take a rest.

712
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:42,560
Go back.

713
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,520
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

714
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,239
I'll see you another day.

715
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,919
See you. See you.

716
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,159
Fine. Take a good rest.

717
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,360
Good for you.

718
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,080
You're unbelievable! Dude！

719
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,439
You're a real-world Shawshank.

720
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,840
You don't take care of yourself
in the hospital,

721
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,719
but help others make money from stock?

722
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,800
I was just playing around.

723
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,360
Nothing to do anyway.

724
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,679
So boring.

725
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,959
In the detention house,

726
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,320
this is not allowed.

727
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,000
I finally come out

728
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,320
but has to be supervised by the nurses.

729
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,879
You have the heart attack

730
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,280
because of smoking this.

731
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,520
You're not afraid of death?

732
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,600
Will you just let me die?

733
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,479
No.

734
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,479
How about this?

735
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,959
You. Just smell.

736
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Take it after you get well.

737
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,320
I quit. Don't worry.

738
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,840
Do you wanna go back to Yutian or not?

739
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,399
The opportunity that belongs to you

740
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,600
is just like this last cigar.

741
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:54,560
No.

742
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,439
Come on.

743
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,080
Come with me.

744
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,040
Is it too soon to make the move?

745
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,800
What are you talking about?

746
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,199
Get changed quickly!

747
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,199
Come home with me.

748
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,800
You wanna stay in the hospital

749
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,600
suffering from these young nurses

750
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,000
or you wanna come home with me?

751
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,919
Smoke your Cuba cigar.

752
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,679
Cut the crap.

753
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,879
Wait for me. I pack my bag.

754
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,840
Run!

755
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,000
-Thank you.
-Bye.

756
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,840
Good for you.
You know this place very well.

757
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,280
I've been here.

758
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,919
Don't you ask who received me?

759
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,239
I know.

760
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,439
You said you didn't care about anything.

761
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,639
I know you can't let go of her.

762
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,080
Otherwise, why did you come back

763
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,560
immediately after she went for you.

764
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,879
I told you before that

765
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Du Xiaosu was more determined than you.

766
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:12,000
You will fall for her.

767
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,040
See?

768
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,679
You're right.

769
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,680
(Lei Yuzheng: What are you doing?
Du Xiaosu: What's the matter?)

770
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,479
Lei Yuzheng,

771
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,399
I'm talking to you!

772
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,719
With your beauty and your career,

773
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,320
you've been pretty busy all day.

774
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,040
Don't keep me at loose.

775
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,080
I'm not here on vacation.

776
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,520
I know what you wanna say.

777
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:39,328
(Let's have dinner together tonight!)

778
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,040
You just have a good rest.

779
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,239
When you get well,

780
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,520
let's take the long shot.

781
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:53,339
(Lei Yuzheng:
Let's have dinner together tonight)

782
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,120
I've been really happy these days.

783
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,199
Thank you.

784
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,399
For what?

785
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,959
For getting you a cold?

786
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,959
Look at your face, fair and tender.

787
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,040
What kind of a good place
is this island?

788
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:19,239
You make me wanna go there.

789
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,560
Nothing special.

790
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,600
The view was very good.

791
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,399
The view or the person?

792
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:33,760
