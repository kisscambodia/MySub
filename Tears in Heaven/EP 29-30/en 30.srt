16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,639
Du Xiaosu. Your delivery.

17
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,839
Ok. Thank you.

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,119
What a beautiful dress!

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
It's so nice.

20
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,000
It must cost a lot.

21
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,479
Is it from Lei Yuzheng？

22
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,639
Hurry up! Try it on and show me.

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,559
Hurry up! Hurry up!

24
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,320
Come on.

25
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,119
Hurry up! Hurry up! Go.

26
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,199
It is true that
the tailor makes the man.

27
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,160
Don't you think I am too conspicuous?

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,279
No. Not at all.

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,839
But it's just a dinner with him.

30
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,279
Is this really necessary
to wear like this?

31
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,960
Come on. Xiaosu.

32
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,800
Our Xiaosu is the most beautiful girl.

33
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,880
You're so beautiful.

34
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:54,560
(Nanpu Bridge)

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
The dress doesn't fit?

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,759
Why not wear the one I gave you?

37
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,839
It fits well.

38
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,839
I'm just not used to it.

39
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,759
Do I look poor

40
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,600
as I dress like this today?

41
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,119
You look nice in any outfits.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,759
That's great.

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,320
Besides,

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,639
the dinner is hosted for you.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,320
Why do I look so good?

46
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,800
Why should I be so conspicuous?

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,119
You're with me.

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,080
Tonight,

49
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,080
it'll be difficult for you
to keep a low profile.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,839
Why?

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,240
There must be a lot of people.

52
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,080
Is there still time for me
to go back and get changed?

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
It doesn't matter.

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
Don't worry.

55
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,800
You are glamorous

56
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,199
in any outfits.

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,360
Don't give me such expensive gifts
anymore.

58
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,160
I don't think they're necessary.

59
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,959
Fine. I promise you.

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,799
As long as you're happy.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,679
Come on. Let's drink a toast.

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
All right. Cheers.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
It's been a while.

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
We're all friends here.

65
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Relax.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,640
I'll try my best to stop you
from drinking later.

67
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,600
They'll make fun of you.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Never mind.

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Don't take it seriously.

70
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,559
Wait for a moment.

71
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,720
Who is this?

72
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,359
Mr. Lei.

73
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,839
Oh Mr. Lei. Mr. Lei.

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Your driving skills are getting worse.

75
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,839
You've been so late.

76
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,200
Come on. Please.

77
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,079
You brat. Look at yourself.

78
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Come on. Buddies.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,480
Tonight I play the host
to welcome my buddy.

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,559
First,

81
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,119
celebrate the return of my buddy
to Shanghai.

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,399
Second,

83
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,239
I wish you a comeback
and a bright future.

84
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,600
Third,

85
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,799
you've already seen it.

86
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,040
I'll just leave it there.

87
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:37,000
Come on. Cheers!

88
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,040
Cheers!

89
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,079
Cheers!

90
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,720
Xiaosu.

91
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,079
I think

92
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,320
you have known him.

93
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,799
My best cellmate, Liu Siyang.

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,839
Oh dude.

95
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,279
We've met.

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,920
Mr. Liu is so impressive.

97
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,239
Miss Du.

98
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,640
I've heard so much about you.

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,839
Come on.

100
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,880
Du Xiaosu.

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,399
Come over here.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,279
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ye.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
Yuzheng. You are not generous.

104
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,480
You shall tell me that
you have a girlfriend.

105
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,279
Last time I just felt

106
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,440
there was something between you two.

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,040
I really got it right.

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
I wonder

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,239
what can

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,279
make Mr. Lei ask me for a favor?

111
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,160
It was because of Miss Du.

112
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:31,880
Miss Du.

113
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,679
I've already told you so much.

114
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,640
You have to drink a toast.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,799
Miss Du. She can't drink.

116
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,880
She is allergic to alcohol, right?

117
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,040
Yes.

118
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,679
Who's going to ask for trouble?

119
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,600
Right.

120
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,079
Who's going to ask for trouble?

121
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,519
I will drink a toast!

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,239
Excuse me?

123
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,600
Miss Du. You can't drink?

124
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,320
I've seen it before.

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,320
You can hold your liquor.

126
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,720
What's up, Designer Du?

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,040
Are you afraid of

128
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
being carried back again by my buddy?

129
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:19,920
That is out of expectation.

130
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,399
Being carried back?

131
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,320
All right. Cheers!

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,880
Cheers!

133
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,880
Yuzheng.

134
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,760
It's really you!

135
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,160
Why is she here?

136
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,519
It must be fate for us.

137
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,000
It's been a while.

138
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,160
Where have you been?

139
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,359
I have been abroad.

140
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,679
How long are you going to stay
this time?

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,679
I was planning to leave
the day after tomorrow.

142
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,519
But I've changed my mind when I see you.

143
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,760
Xuyou.

144
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,399
You're too partial.

145
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,920
Come on. I accompanied you every time
you came back.

146
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,359
I've never heard that

147
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,079
you would stay one more day for me.

148
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,079
That's it.

149
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,359
You're too partial!

150
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,559
Shangguan is jealous.

151
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,359
Come on. Drink.

152
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Come here. Let me introduce you.

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,480
Xiaosu.

154
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,760
This is my girlfriend, Du Xiaosu.

155
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,839
Xu You.

156
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,760
The famous celebrity Xu You.

157
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
Nice to meet you. Miss Du.

158
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,239
Nice to meet you.

159
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,480
I want to talk with you.

160
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,400
Miss Du. Shall we?

161
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,440
Wait for a moment. I'll come back soon.

162
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,559
Why bring me here?

163
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,799
Anything important?

164
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,880
No. It's just
there were too many people there.

165
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,119
It was not convenient to talk.

166
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,359
How are you doing recently?

167
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
As you see,

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,599
I have a girlfriend now.

169
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,559
Let's have a drink.

170
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,799
Come on. Be happy!

171
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,719
Come on. Cheers!

172
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,359
Come on!

173
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,559
Come on. Cheers!

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,599
Fine.

175
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,520
Why are you so alert?

176
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't worry. I won't pester you.

177
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,119
It's been a while.

178
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,039
I am already not the one I used to be.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,919
Yes.

180
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,719
You're different than before.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're  more beautiful.

182
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,719
Really?

183
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,960
You're not used to
this kind of occasion, right?

184
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,159
Aren't you the same?

185
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,320
It's different for me.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,840
I've been used to wandering alone.

187
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
I might just disappear some day.

188
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,479
You're different.

189
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm afraid
you have to get used to it gradually.

190
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,080
Come on. Cheers.

191
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
Come on. Cheers.

192
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,679
Xu You.

193
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,760
I was too young before.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,479
I didn't know
how to deal with relationship.

195
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Now...

196
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,520
It's not getting any better now.

197
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,880
It has been difficult
for all the girls who are with me.

198
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,760
Difficult. That's accurate.

199
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,359
I'm kidding.

200
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,400
My number remains unchanged.

201
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,159
Call me when you're available.

202
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,679
Let's have a nice chat.

203
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,159
Come on.

204
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,039
Are you making a fool of us?

205
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,039
Come on.

206
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,359
We're waiting for you.

207
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,559
Come on.

208
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,559
Come on. Let me tell you.

209
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,359
We today... I...and...

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
Where is Xiaosu?

211
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,799
She went to the bathroom.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,760
Here. Fill the glass for Yuzheng.

213
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,400
What's the matter?

214
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,599
You just had one glass.

215
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,960
Who are you sharing it with?

216
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:16,000
(Entrepreneur)

217
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:19,872
(Community Meeting Soon)

218
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,080
The women he is dating with

219
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,000
has to be a celebrity,

220
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,719
like Xuyou, right?

221
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,440
Miss Du.

222
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,239
You're different.

223
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm afraid
you have to get used to it gradually.

224
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,136
(Lei Yuzheng)

225
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,119
Why did you leave?

226
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,159
I was a little tired.

227
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,000
So I left first.

228
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,760
Why didn't you let me take you home?

229
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,159
No, thanks. I'm almost home.

230
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,359
Don't worry.

231
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,479
Your current girlfriend

232
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,520
will have conflict with
your ex-girlfriend.

233
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,960
They can't meet each other.

234
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,280
Just go back and pamper her.

235
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,719
No big deal.

236
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,400
Everyone comes for you today.

237
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,119
You can't let everyone down.

238
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:53,559
By the way,

239
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,119
where is Fanlv?

240
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,760
Why isn't she here?

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,599
You have seen her recently, right?

242
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
Fanlv.

243
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,119
She is not very well recently.

244
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,919
During the time you're not around,

245
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,119
Lin Xiangyuan and she
were not very well.

246
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,799
She lost her baby,

247
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,679
got hurt,

248
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,520
and lost weight as well.

249
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,359
Fanlv has been listening to you
since she was a kid.

250
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,080
Go to see her when you're available.

251
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,119
Ok.

252
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,320
Lin Xiangyuan.

253
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
What did you do?

254
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,359
Do you think I don't know that?

255
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,599
I...

256
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm begging you.

257
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,400
Don't force me, okay?

258
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,960
I didn't force you

259
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,679
to come this far.

260
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,080
You have made great efforts.

261
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,359
Everything you've got is in vain.

262
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,119
Because I'm the real master of Yutian.

263
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,320
You're just an employee.

264
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,719
How can you win out?

265
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,919
You think those minority
shareholders are on your side.

266
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,719
Does it work?

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,640
As long as
I change the strategy,

268
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,960
they will be afraid of
losing their positions.

269
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,320
Since you have taken first step,

270
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,200
you're doomed

271
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,159
to failure.

272
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:07,232
(Lei Yuzheng: Meet someone with me
at noon tomorrow.)

273
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,952
(I can't go,
as I have to work in studio.)

274
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,976
(He engages in the building materials,
and it's good for you to meet him.)

275
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:06,080
(I'm really busy, and I don't like
socializing. Please go by yourself.)

276
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,159
Beauty. Alone?

277
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's have a drink.

278
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,000
Let go of me.

279
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,640
Come on. Let's have a drink.

280
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,760
Let's have a drink.

281
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,200
Let go of me.

282
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,400
Beauty. Just one drink.

283
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,840
Everybody is here for fun.
Be relaxed.

284
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,799
Yuzheng.

285
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,319
Why are you here?

286
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,560
Fanlv.

287
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,280
You are so drunk.

288
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Where is Lin Xiangyuan？

289
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,680
He? He's busy with the work all day
and doesn't even care about me.

290
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,119
I have known everything about you.

291
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,719
I'll find a way to help you.

292
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,439
But you have to pull yourself together.

293
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,599
You help me?

294
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,640
How will you help me?

295
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,800
You guys

296
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,839
only care about your own
winning and losing.

297
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,719
Do you care about our feelings?

298
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,959
You have no idea
what kind of life I've been living.

299
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,079
Of course I know.

300
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,359
Fanlv.

301
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,959
Shangguan has told me everything.

302
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,800
I wanna have a talk with Lin Xiangyuan.

303
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,239
About what?

304
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're trying to persuade him
to be nice to me,

305
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,160
right?

306
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,520
Let me tell you.

307
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,359
He's been nice to me.

308
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,079
It's you.

309
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,160
Lei Yuzheng.

310
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,880
Are you really not going back to Yutian?

311
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,439
Are you really going to
give up Yutian to others?

312
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,760
If Lin Xiangyuan
is really capable enough

313
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,439
to lead Yutian forward,

314
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,280
it will be fine.

315
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I really can't believe

316
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,479
you can say that!

317
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,079
Are you still the Lei Yuzheng
I used to know?

318
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,560
I look down on you.

319
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,479
You're a coward!

320
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,280
Mr. Lei.

321
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,560
What a coincidence!

322
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,880
Fanlv is drunk. Take her home.

323
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,959
I didn't get you.

324
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,239
Fanlv is my wife.

325
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,439
It's my business
whether to take her home or not.

326
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,839
Do I need you to remind me?

327
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,680
As the family of Fanlv,

328
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,359
I hope you can take good care of her.

329
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,479
That's my business
whether I treat her well or not.

330
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,680
You're thinking too much.

331
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,800
It's late.

332
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,800
Take her home.

333
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,239
Slow down.

334
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,560
Slow down.

335
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,959
Fanlv.

336
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,280
Have some millet porridge.

337
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,479
Come on. Let me feed you.

338
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,239
Fanlv. Are you still mad at me?

339
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,800
Have some more.

340
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,479
The millet was sent

341
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,800
at the request of my mom.

342
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,079
She knows I'm usually busy with the work

343
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,359
and always drinking.

344
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,880
So some millet porridge
will be good for health.

345
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,520
What?

346
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,040
You don't know me?

347
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,280
No.

348
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,680
Fanlv.

349
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,479
After the graduation
from the university,

350
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,400
I've been working following your dad.

351
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,680
Then in Shanghai

352
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,839
I finally settled down.

353
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,680
I spent all my money

354
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,000
on an apartment.

355
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,760
After I got the key,

356
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,959
the first thing I did was

357
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,800
going back to my hometown by train

358
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,800
and bringing my mom to Shanghai.

359
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,560
I wanted her to know that

360
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,040
her son already settled down
in the big city.

361
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,719
And I took her

362
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,560
to the most famous places
for local food in Shanghai,

363
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,160
and to the best places for shopping.

364
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,319
Guess what?

365
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,680
My mom ended up in hospital
the next day,

366
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,400
with diarrhea and vomiting.

367
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,920
The doctor examined her several times,

368
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,719
but couldn't find out the reason.

369
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,680
I was also very confused.

370
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,000
Later my mom told me,

371
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,920
it was because she didn't
get acclimatized.

372
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,280
Isn't that ridiculous?

373
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,599
In fact, my mother and I

374
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,800
shared the same feelings.

375
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,680
I've been working so hard.

376
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,040
I've been working so hard
to strive for success.

377
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,760
When I finally settled down,

378
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,079
I realized

379
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,400
I didn't get acclimatized.

380
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,599
I know exactly

381
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,599
on the way to success,

382
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,680
I've hurt a lot of people.

383
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,839
Even my beloved wife

384
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,400
is going to leave me.

385
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,239
Lin Xiangyuan.

386
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,719
What is the real you like?

387
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,760
Fanlv.

388
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,319
I did something wrong before.

389
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,359
I hope you can give me an opportunity.

390
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,079
I only wanna be a good son now,

391
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,040
a good husband, and a good son-in-law.

392
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,199
Lin Xiangyuan.

393
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,439
I can believe what you've just said
for the moment.

394
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,479
It's all from your heart.

395
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,479
But I wanna ask you.

396
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,800
Why do you change all of a sudden?

397
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,040
Before tonight,

398
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,239
you were not like this.

399
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,239
Is it because Lei Yuzheng is back?

400
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,760
Fanlv.

401
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,959
Do I need a reason to be nice to you?

402
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
I know.

403
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,800
In this world,

404
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,880
the person you're most scared of is
Lei Yuzheng.

405
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,079
I really can't figure out
what reason

406
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,239
can make you change your mind.

407
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,439
Maybe you're really scared
deep in your heart.

408
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,119
What are you being scared of?

409
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,000
I, Lin Xiangyuan,
have never been scared of anyone.

410
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,280
Probably my change now

411
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,640
is a little difficult for you
to accept.

412
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Don't worry.

413
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,280
I'll gradually prove it to you.

414
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,000
Then tell me.

415
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,439
How come you change all of sudden?

416
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,719
Then tell me.

417
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,160
How come you change all of sudden?

418
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,000
I live this easy life
every day

419
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,560
with you, the capitalist.

420
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,760
My ability

421
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,599
is going to be impaired by you.

422
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,239
What are they?

423
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,800
Any soy milk and fried dough sticks?
Get me some.

424
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,439
I saw Lin Xiangyuan.

425
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,640
Last night.

426
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,000
You should've been right.

427
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,160
Therefore,

428
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:48,040
you have already taken actions.

429
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Or else? Don't you really think

430
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:52,000
I'll sit back and do nothing?

431
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,920
Good job! Lei Yuzheng.

432
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,400
I've taken you to meet
so many friends recently.

433
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:57,800
Don't you really think

434
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,680
I was in the jail for so long
that I am desperate for feast.

435
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
You want to know the current situation
as soon as possible.

436
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,079
Most of my friends around me

437
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:06,839
are closely related to

438
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,479
Yutian.

439
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,359
As long as you get in touch with them,

440
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
you'll know everything.

441
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,040
Then what have you learned?

442
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,719
He, Lin Xiangyuan, has been scared.

443
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,920
He wants to find out something from me.

444
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
Really?

445
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,760
When a man

446
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,319
has ambitions in his career,

447
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,400
though the approaches he adopted were
disgraceful approaches,

448
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I still regard him
as a strong opponent.

449
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,239
Yes.

450
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,880
Tell me more.

451
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,959
What do you know about Lin Xiangyuan?

452
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Lin Xiangyuan has gained
initial control of the company.

453
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,959
As a smart guy,

454
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,959
he should've known that

455
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,479
this kind of power won't last long.

456
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,439
He must think of another way.

457
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Shangguan told me

458
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,680
Fanlv was going to
divorce Lin Xiangyuan.

459
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,239
If they get divorced,

460
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,079
he'll lose everything.

461
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,000
Last night you met him...

462
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,520
In order to warn him

463
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,319
to behave.

464
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,400
Warn him?

465
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,239
You're already the largest shareholder
of Yutian.

466
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,239
Why don't you just
take over the company?

467
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,880
Why bother yourself warning him?

468
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,280
I'd like to.

469
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,239
But have you ever thought about it?

470
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,359
Uncle Jiang is also
the major shareholder of Yutian.

471
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,319
Why didn't he
take action on Lin Xiangyuan?

472
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,560
That's easy.

473
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,119
Lin Xiangyuan is his son-in-law.

474
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,319
I think

475
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,239
it's not as simple as you think.

476
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,800
Before I get to the bottom of it,

477
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,680
I won't go back.

478
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,119
What do you want to do?

479
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,400
One word.

480
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,000
Wait.

481
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,119
Wait?

482
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,920
I learned one thing in the prison.

483
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,239
In a war,

484
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,800
the most powerful weapon

485
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,359
is not the money or the power

486
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,040
but the time.

487
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,599
So I've been waiting.

488
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,719
Waiting for the other side
to mess things up.

489
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,640
Waiting for them
to expose their fatal flaws.

490
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,959
Anyway,

491
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,760
you always have to make the first move.

492
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
What are we going to do?

493
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,119
Take you out

494
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
to feast.

495
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,079
I like people like you,

496
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,920
flexible and vigorous .

497
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,640
Get in the car.

498
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,479
Ok.

499
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,719
What's wrong between
you and Lei Yuzheng?

500
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,439
I think

501
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:51,359
there are really big differences
between us.

502
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,800
That is for sure.

503
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,319
Do you think it's that easy
to marry a rich guy?

504
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,760
Playing mahjong for social contact.

505
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,000
Nail down a deal at dinner.

506
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,880
There are a lot to learn in this.

507
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,040
Probably someone is more suitable
for this kind of life than me.

508
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,599
Come on.

509
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,359
If you really love Lei Yuzheng,

510
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,839
you really have to

511
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
be tolerant.

512
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,959
You have to get yourself used to
his social circle.

513
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,199
At the very least,

514
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,280
It's just other's

515
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,880
talk about you behind your back.

516
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,160
They might say that
you are a social climber.

517
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
So what?

518
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,680
But you just left like that.

519
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,560
How could he not be embarassed?

520
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,439
I didn't leave because of that.

521
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,880
Forget it.

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,199
Silly girl like you

523
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,119
can't see the restrictions
at dinner.

524
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,880
If you really don't like it

525
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,199
and feel a lot of pressure,

526
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,520
I can only support you

527
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,319
to back off as soon as possible.

528
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,599
Qunfei.

529
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,560
Have a seat.

530
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,000
Xiaosu.

531
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,160
Have you met Mr. Lei recently?

532
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,760
How is he?

533
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,920
Xiaosu.

534
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,880
Qunfei is stubborn.

535
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,680
You just cannot figure it out.

536
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,079
Don't blame me for speaking frankly.

537
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,319
We and Lei Yuzheng

538
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,119
are not in the same social status.

539
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,520
No more expectation.

540
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,680
It'll be nice to marry someone

541
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,599
with the same social status.

542
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,040
Dad. Have a seat.

543
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,959
Dad. I've prepared something
to eat.

544
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,719
I don't know
whether you like it.

545
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
Take a seat.

546
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,680
Xiangyuan.

547
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:59,800
I understand how you feel.

548
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,079
The reason why we've ended up
in situations like this,

549
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,959
is the contradiction
among us,

550
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,719
the contradiction among me, you and
Lei's family.

551
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,880
It is my fault.

552
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:16,920
I want to apologize

553
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,079
to Lei Yuzheng in person  one day.

554
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,079
If the conflict is not solved, it is
harmful for the development of Yutian.

555
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:30,719
I hope you and me can
apologize to Lei Yuzheng

556
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:35,040
and ask him
to come back to Yutian

557
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,640
as my assistant.

558
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,079
You can still be the president.

559
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,160
Will you?

560
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,119
Yes, dad.

561
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,959
I'll set a date with him.

562
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,400
Mr. Jiang

563
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,920
asked you to invite Lei Yuzheng
to come back in person?

564
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,920
What are you going to do
if he comes back?

565
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,319
Xie Li.

566
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,439
Do you know what my title is
in the group?

567
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,280
Yes, you're Mr. Lin.

568
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,479
No.

569
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm the son-in-law of Jiang Jin.

570
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,239
Jiang Fanlv's husband.

571
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,599
I signed a prenuptial agreement.

572
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,959
If I get divorced
for my personal reasons,

573
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,319
not only can I not get any shares,

574
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,479
but I'll also lose everything in Yutian.

575
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:38,160
What are you going to do then?

576
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
What to do?

577
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,319
I have no idea.

578
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,880
It's all a mirage.

579
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,079
It's all

580
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,280
in vain.

581
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,199
Dude.

582
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:18,959
What are we doing here?

583
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,560
Fishing.

584
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:21,840
Fishing?

585
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,159
I've been fishing for a whole morning.

586
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,520
Let alone the fish.
There aren't even aquatic plants.

587
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,080
This is the charm of fishing
in the wild.

588
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,719
If you can't be patient,

589
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,479
you won't catch the big fish.

590
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:45,152
(Lin Xiangyuan)

591
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,520
Ok. See you later.

592
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,120
What's the matter?

593
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,560
Lin Xiangyuan asked me to have dinner.

594
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,760
Banquet at Hongmen?

595
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,280
Yuzheng.

596
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,600
I've been working with your dad
for my whole life.

597
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,000
I've been competing with him
all my life.

598
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,159
Now I'm old.

599
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:26,879
Yutian should be handed over

600
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,399
to young people like you.

601
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,239
I was wrong about what I've done before.

602
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,840
You're a generous person.

603
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,520
If you can forgive me,

604
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,159
that would be my great privilege.

605
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,360
I can't promise anything else.

606
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,520
Lin Xiangyuan.

607
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,520
What is the real you like?

608
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,080
I'll manage the company well

609
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,120
and I will be answerable to
you and Mr. Lei.

610
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,280
Dad.

611
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,679
After Mr. Lei passed away,

612
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,600
it shocked me.

613
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,360
I've made a clear statement about

614
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,800
the company's shares
and family property.

615
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,159
Therefore,

616
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,679
I made a will with my lawyer.

617
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,176
You and Fanlv can check it out.

618
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:08,096
(Bequest Distribution Plan)

619
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,080
After my death,

620
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,959
all my shares in Yutian

621
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,080
will be inherited by Fanlv.

622
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,800
But the house property

623
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,600
belongs to you and Fanlv together.

624
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,600
Dad.

625
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,719
You're in good health.

626
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,439
I have nothing else to worry about.

627
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,800
I just hope you two

628
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,879
can be happy.

629
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,679
Dad.

630
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,919
Fanlv and I are planning

631
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,800
to have a grandson for you.

632
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,120
Aren't we, Fanlv?

633
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,679
Dad. Stop talking about these things.

634
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,800
You have to be good.

635
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,919
Xie Li.

636
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,479
Do you know

637
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,280
what is the most important thing
to do after getting married?

638
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,199
Mr. Lin. You can't drink any more.

639
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,439
Having a baby.

640
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,679
Be honest with me.

641
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,600
How have I treated Jiang Fanlv?

642
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,479
Good.

643
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,959
I'll tell you one more thing.

644
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,479
Jiang Fanlv,

645
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,080
because she just lost the baby,

646
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,719
is still using contraception.

647
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,136
(Levonorgestrel Tablets)

648
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,000
Let me tell you.

649
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,600
Jiang Jin made a will.

650
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
His property has nothing to do with me,

651
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,719
unless we have a baby.

652
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,000
Everything is unreal!

653
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,639
Unreal!

654
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,199
It's all in vain.

655
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:25,719
Mr. Lin. Don't be upset.

656
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,040
Listen to me.

657
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,199
I've been with you for so long.

658
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,560
I can tell

659
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,840
you're quite capable.

660
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,520
Where there is life, there is hope.

661
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,080
Are there still opportunities for me?

662
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,280
Yes.

663
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,919
You're a talent.

664
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,520
No matter where you work,
you will have a successful career.

665
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:48,199
Ok.

666
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,159
I won't go anywhere.

667
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,280
I will stay in Yutian.

668
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,280
Let's have a drink!

669
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,760
