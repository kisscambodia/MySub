1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:08,067
NEVERTHELESS,

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,087
NEVERTHELESS,

3
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,004
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,795
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:18,164
You smell of cigarettes.

6
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,962
Should we continue after I brush my teeth?

7
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:26,380
What?

8
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:28,883
The others must be waiting. Let's go back.

9
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,554
<i>I did it.</i>

10
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:48,903
EPISODE 3: IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.
NEVERTHELESS,

11
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,179
<i>What is this emotion?</i>

12
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,565
<i>I hope it's just love.</i>

13
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,236
<i>Not childish jealousy.</i>

14
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:30,171
Something seems to be going on
between Na-bi and Jae-eon, right?

15
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,590
-Why do you say so?
-Those two

16
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,925
disappeared for a while last night.

17
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,762
And it seemed like something happened
between them.

18
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:39,889
I could tell from her expression.

19
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:43,684
And I saw them whispering something
by the door early in the morning.

20
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:46,354
I couldn't hear what they said though.

21
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:47,772
Are you the only one who saw?

22
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:50,816
Yes, and I didn't tell Bit-na.
Good thing I didn't, right?

23
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,902
-Good thinking.
-I'm starving.

24
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,446
The noodles are here.

25
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,075
It looks so good!

26
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:02,411
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

27
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,288
And don't say anything to Na-bi.

28
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:05,915
Don't worry.

29
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,708
I'm going to steal this from you!

30
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,093
Would it be okay though?

31
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:19,095
What? Your belly fat?

32
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:22,181
No! I mean Na-bi.

33
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:25,893
She's probably having a hard time
after breaking up with her ex.

34
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:29,188
She could get involved in gossip
by hanging out with him.

35
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:32,900
I don't think
she should be seeing Jae-eon.

36
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,068
Really?

37
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:38,322
I think Jae-eon is better than her ex.

38
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:41,158
What? Really? Why?

39
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,914
I don't know. I can just feel it.

40
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,041
They look good together.

41
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:55,798
Got drunk and kissed…

42
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,967
RECENT SEARCHES
KISSING SOMEONE BEFORE DATING

43
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,678
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHO I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR

44
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:04,014
I MADE A MISTAKE WHILE DRUNK
EVERYONE THINKS WEIRDLY OF ME

45
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,392
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

46
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,311
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER
WAS IT JUST A DRUNKEN MISTAKE?

47
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,814
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
ONCE YOU'VE TOUCHED FIRST BASE

48
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:13,983
YOU'LL END UP BECOMING SP
OR DRIFTING APART

49
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:16,193
"SP"?

50
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,489
"SP"? As in…

51
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,993
"Sex partners"?

52
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,328
Na-bi.

53
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:29,582
You startled me.

54
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:30,958
What were you looking at?

55
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,878
Just looking for some references.

56
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:39,675
Sol.

57
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:44,138
If you want to kiss someone,

58
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:49,018
does that mean you want
to sleep with them as well?

59
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,313
Are you asking about me?

60
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:55,191
Or is it about you?

61
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:57,902
What? Me?

62
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:01,280
No, it's not about me.

63
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:06,160
I mean, generally. I just want to know
how people usually feel.

64
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:09,955
I'm just trying to come up
with an idea for my assignment.

65
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,208
I'm not sure.

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,544
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

67
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,631
The other person…

68
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,585
SEOL-A

69
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,047
<i>I just got on the plane!</i>

70
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,513
One-night…

71
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,308
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

72
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:15,020
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

73
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:16,021
"The other person"?

74
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:19,608
You may want to kiss and have sex
with someone,

75
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:23,654
or you might kiss someone
and not want to go further.

76
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:27,908
So in the end, it depends
on who the other person is.

77
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:29,994
<i>Then what kind of person</i>

78
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,746
<i>am I to him?</i>

79
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,208
ONE-NIGHT STAND?

80
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,228
PARK JAE-EON

81
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:59,607
SHOULDN'T WE TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY?

82
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,318
<i>Would I seem too clingy?</i>

83
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,373
-Hey!
-Hi!

84
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:19,293
Hey, Na-bi.

85
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,711
Hi.

86
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,422
My battery's dead again.
Maybe I should get a new phone.

87
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,592
-Where's Ji-wan?
-She's meeting someone.

88
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,427
-What are you doing?
-I need a charger.

89
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,804
She's watching a movie
with her blind date.

90
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,598
She doesn't care much about school.

91
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:35,434
Let's see…

92
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,562
<i>I want to ask</i>

93
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:44,902
<i>what I should say to get Jae-eon
to tell me how he really feels about me.</i>

94
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:46,945
Do you really like that guy?

95
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,739
-Yes.
-You don't look that way.

96
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:50,699
Do you dance excitedly

97
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:52,951
whenever you like someone's post?

98
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:54,536
That's different though.

99
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,668
Why would you sleep with someone

100
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:04,922
you're not even dating?

101
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:07,132
Isn't that meaningless?

102
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,342
Gosh.

103
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:12,179
Why do you always associate sex
with dating? Are you that old-fashioned?

104
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:14,139
-Watch your mouth.
-Lower your voice!

105
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:16,767
-Someone might hear you.
-I'm not saying anything wrong.

106
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,436
I can say it even louder! Should I?

107
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,563
Let's begin class!

108
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,733
All right, let's begin class.

109
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:28,028
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

110
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,697
-Hello.
-Hello.

111
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,454
Try this.

112
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:41,792
-You're not with your cute friend today.
-She's hanging out with someone else.

113
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,461
She must be having fun.
I'll get you your food right away.

114
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,547
Thank you. Give us a large serving.

115
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,798
All right.

116
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,300
You must be a regular here.

117
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:53,595
Yes. My friend loves this place.

118
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,515
But this place is quite famous
in this neighborhood.

119
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,351
Danpunggol was the most popular
when I was in school.

120
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,854
You went to school here?

121
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,564
Yes. I was an Economics major.

122
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,316
-I graduated two years ago.
-I see.

123
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,616
I'm really sorry about last time.

124
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,994
I put in an estimated amount.

125
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:19,371
Tell me if it's not enough.

126
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,039
It's really fine.

127
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,293
It's okay. Keep it.

128
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,635
This isn't why I asked to see you.

129
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:36,096
Sorry? Then why…

130
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,102
Here's your food.

131
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,022
It's hot, so be careful. Enjoy.

132
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,064
Thank you.

133
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,277
-What's wrong?
-You're really strong.

134
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:51,945
Do you work out?

135
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,281
Oh, I major in sculpture.

136
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:58,202
I always work with clay,
so I have a lot of strength in my hands.

137
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,711
Just buy me this meal. That's enough.

138
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:11,715
I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.

139
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:16,929
-Then buy me coffee, too.
-I'll buy dessert as well.

140
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,306
Okay.

141
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,184
-Like this?
-Yes.

142
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,436
-Do it like that.
-Thank you.

143
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,987
That's it for today.

144
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,698
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

145
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:39,535
The weather is so nice today.

146
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,453
You should all go on a date.

147
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:43,455
-Okay.
-Come on.

148
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:46,583
Why aren't you answering?

149
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,460
Don't tell me you guys are all single.

150
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:53,882
You should at least
have one proper relationship at your age.

151
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:57,594
What they say about art
coming from loneliness is nonsense.

152
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:02,140
Dating is the best way
to get inspiration for art.

153
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:04,434
She's at it again.

154
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,311
Didn't she say class was over?

155
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:09,398
Love is what can make
even the roughest person become

156
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:13,110
as soft as sand on a beach.

157
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:16,530
I can't believe you guys.

158
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,407
You guys are art majors, you know.

159
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:20,576
They have no inspiration.

160
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:25,497
One student told me a while ago

161
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,833
that he doesn't want a relationship.

162
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,793
He just wants to flirt and date around.

163
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:34,631
Basically, he wants to have fun
with no strings attached.

164
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:37,301
He should have one-night stands instead.

165
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:39,803
It's so sad, isn't it?

166
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:41,763
Goodness.

167
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:45,642
Find your inspirations, all right?

168
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:47,352
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's what art is.

169
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,021
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

170
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:52,024
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for today.

171
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:05,954
PARK YE-SOM, KANG SEO-YEON, LEE YE-HWA

172
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:07,080
YU NA-BI

173
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:15,088
I'M BUYING ART SUPPLIES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

174
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:23,930
Jae-eon.

175
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:28,977
Welcome back.

176
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:31,188
You've gotten more handsome.

177
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:39,279
You must've enjoyed it, Ji-wan.

178
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:42,616
Yes, it was so fun.
It was much better than I expected.

179
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,619
-I want to watch it again with my friend.
-Your friend?

180
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,039
-It's not a guy, right?
-It's a girl, of course.

181
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,750
Her name's Sol. She's been my bestie
since middle school.

182
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,127
I think she'll enjoy it, too.

183
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:55,253
I'll watch it with her.

184
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,216
Then Ji-wan,

185
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,718
watch it again with me next time, too.

186
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,971
Well, okay.

187
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,640
But you didn't seem to enjoy it
as much as I did.

188
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,642
I really enjoyed it too.

189
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:12,729
It wasn't what I expected though.

190
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,732
-What do you mean?
-I thought it would be about romance,

191
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,068
but it was about friendship.

192
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:20,821
Oh. Friendship?

193
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:24,324
I felt that it was clearly about love,

194
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:26,368
but I guess you could've seen it that way.

195
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,328
Still, it was good.

196
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:33,083
If you're hungry, should we go eat?

197
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,085
Yes. I'm really hungry.

198
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:39,214
I said I'd buy. Why did you pay?

199
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:44,052
Well, I didn't think it'd be enough
to repay me.

200
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,014
I knew it.

201
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:55,856
Can you pay next time?

202
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,442
I'd like to see you again.

203
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:00,902
Why?

204
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:05,574
It was fun hearing about your projects.

205
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,161
-You ate…
-I eat quite a lot.

206
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,371
Hey, it's Sol.

207
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:13,331
She's the friend I just told you about.

208
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:16,543
That's strange.
I'm not really a smooth talker.

209
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,754
No, I really enjoyed listening to you.

210
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:22,632
Who's that next to her?

211
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:24,468
Where are you headed now?

212
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:26,636
I'm taking the bus here.

213
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,723
-I'll come with you.
-No, I can go by myself.

214
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,352
Why don't you try calling her?

215
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,104
No, it's fine.

216
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,941
You two must be really close.

217
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,277
Yes.

218
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:44,446
Let's go.

219
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,743
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

220
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,776
I'm so hungry.

221
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:31,284
<i>Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.</i>

222
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:39,793
<i>I don't know if he just doesn't care
about me or if he's teasing me.</i>

223
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:42,712
<i>But whichever it is,</i>

224
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,173
<i>it sucks.</i>

225
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,893
<i>I hate to admit it,</i>

226
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,148
<i>but I can't take my eyes off him
once he comes into my sight.</i>

227
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:01,750
Hey, Seol-a.

228
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,544
I knew it was you.

229
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,964
Hang on. I'll be there soon.

230
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:34,741
<i>Who is Seol-a?</i>

231
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,079
Seol-a.

232
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,339
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-It's okay.

233
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,050
-<i>Who is she…</i>
-Should we get something to drink?

234
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,468
-<i>to make him smile…</i>
-Okay.

235
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:54,928
-<i>like that?</i>
-Let's go.

236
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:10,026
<i>You're so pathetic, Na-bi.</i>

237
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,195
<i>You're acting like a stalker.</i>

238
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,829
<i>I could tell right away.</i>

239
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:25,041
<i>She's the one Jae-eon's heart belongs to.</i>

240
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,547
Welcome.

241
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,507
Oh, Na-bi!

242
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,220
I sat next to you yesterday.

243
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:39,681
You stole my water, remember?

244
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,641
Oh, that's my water.

245
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:48,481
Oh, right. The freshman.
Your name is Kang Eun-han, right?

246
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:50,108
It's Kim Eun-han.

247
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,319
You're bad at remembering people.

248
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:55,030
Sorry, there were
so many people yesterday.

249
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,156
Do you work here?

250
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,283
Yes. Just in the evenings. I just started.

251
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,618
Was it fun last night?

252
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:04,873
I wanted to hang out longer,
but I had to come and work.

253
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,917
You haven't had dinner?

254
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,919
No. I was working on my assignment.

255
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:13,631
In that case. I was saving this,

256
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,675
but you can have it.

257
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,969
No, it's fine. You should have it.

258
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,346
It's okay.

259
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:21,473
I want you to have it.

260
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:23,475
Thanks.

261
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,894
I'll enjoy this.
Good luck with work, then.

262
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:27,228
Na-bi.

263
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,147
Can you give me your phone?

264
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,317
-My phone?
-Yes.

265
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:43,995
Do you know them?

266
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,123
You keep looking at them.

267
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,543
A freshman in our department.
He must work there.

268
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:51,795
Not him.

269
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:57,258
Is that girl a freshman, too?

270
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:58,760
Here's my number.

271
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,262
-I'll contact you later.
-Okay.

272
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:03,973
No. She's my senior.

273
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:07,352
Or maybe a friend.

274
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,442
-Take care, then.
-Bye.

275
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:15,985
-See you later.
-See you.

276
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,786
You're still using that?

277
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:29,249
-What about you?
-Me?

278
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:33,211
I lost it a long time ago.

279
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:37,257
That's disappointing.

280
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,011
How are your butterflies doing?

281
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,054
They're fine.

282
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:46,766
But I'm going to set them free soon.

283
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,393
Why?

284
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,271
I feel guilty.

285
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,358
They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up

286
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,110
because of me.

287
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,072
You've grown up.

288
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,660
That girl…

289
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:08,997
Her name's Na-bi.

290
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:15,044
So you haven't grown up.
You just found another butterfly.

291
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:17,172
It's not like that.

292
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,716
She's just a friend.

293
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,011
You're lying.

294
00:22:24,262 --> 00:22:26,139
Even her name is Na-bi.

295
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:28,558
Is it fate?

296
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:31,060
Don't be ridiculous.

297
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:33,313
You're my fate.

298
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:39,611
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
SLICE THE GREEN ONIONS

299
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,459
NEW MESSAGE FROM KIM EUN-HAN

300
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,294
<i>Hello, Na-bi!</i>

301
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,504
<i>It's Kim Eun-han from a moment ago.</i>

302
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:00,048
He messaged me right away.

303
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,759
<i>Right. Hi.</i>

304
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:05,053
<i>Are you coming to the flea market?</i>

305
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:06,596
<i>I'm serving at our booth!</i>

306
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,557
<i>Or you can come to the after-party.</i>

307
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,019
<i>I hope you'll come.</i>

308
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:14,854
<i>Okay, then.</i>

309
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,399
<i>Really? Then I'll see you there!</i>

310
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,490
<i>To be honest, it doesn't feel bad.</i>

311
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,586
<i>By the way, are there days
when you don't have class?</i>

312
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,422
<i>Oh, was that too personal?</i>

313
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:42,799
<i>My apologies.</i>

314
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,051
<i>Good night. See you at the festival!</i>

315
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,012
<i>Sadly, I have class every day.</i>

316
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,139
<i>Good night.</i>

317
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:57,730
PARK JAE-EON

318
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:44,986
Jae-eon!

319
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:49,991
No way! You can do glass art, too?

320
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,576
What are you making?

321
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:53,578
What?

322
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,372
Oh, I'm making a suncatcher.

323
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:58,833
It's so pretty.
You're making a butterfly again.

324
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,918
You really love butterflies, don't you?

325
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,104
What? Do you have a cold?

326
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,022
Stay away from me.

327
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:12,858
I don't know. I have a headache.

328
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:16,487
Are you sick from quitting Jae-eon?

329
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:18,114
Withdrawal symptoms?

330
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,657
What are you on about?

331
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,575
You haven't been hanging out with him.

332
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,452
Is it over now?

333
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:27,206
I don't think we really click.

334
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,169
I'm disappointed.

335
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:34,672
The quiet kids usually end up causing
huge trouble.

336
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,215
That disappoints you?

337
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:39,593
Of course. I was looking forward to
some drama. This is so boring.

338
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:45,391
You seem to want to push me into
Hell's pit just for your entertainment.

339
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,519
Come on, don't say it like that.

340
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:50,438
Like when you all came to my house.

341
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,190
Why did you have to talk about
testing him and stuff?

342
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:54,275
What about it?

343
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:58,112
Why? Did something happen
between you two that day?

344
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:12,960
I mean, it was useless
because nothing happened.

345
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:14,712
You saw what it was like.

346
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,133
Do you know what you need
to catch a big fish, Na-bi?

347
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:20,968
You're going to say "patience," right?

348
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:24,388
And he's not even a catch.

349
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:25,931
He isn't?

350
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:28,976
Well, it depends.

351
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:32,021
Anyhow, are you sure he doesn't date?

352
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,356
I'm sure. I told you.

353
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,985
Why? Did he ask you out?

354
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:42,656
No, it seemed like he was dating someone.
But maybe I'm mistaken.

355
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,909
Na-bi! Hi!

356
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:46,368
-Hi.
-Hi.

357
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:49,663
Hi, Eun-han. Are you going to eat lunch?

358
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:52,291
-Yes.
-Enjoy your lunch.

359
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,752
-You too.
-Okay.

360
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:00,841
What was that with Eun-han?

361
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,843
We got close recently.

362
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,180
Is there something about him, too?

363
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:09,266
No. Not that I know of.

364
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,605
I knew it. You're receiving attention
as soon as you come out of your bubble.

365
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:17,441
Gosh, but Eun-han's a bit boring.

366
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:20,611
Leave me out of your fun, okay?

367
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,782
So you're thinking of seeing him?

368
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,867
It's not like that.

369
00:27:29,203 --> 00:27:30,955
This is a bit disappointing.

370
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:41,382
Hi.

371
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,051
You should get some vitamins.

372
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:48,013
Thanks.

373
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:49,139
How is that going?

374
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:53,769
It's bad. I'm screwed this semester.

375
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,772
No way. You're so good.

376
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,524
What do you know?

377
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:00,317
I know quite a lot.

378
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:05,364
I actually saw your piece when I was here
for the entrance exam last year.

379
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,074
Last year?

380
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:10,911
Then it would have been…

381
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,380
<i>LOVE</i>
YU NA-BI

382
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,631
"<i>Love</i>"?

383
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:25,217
"Yu Na-bi."

384
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:30,431
<i>-The one about love?
-Yes.</i>

385
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:33,893
I got scolded for making the same thing
over and over.

386
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:36,103
I loved it. I even took a photo.

387
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:37,646
Let me see.

388
00:28:38,689 --> 00:28:42,026
There aren't many pieces
that depict love just as it is.

389
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:45,404
Everyone thinks they have to
make it look cool.

390
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:48,574
Where is it?

391
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:51,493
Oh, right. I got a new phone.

392
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:53,954
Na-bi. Could I see it again?

393
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:55,664
I promise to back up my photos.

394
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:58,876
-Well…
-Yes?

395
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,711
I threw it away.

396
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:03,547
-Really?
-<i>Because my ex was the inspiration.</i>

397
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:05,132
Is it really not here?

398
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:09,094
Thanks.

399
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:10,721
For what?

400
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:15,351
To be honest, I gave up on the piece
I was working on,

401
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:16,769
and I didn't know what to do.

402
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:19,229
But you cheered me up.

403
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:27,321
<i>He does seem pretty cute.</i>

404
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:31,116
But it's a bit awkward
since you're talking so formally to me.

405
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,117
Just talk casually.

406
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:35,329
It's hard for me to do that
to people older than me.

407
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:36,622
Oh, really?

408
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,875
All right, then. Whatever you prefer.

409
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,919
No. I'll talk casually

410
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:43,921
from now on.

411
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:45,756
Okay.

412
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,927
Na-bi, everyone said this movie was good.
Did you watch it?

413
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:56,183
No, I didn't. I haven't been
to a movie theater in a while.

414
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,893
Do you want to watch it with me?

415
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:02,648
-Is it a romantic movie?
-Yes.

416
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:08,278
Hi.

417
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:09,989
Hello.

418
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,076
Oh, hi.

419
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:17,287
What are you two talking about?

420
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,708
We're going to watch a movie together.

421
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:24,420
Should we watch something else, then?

422
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,756
-Well…
-Hey.

423
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,758
You're talking casually to her?

424
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:34,221
Were you two close?

425
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:42,396
Yes. We're close.
Closer than you and me, anyway.

426
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:47,818
Let's watch this, Eun-han.
I like romantic movies.

427
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:50,237
Okay, then.

428
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:51,989
Hey.

429
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,034
Isn't this erotic?

430
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:56,869
That's better, then.

431
00:30:57,953 --> 00:30:59,163
Let's watch it.

432
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:02,207
Right. You'll need a reference.

433
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,250
What do you mean?

434
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:04,835
The male lead.

435
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:06,879
He's a good kisser.

436
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,340
Na-bi's fussy about kisses.

437
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:14,845
Be careful because she'll push you away
if she doesn't like it.

438
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,055
See me outside.

439
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:29,234
-What was that about?
-What?

440
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:31,570
Why would you
suddenly mention kissing? Hey.

441
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:34,323
Stop playing games with me.

442
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,868
Playing games? You're the one
who pushed my hand away.

443
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,578
I never let you touch my shoulder.

444
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:41,705
There's nothing between us, you know.

445
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:44,583
-Why are you so upset?
-I'm not upset!

446
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,631
I'm not upset.

447
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:55,636
You never contacted me since that day.
You know that?

448
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:57,262
You didn't, either.

449
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,390
And what's so wrong about that?

450
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,398
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that kind of person.

451
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,111
What do you mean by that?

452
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:15,781
I thought you were enjoying it.

453
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:18,742
Don't worry.

454
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:21,245
I won't try anything with you.

455
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,207
Good luck with Eun-han.

456
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,881
Fine.

457
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,099
Well, you left your phone…

458
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,435
Right. Thanks.

459
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:47,521
Na-bi.

460
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,482
Should we go watch the movie?

461
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,904
All right.

462
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,756
Na-bi.

463
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,177
I like butterflies
way more than dragonflies.

464
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,595
You didn't eat, right?

465
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,015
This place is really amazing. Try it.

466
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:26,685
And you don't seem to be
in a good mood. So eat up.

467
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:28,854
You should eat to cheer up.

468
00:33:28,937 --> 00:33:30,230
You should eat too.

469
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:35,944
-Here, have some water.
-Thank you.

470
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,030
Na-bi. That's my water.

471
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,449
Stop that!

472
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,910
-You seemed to like water.
-Stop it.

473
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:45,495
<i>This is it.
Going on a date in the daytime.</i>

474
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,831
-Right.
-<i>Sweet and innocent attraction.</i>

475
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:57,966
I saw it!

476
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:04,348
-"Miracle"?
-"Past"?

477
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,351
That's great.

478
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:09,061
-It's open.
-Yes! It's open!

479
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:15,400
Could you take a photo of us?

480
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:16,860
Thank you.

481
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:19,363
All right, then. One, two.

482
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:23,408
Can I have a combo set, please?

483
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:25,327
Which flavor would you like?

484
00:34:26,286 --> 00:34:29,331
Well…

485
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:37,506
<i>Eating and watching a movie together,
like a normal date.</i>

486
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:39,716
<i>Something that suits me perfectly.</i>

487
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:53,855
Come on, just once.

488
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,441
One, two, three.

489
00:34:59,736 --> 00:35:02,447
It's a good photo. Let me take one of you.

490
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,325
One, two, three.

491
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:09,037
Let's eat.

492
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:11,540
Here.

493
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,461
Enjoy your meal.

494
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:22,759
This is really good.

495
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:24,177
-Is it?
-Yes.

496
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,679
<i>Why do I…</i>

497
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,432
<i>still have this on my phone?</i>

498
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:30,851
Na-bi.

499
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:34,688
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got everything.

500
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,815
Oh, okay.

501
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:39,526
-Should I buy more?
-No, it's fine. Thanks.

502
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,281
This is really tasty.

503
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:48,535
<i>Will things keep piling up like this?</i>

504
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:51,538
<i>I was a loser who was always running away.</i>

505
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:57,544
<i>But I can't run away from you.</i>

506
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:02,841
<i>I like everything about you,</i>

507
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,303
<i>and I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

508
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,515
<i>I…</i>

509
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,687
<i>I love you.</i>

510
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:25,697
What are you thinking, Na-bi?

511
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:30,160
I wasn't thinking of anything. Why?

512
00:36:30,994 --> 00:36:34,039
You didn't seem to be in a good mood
since we were in the theater.

513
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:37,626
-So I thought you didn't like the movie.
-Well…

514
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:39,920
I'm just not feeling too good.

515
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,340
It was a bit too cheesy, right?

516
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:45,050
Really?

517
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:47,886
I enjoyed it a lot.

518
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:52,766
It made me want to have
a relationship like that too.

519
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,227
I suddenly got that feeling…

520
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:03,276
Actually, I heard you and Jae-eon earlier.

521
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:07,280
Oh, I see.

522
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:12,244
-But he's…
-I know. It's over now, right?

523
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:13,620
"Over"?

524
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,671
You know that he only hurts other people.

525
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,675
Don't let someone who was never sincere
toward you hurt you.

526
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:27,843
I know…

527
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:31,763
what it's like. But it's all meaningless.

528
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:34,391
And most of all,
you two don't suit each other.

529
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:39,604
All right.

530
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:43,984
Okay.

531
00:37:56,455 --> 00:37:57,998
Sorry, Eun-han.

532
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,499
I…

533
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,252
I was about to sneeze.

534
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:03,503
Forget it.

535
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:08,008
I really did! Eun-han!

536
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,956
He is pretty cute, but…

537
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:47,631
Are you with someone?

538
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:48,965
Because you're cute.

539
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:02,521

like I did with Jae-eon.</i>

546
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:56,616
<i>You heard me.</i>

547
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,078
<i>The landlord said you can't get
an extension.</i>

548
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,830
But why?

549
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:06,042
I should've been notified
at least three months in advance, then.

550
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:09,170
-<i>Whatever. I relayed the message.</i>
-Excuse me!

551
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:12,340
What the heck?

552
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:14,092
Darn it.

553
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:15,802
Oh, my gosh!

554
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:24,477
-Na-bi!
-Hello!

555
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,896
Hey, you look really good in that.

556
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,565
Thank you, my lady.

557
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:30,525
Are you not coming to our booth?

558
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:34,362
I'm okay. How are the preparations going?

559
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:36,489
I'm sure it's going great.
They have Jae-eon.

560
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:39,326
My friends said they're coming,
but there might not be seats.

561
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,453
-You have friends?
-Of course I do!

562
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:45,999
So what will you do?
Can you find a house within a month?

563
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:49,586
If I can't, I'll have to find
a small studio or something.

564
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:51,588
Or some housemates.

565
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:54,090
What about all your stuff?

566
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:58,678
I guess I'll have to use
a storage service.

567
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:03,224
Darn it! What do I do?

568
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:05,143
The rent is expensive around here now.

569
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,896
It'll be impossible to find
another place with cheap rent.

570
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:10,190
I'm screwed!

571
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:13,193
Hey, calm down.

572
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:15,153
How much was the rent?

573
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:18,823
-Hello!
-Hello!

574
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:20,784
-Hi.
-Can we have more butane?

575
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:22,952
And where can we get more folding chairs?

576
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:24,371
In the clubroom.

577
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:25,789
Oh, right.

578
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:27,999
Tell Sol not to come to the booth.

579
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,835
She'll run into Professor Lee
and get nagged to death.

580
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,712
Why would she get nagged?

581
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:34,089
Don't you know?

582
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,091
The exchange program.

583
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:38,593
It's really exhausting for me, too.

584
00:41:38,677 --> 00:41:42,222
She'll get a full scholarship.
What's holding her back?

585
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:43,890
Some people are dying to go.

586
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:47,060
It's not an easy decision to make though.
Here you go.

587
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,687
Exchange program?

588
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,564
What? You didn't know?

589
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:53,566
-No.
-How did you not know?

590
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,027
All the professors are going.

591
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:57,404
-Let's take these.
-Okay.

592
00:41:57,904 --> 00:41:58,738
Let's go.

593
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,282
-I'll go with them.
-Bye.

594
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,492
Let's go.

595
00:42:03,993 --> 00:42:07,080
What's going on?

596
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,082
Goodness.

597
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:30,353
What are you doing here?

598
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:32,021
Nothing.

599
00:42:33,273 --> 00:42:35,191
Aren't you going to the flea market?

600
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:37,277
-Are you going to see Eun-han?
-What?

601
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:40,572
I heard something's going on
between you and him.

602
00:42:41,156 --> 00:42:43,283
-I heard everything.
-From Bit-na, right?

603
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:44,534
I'm glad.

604
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:49,038
I don't know him well,
but he's way better than Jae-eon.

605
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:57,046
Last time, when the professor
called you and Sol…

606
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,591
It was because
of the exchange program, right?

607
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:01,384
Well…

608
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:05,972
Yes.

609
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:09,726
I see.

610
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,103
But Bit-na didn't hear from Sol, either.

611
00:43:12,812 --> 00:43:15,982
Sol was probably thinking
of telling you first.

612
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:18,777
And I only heard when I met
the professor with her.

613
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:20,653
I don't know.

614
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:24,324
I bet she didn't tell me
because I'd feel upset.

615
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:26,743
Did I tell you before?

616
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:28,953
I started art because of Sol.

617
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:30,121
Really?

618
00:43:30,747 --> 00:43:31,748
I didn't know.

619
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:35,126
She wanted to major in art
since she was in middle school.

620
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,629
And I worked so hard to join her.

621
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:42,425
I thought I'd at least be able
to keep up with her if I did my best.

622
00:43:44,427 --> 00:43:46,763
But I guess there are things
you can never do.

623
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:49,349
I can barely get my assignments done.

624
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:53,353
I don't even know if I can graduate.

625
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,234
I'm so jealous of her.

626
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:02,570
That kind of presence
only comes naturally.

627
00:44:02,654 --> 00:44:03,988
Right.

628
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:07,408
Some people are gifted like that.

629
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,374
Let's go to the flea market.

630
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,502
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go.

SCULPTURE DEPARTMENT FLEA MARKET

632
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,657
Is everything going okay?

633
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:35,580
All right, the next two people. Come in.

634
00:44:35,663 --> 00:44:37,957
She's just not my type.

635
00:44:43,963 --> 00:44:45,089
Why is he here?

636
00:44:45,173 --> 00:44:48,885
I know, right? He's not even here to help.

637
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:50,845
-He's not even paying.
-Right.

638
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:52,889
He's just here to watch us.

639
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,849
-That looks nice.
-No.

640
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,060
-Here you go.
-Can I…

641
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,062
have your number?

642
00:44:59,896 --> 00:45:01,147
Sorry.

643
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,982
What was that? Namaste?

644
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:05,902
-I should use this gesture too.
-Where would you use that?

645
00:45:06,986 --> 00:45:09,447
Hey, let's go.

646
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,115
Why? You wanted to come.

647
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,785
It's too noisy and crowded in here.

648
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:16,162
-And there aren't any pretty girls.
-But there are.

649
00:45:16,245 --> 00:45:18,790
Let's just go. Come on.

650
00:45:18,873 --> 00:45:21,292
Hey, they're leaving.

651
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:22,960
-What a relief.
-Why's he leaving?

652
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:24,921
-You're leaving?
-Yes!

653
00:45:25,004 --> 00:45:27,590
Hey, they're gone. Go and serve the food.

654
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:30,593
Gosh. It's a festival,
but they're not selling drinks, Professor.

655
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:32,970
This is unbelievable.

656
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:36,265
-He really is popular, isn't he?
-This place is so nice.

657
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:38,810
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

658
00:45:38,893 --> 00:45:40,520
-You must be tired.
-Can I have your number?

659
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:43,481
-Sorry.
-They're all smiling from ear to ear.

660
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:46,693
-Are you two dating?
-What? No!

661
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:49,696
Why are you overreacting?
Kids like you always end up dating.

662
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:52,198
Professor, that's never going to happen.

663
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:54,534
Watch what you say.
It could really happen.

664
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:57,870
No way. Hey, Jin-su. Come over here.

665
00:45:57,954 --> 00:45:59,497
Professor, this is…

666
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,790
By the way,

667
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:04,877
that student over there.
He's Park Jae-eon, right?

668
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:06,504
-Yes.
-Yes.

669
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:10,383
I remember him since he's very competent.

670
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,805
I should get going.

671
00:46:15,888 --> 00:46:17,432
-Have fun.
-All right.

672
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:19,600
-Don't cause any trouble.
-Okay.

673
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:21,644
-Jin-su will show you out.
-I'll escort you.

674
00:46:21,728 --> 00:46:24,856
Okay. I have some work
to finish up, so I'll get going.

675
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:26,691
-Bye, then.
-I'll see you later.

676
00:46:26,774 --> 00:46:29,318
-Bye.
-Don't cause any trouble.

677
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:30,486
Bye, Professor.

678
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,822
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

679
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,950
I thought she'd leave
like three hours ago.

680
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:40,413
So she remembers him
because of his competency?

681
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:44,709
I bet she remembers him
because he's so handsome.

682
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:46,669
Hey, where did you steal this?

683
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:48,254
We can't sell alcohol here.

684
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:50,006
I bought it at a convenience store.

685
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,883
Can't I even do that?

686
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:55,845
You're going to drink at the after-party.
Can't you hold yourself back?

687
00:46:55,928 --> 00:46:59,766
Seriously, you nag more than my mom.

688
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:03,436
If you get drunk today, I'm really
going to abandon you on the streets.

689
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:13,905
That looks delicious.

690
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:16,491
Hey, Ji-wan! Over here.

691
00:47:16,574 --> 00:47:19,660
Hey! You got really good seats.

692
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:22,079
Why don't you join us?
I'll introduce you to them.

693
00:47:22,163 --> 00:47:23,873
No, I'm fine. Have fun.

694
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:25,374
Then call me if you get bored.

695
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,876
Okay.

696
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,878
-Have fun.
-Okay.

697
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,341
When did you come?

698
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:34,550
You should've called me.

699
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:37,887
ARTISTS THAT SHINE
LOOKING FOR ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE

700
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,603
This is the usual serving.

701
00:47:45,686 --> 00:47:48,689
But I added more
since you seemed like you'd eat a lot.

702
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,491
Eun-han.

703
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:05,206
Hey, Na-bi.

704
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,084
There are so many people.

705
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:11,337
-Our department's the most crowded.
-Right. Well…

706
00:48:12,213 --> 00:48:14,215
-Are you here with anyone?
-What?

707
00:48:14,298 --> 00:48:17,343
There are so many people.
I didn't think it'd get so crowded.

708
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:19,262
Maybe you should just go somewhere else.

709
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:22,014
No, I just came to see you for a moment.

710
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:23,224
As I promised.

711
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:28,020
Right.

712
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,397
Eun-han!

713
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,779
When do you get off?
We're thinking of getting drinks.

714
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:44,579
Who is she? Your friend?

715
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,415
She's a senior that I'm close with.

716
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh, hello.

717
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:56,215
Right. Hi.

718
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,970
Well, why don't you go ahead first?
I'll join you after I finish.

719
00:49:01,053 --> 00:49:03,264
Okay. Call me when you're done.

720
00:49:03,347 --> 00:49:04,515
All right.

721
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:12,189
-I'll see you later, then.
-It's not like that.

722
00:49:12,773 --> 00:49:16,068
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

723
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,738
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday…

724
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:26,495
I'm really sorry.

725
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,039
All right.

726
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,799
Let's begin the game. Se-hun?

727
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:41,344
-All right. Let's spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

728
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:43,471
-That looks fun.
-Let's try that later.

729
00:49:44,055 --> 00:49:44,972
Speed quiz!

730
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:47,266
-Is it only for couples?
-I don't think so.

731
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,269
By the way, that guy has a crush
on Sol, right?

732
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:51,896
You got it right!

733
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:53,522
-Right or…
-Wrong.

734
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:55,775
How would I know?

735
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,111
I'm sure of it. I told him we were
Sol's friends,

736
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:00,780
and he gave us so much food.

737
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:03,616
Sol's not that close to him.

738
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:07,203
Well, since you two are so close.
Don't you get sick of each other?

739
00:50:08,996 --> 00:50:11,958
We don't hang out as much as we did
these days.

740
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,835
Right. You've been dating a lot.

741
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,462
-Spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

742
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:19,465
-Spin!
-But I kind of feel sorry for him.

743
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:23,260
If Sol goes to the States, she'll be
hanging out with hot American guys.

744
00:50:23,344 --> 00:50:26,973
Wasn't she going to England?
It seemed like she was going to Europe.

745
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:28,766
Is she really going though? When?

746
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:30,559
How did you guys know?

747
00:50:30,643 --> 00:50:33,062
What do you mean?
Can I have some of your juice?

748
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:34,939
-Here.
-Thanks.

749
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,150
Hey, there's Sol!

750
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:39,527
She's with someone though.

751
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,695
Hey, Sol!

752
00:50:40,778 --> 00:50:42,530
Isn't he the guy from the café?

753
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:45,032
Hey, I think he is.

754
00:50:46,325 --> 00:50:47,535
Hi, I'm Jung Ju-hyeok.

755
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:49,870
-Hi!
-Hi.

756
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:51,789
Is he your boyfriend, Sol?

757
00:50:52,498 --> 00:50:53,499
No.

758
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:56,460
Have you been seeing each other
since then?

759
00:50:57,086 --> 00:51:00,589
I had business nearby, and I asked her
to show me around school.

760
00:51:00,673 --> 00:51:03,843
-Let's go!
-Let's go play a couple's game!

761
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:06,303
-A couple's game!
-Couple's game!

762
00:51:06,387 --> 00:51:07,722
All right.

763
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:09,640
-Let's…
-Sol!

764
00:51:09,724 --> 00:51:12,059
Sol! Come play…

765
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,311
Are you…

766
00:51:14,812 --> 00:51:16,564
Are you two a couple?

767
00:51:17,398 --> 00:51:20,109
-You're here to play the couple's game!
-Don't they look good together?

768
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:22,528
-Let me through.
-You have to throw a dart

769
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,947
and play the game it lands on.

770
00:51:25,031 --> 00:51:26,907
That's all you have to do.

771
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:28,200
You try it.

772
00:51:28,284 --> 00:51:29,535
-Me?
-Yes.

773
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:32,038
You should give up.
You're no match to him.

774
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:35,374
Okay, let's go.

775
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,376
Se-hun, spin the wheel.

776
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:40,004
All right, I'll spin the wheel.

777
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:43,049
Spin the wheel!

778
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:47,595
Oh, it's "Pop the Balloon"!
The most exciting game.

779
00:51:47,678 --> 00:51:49,430
-What is it?
-You two, come over here.

780
00:51:49,513 --> 00:51:53,059
I can't believe Sol's hanging out with
a guy. He's really handsome, isn't he?

781
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:54,727
I'll put a balloon right here.

782
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,730
-What?
-Stick together like this.

783
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,273
And pop it with your bodies.

784
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:01,317
You succeed if you pop it in five seconds.

785
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,152
All right, let's begin.

786
00:52:03,235 --> 00:52:05,905
Ready, go.

787
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:10,534
You did it! Congratulations!

788
00:52:10,618 --> 00:52:12,203
Take your prize.

789
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:14,038
-There's a prize?
-Take your pick.

790
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:15,414
Did Sol tell you anything?

791
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:18,834
No, she didn't.
She said they're not dating.

792
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,544
It doesn't seem like that.

793
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:23,964
I can totally tell from the guy's face.

794
00:52:24,048 --> 00:52:26,675
Why else would he have come here?
There's nothing to see.

795
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:28,969
He just came to take a look around.

796
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:32,264
Sol's so lucky.

797
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:35,101
You know how they say
you'll get really lucky with men

798
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:37,103
after you have no one for a while.

799
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:40,106
It's an undeniable truth, you know.

800
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,191
She said they're not dating.

801
00:52:45,528 --> 00:52:48,114
-Why are you giving me this?
-You like that character.

802
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:50,658
I don't like it anymore.

803
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:53,327
Is there something going on?

804
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,206
We were supposed to hang out together.
Why did you bring a guy along?

805
00:52:57,289 --> 00:52:58,124
Oh…

806
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,584
I…

807
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:03,379
Well…

808
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:08,134
Sorry. I didn't think
it would make you uncomfortable.

809
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:10,845
If I knew, I would've brought a guy too.

810
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:13,055
Did you enjoy playing the couple's game?

811
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:17,643
I need to smoke.

812
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:19,770
-Hey.
-What's with you?

813
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:32,783
Lime?

814
00:53:33,534 --> 00:53:35,077
I think you'll like it.

815
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:38,414
-Me?
-You said so at the club.

816
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:42,751
You remember that?

817
00:53:55,514 --> 00:53:57,433
You must be exhausted.

818
00:53:57,516 --> 00:53:58,726
Good work.

819
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:02,104
But the after-party begins now,
so let's go have fun!

820
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:07,568
You're all going to get wasted today!

821
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:12,323
-Guys, take this.
-Thanks!

822
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,284
-Move!
-Move over!

823
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:36,889
Gosh, my head.

824
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,406
I should go buy medicine.

825
00:55:01,538 --> 00:55:04,625
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

826
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:07,711
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday.

827
00:55:07,795 --> 00:55:09,255
I'm really sorry.

828
00:55:10,673 --> 00:55:12,174
<i>So I was just a replacement?</i>

829
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:14,510
<i>Whatever. I don't care now.</i>

830
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:16,637
<i>But…</i>

831
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,223
She suddenly contacted me yesterday.
I'm really sorry.

832
00:55:24,353 --> 00:55:25,771
<i>So embarrassing…</i>

833
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:43,289
Who is this?

834
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:52,423
Hello?

835
00:55:52,506 --> 00:55:53,590
<i>What are you doing?</i>

836
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:56,468
Park Jae-eon?

837
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:58,137
Wait.

838
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:00,055
Did you delete my number?

839
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:02,141
Well…

840
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:13,277
Why did you call?

841
00:56:14,403 --> 00:56:15,821
What's wrong with your voice?

842
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:18,115
Are you sick?

843
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:20,826
I'm not feeling well.

844
00:56:22,494 --> 00:56:25,080
<i>I'm near your house right now.</i>

845
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:29,710
So?

846
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:35,966
Why would you come here?

847
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:38,594
My friend lives nearby.

848
00:56:38,677 --> 00:56:41,513
<i>Okay. Have fun.</i>

849
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:42,723
Na-bi.

850
00:56:45,392 --> 00:56:46,560
Yes?

851
00:56:47,353 --> 00:56:49,104
Do you want to meet right now?

852
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:53,734
Right now?

853
00:57:20,135 --> 00:57:21,220
So cold.

854
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:27,643
Why don't they have any medicine?

855
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,616
There must've been an accident.

856
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,618
-There's even a police car.
-Is someone hurt?

857
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:46,495
-What's going on?
-Why is there a police car?

858
00:57:47,162 --> 00:57:48,580
Was there an accident?

859
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:49,623
Is it a student?

860
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:53,127
-A student lives there.
-Excuse me.

861
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,461
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

862
00:57:54,545 --> 00:57:56,130
-The third floor?
-Isn't that her?

863
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,717
Hey! Can you hear me?

864
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,719
I think something happened to her! Hurry!

865
00:58:01,802 --> 00:58:03,637
Calm down and stay back.

866
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:05,389
We should open it.

867
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:08,142
-Hurry.
-Wait!

868
00:58:08,225 --> 00:58:10,018
Wait, sir. Wait!

869
00:58:10,561 --> 00:58:13,021
What are you doing? Who called you?

870
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:21,363
I'm sorry.

871
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,282
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. We'll get going.

872
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:37,755
You know you totally overreacted, right?

873
00:58:38,922 --> 00:58:40,299
I was just worried.

874
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:43,927
You said you were sick.
Plus, you live alone.

875
00:58:49,808 --> 00:58:53,353
All right.
Well, you know that I'm alive now.

876
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:55,063
Bye.

877
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:56,899
Are you really okay?

878
00:58:58,609 --> 00:58:59,735
I'm fine.

879
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,697
You have a fever.
Let's go to the hospital.

880
00:59:03,781 --> 00:59:04,823
It's fine.

881
00:59:05,991 --> 00:59:08,660
I'll be fine if I get some sleep.

882
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:13,040
Bye.

883
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,063
Hey.

884
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:39,525
Let's go. Come on.

885
00:59:39,608 --> 00:59:41,193
Everyone left.

886
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:47,533
I'm really leaving.

887
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:50,786
Get a grip.

888
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,163
Don't you know how late it is?

889
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:00,963
What are you doing?

890
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:04,883
Come on, let's--

891
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,386
Shut up.

892
01:00:11,056 --> 01:00:12,808
You kind of…

893
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:14,393
look…

894
01:00:15,727 --> 01:00:17,145
handsome up close.

895
01:00:58,353 --> 01:00:59,730
<i>Was I too cold?</i>

896
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:02,733
No.

897
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:04,860
I did the right thing.

898
01:01:06,737 --> 01:01:08,155
I should just get some sleep.

899
01:01:14,828 --> 01:01:16,038
Who is it?

900
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:22,336
Can I come in?

901
01:01:24,004 --> 01:01:25,297
Oh, sure.

902
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:34,014
There weren't any pharmacies open,
so I went to a convenience store.

903
01:01:37,351 --> 01:01:39,519
Take some medicine after you eat.

904
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:41,939
Okay. Thanks.

905
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,942
Get some sleep, then. Bye.

906
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:47,861
<i>You really came back because of this?</i>

907
01:01:48,445 --> 01:01:49,488
Hey, Jae-eon.

908
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:53,533
I don't like this.

909
01:01:54,534 --> 01:01:55,494
Take it back.

910
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,460
I'm hungry.

911
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:08,382
You didn't even eat until this hour?

912
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:11,969
I didn't have an appetite
since I smelled food all day.

913
01:02:14,137 --> 01:02:15,222
But I'm hungry now.

914
01:02:22,896 --> 01:02:26,984
Then you can eat this here.

915
01:02:35,409 --> 01:02:36,910
This is really tasty.

916
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:43,208
-I haven't had homemade food in a while.
-My aunt made all this.

917
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,043
The aunt who named you?

918
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:48,005
Yes.

919
01:02:52,718 --> 01:02:53,635
You must be sleepy.

920
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:56,722
Yes. Probably because of the medicine.

921
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:58,640
I'm so sleepy now.

922
01:03:00,434 --> 01:03:02,060
-Go lie down.
-It's fine.

923
01:03:02,853 --> 01:03:04,396
I'll sleep after you leave.

924
01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:07,691
I ate your food,

925
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:11,611
so let me help you.

926
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:13,864
What?

927
01:03:13,947 --> 01:03:16,533
Hey! What are you doing?

928
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:19,828
Hey, let me down.

929
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:22,372
Wait!

930
01:03:49,232 --> 01:03:52,152
"There was a boy in the small store.

931
01:03:52,235 --> 01:03:55,322
He waited for the girl every day."

932
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:58,492
What are you doing?

933
01:03:59,117 --> 01:04:00,243
Go home now.

934
01:04:00,952 --> 01:04:03,497
I'll go home when you fall asleep.
Don't worry.

935
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,917
It's worse to see you gone
when I wake up later.

936
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:10,754
Should I stay, then?

937
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:15,383
I didn't mean that…

938
01:04:17,135 --> 01:04:19,721
<i>Right. I don't want you to leave.</i>

939
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,726
You're really weird.

940
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:27,687
The way you talk, and the things you do…

941
01:04:28,271 --> 01:04:29,689
You even called 911.

942
01:04:32,526 --> 01:04:35,946
You mean you want to think of me
as a jerk,

943
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:38,240
but I actually seem okay, right?

944
01:04:40,075 --> 01:04:41,034
You're so annoying.

945
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:46,248
To tell you the truth,

946
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,584
I was shocked when I saw you with Eun-han.

947
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:53,588
-Why?
-I don't know.

948
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:57,509
Maybe I got jealous.

949
01:04:57,592 --> 01:04:59,386
You deleted my number,

950
01:05:00,387 --> 01:05:01,930
but you seemed happy with him.

951
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:07,727
Then you would've felt good

952
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:10,522
when you saw me get rejected.

953
01:05:17,195 --> 01:05:18,905
Save my number again.

954
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:22,450
I'm not such a bad guy, am I?

955
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:28,456
<i>I don't know if it's because of
the fever or because of him,</i>

956
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,958
<i>but I feel so dizzy.</i>

957
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:35,463
Why are you doing this to me?
Because my name means "butterfly"?

958
01:05:36,047 --> 01:05:39,050
I've been attracted to you
from the beginning.

959
01:05:41,386 --> 01:05:43,555
Oh, I see.

960
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:48,351
You're so funny, you know that?

961
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:50,353
What's so funny?

962
01:05:50,437 --> 01:05:52,689
Why do you ask
if you won't even believe me?

963
01:05:52,772 --> 01:05:55,025
You're not really trustworthy, you know.

964
01:05:55,108 --> 01:05:58,278
Then will you see me in a different light
if I try to earn your trust?

965
01:06:52,165 --> 01:06:55,377
<i>Maybe he really…</i>

966
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:12,894
Your fever's down.

967
01:07:15,355 --> 01:07:18,108
You really nursed me
the old-fashioned way?

968
01:07:18,942 --> 01:07:20,485
Classic methods are the best.

969
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,863
You're right.

970
01:07:28,201 --> 01:07:29,744
I should get ready for school.

971
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:53,018
Why don't you leave your hair down?

972
01:07:55,103 --> 01:07:57,230
-It's uncomfortable.
-Still.

973
01:07:58,106 --> 01:07:59,607
Just for me.

974
01:08:25,008 --> 01:08:26,384
Then…

975
01:08:29,596 --> 01:08:31,598
I want to see your hair tied up.

976
01:09:17,102 --> 01:09:18,353
It's pretty.

977
01:13:06,604 --> 01:13:10,644
NEVERTHELESS,

978
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:30,722

I already got used to them.</i>

<i>Is there someone else you're seeing?</i>

990
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:22,407
Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

991
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,783
We should end it.

992
01:14:23,866 --> 01:14:25,410
<i>I don't want to let go.</i>

993
01:14:25,493 --> 01:14:26,369

994
01:14:27,036 --> 01:14:29,664
