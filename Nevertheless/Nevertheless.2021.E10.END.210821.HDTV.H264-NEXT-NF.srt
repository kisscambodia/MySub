1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:08,067
NEVERTHELESS,

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,087
NEVERTHELESS,

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,953
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,744
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:20,516
Do you regret it?

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,771
Do you regret what we did?

7
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:31,527
Yes.

8
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:34,488
I regret it.

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,537
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

10
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,207
But I won't blame you.

11
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:46,542
I brought it on myself.

12
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,714
I knew there was no happy ending for us,

13
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:56,260
but I was an idiot for getting my hopes up
and thinking you could be sincere.

14
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:02,850
You told me that I had
the right to decide our relationship.

15
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:08,356
I don't want to see you ever again.

16
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,402
<i>To be honest,</i>

17
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:57,196
<i>I already knew</i>

18
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,533
<i>that this wasn't love.</i>

19
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,754
<i>I think I know now.</i>

20
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:59,216
<i>That I'm the one</i>

21
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:02,762
<i>who ruined everything.</i>

22
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,113
<i>I couldn't sleep at all.</i>

23
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,074
<i>I regret it.</i>

24
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:09,203
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

25
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,289
<i>Na-bi's pained expression</i>

26
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:15,418
<i>and her tearful voice</i>

27
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,462
<i>lingered in my head all night.</i>

28
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:56,584
<i>Funnily enough, what kept me up all night</i>

29
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,336
<i>weren't the harsh words he said to me,</i>

30
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,173
<i>but his warm eyes,</i>

31
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,217
<i>his gentle voice when he called me,</i>

32
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,845
<i>and his soft touch.</i>

33
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,015
I'm so pathetic.

34
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,701
-Hey, Na-bi.
-Hey.

35
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,244
No hangover?

36
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:34,121
No.

37
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:38,417
We drank so much after you left.

38
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,628
I never saw Jae-eon drink that much.

39
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:43,672
I almost died trying to keep up with him.

40
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,763
Jin-su…

41
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:56,018
You don't have to help me
with my piece anymore.

42
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,855
I can do the rest myself.

43
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,315
Why? This is so sudden.

44
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,610
Well, it's our exam period now.

45
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,655
And I got most of the work done.

46
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:09,990
Can you tell Jae-eon too?

47
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:13,035
Okay, then.

48
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:15,579
Thanks.

49
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,776
Do you have a lot to do?

50
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:29,695
What?

51
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:30,946
Hey.

52
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,451
Hey!

53
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,202
What? What is it?

54
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,246
Did you see Gyu-hyun and Bit-na?

55
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,665
No, I don't think so.

56
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,959
Jeez. What's going on with them?

57
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:47,713
They were fighting all the time,
and now they're leaving me out.

58
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:52,176
No way. How did she know
I was talking about her?

59
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:55,846
-What?
-Hey!

60
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,349
I heard you're in our department office.
Is that true?

61
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,934
<i>-Yes. How did you know?</i>
-That's such a relief.

62
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:05,147
Do you see a laptop near the shelves?

63
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,440
A laptop?

64
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:08,817
Yes, it's here.

65
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,236
<i>There's a file dated today on the desktop.</i>

66
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,863
<i>Can you send that to me?</i>

67
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:14,740
What will you do for me, then?

68
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:17,493
<i>My gosh. Fine, I'll buy you fried chicken.</i>

69
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:20,037
Okay! Hang on a second.

70
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,502
All right.

71
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,048
Hello?

72
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,217
What's the file…

73
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,719
Hey, it's locked. What's the password?

74
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:36,929
What?

75
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,432
Oh, right. The password…

76
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:44,228
Well…

77
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:47,064
What is it?
Is it the same as your bank account?

78
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,190
I won't steal your money.

79
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:49,817
Just tell me.

80
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,656
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

81
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:57,533
<i>Hang on.</i>

82
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:00,035
<i>What did you say? I can't hear you.</i>

83
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,249
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

84
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:08,293
<i>Jeez. What are you saying?
I can't hear you!</i>

85
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:11,422
Darn it! "Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun"!

86
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,216
What?

87
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,176
What did you just say?

88
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,848
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun"?

89
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,141
What?

90
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,727
You don't mean the Nam Gyu-hyun
I know, do you?

91
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,105
If you don't send it in five minutes,
you're dead.

92
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,732
Thank you so much, buddy.

93
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,322
I understand.

94
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:41,076
-Your cake is ready.
-I want to die.

95
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:43,704
The totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun
will go get it.

96
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:45,831
Hey, don't tease me!

97
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:47,249
-I'll be back.
-Jeez!

98
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,626
Don't make that cheesy voice!
Or I'll kill you!

99
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,672
Jeez! I just want to die.

100
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:53,607
YU NA-BI

101
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,155
And you say you really like me?

102
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:02,074
That's nonsense.

103
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,287
Hey, Na-bi.

104
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:50,247
Hi.

105
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:55,544
You seemed to have lost more weight.
Are you okay?

106
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,671
I didn't get much sleep.

107
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,090
You must be overworking.

108
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,346
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Jae-eon at all these days.

109
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,932
He was acting like
he was working so hard to help you.

110
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:13,854
I said I'd finish my piece by myself.

111
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,398
It's almost over, anyway.

112
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:18,442
Oh, really?

113
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,986
I thought he was…

114
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,280
We'll head inside first.

115
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:24,489
Okay.

116
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:33,957
What's Na-bi going to do?

117
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,626
This is terrible.

118
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:38,920
She won't be able to hand it in
before the exhibition.

119
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:42,841
I can't believe it.
Why did it have to fall right here?

120
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,427
What's going on?

121
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:48,472
How did this fan fall from the ceiling?

122
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,353
Hey, Na-bi!

123
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:17,834
-Why did it…
-Let's go. Stop looking.

124
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:21,213
Go back to your work. Stop staring and go.

125
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,006
Hey…

126
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:49,408
Na-bi…

127
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:55,288
What happened? Why is it…

128
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:03,964
Na-bi!

129
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,008
Na-bi, are you okay?

130
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:14,558
All right.

131
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,893
How can such a thing happen?

132
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:19,146
Someone could have been hurt!

133
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,398
I can't believe it.

134
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,945
Let's get everything repaired properly
so this will never happen again.

135
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,155
-Okay.
-Okay.

136
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,616
How is Na-bi? She must be in shock.

137
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:34,369
Yes, she is…

138
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:37,706
She won't have enough time to fix it.

139
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,167
And it's their exam period now.

140
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,419
I can't tell her to work on it right now…

141
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,588
It's not even her fault.

142
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:48,967
Right. Don't push her
to do anything right now.

143
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,637
If she says she'll give up,
then we have no choice.

144
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:54,533
<i>It feels like I'm having terrible,
recurring nightmares.</i>

145
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,010
<i>HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS</i>

146
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,473
This is the transverse arch?

147
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:19,975
Yes.

148
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:23,395
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

149
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:27,274
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

150
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,109
Correct.

151
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,322
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

152
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:35,740
Stop.

153
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,561
Hello?

154
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:07,439
Oh, Yun Sol.

155
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:10,859
What?

156
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,686
Let's fix this.

157
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:54,337
And when we're done,

158
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,299
I'll stay away from you.

159
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:03,263
I promise.

160
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,520
We can't even blame anyone.

161
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,939
Jin-su, give me the gloves.

162
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,032
Let's clean this up.

163
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:26,285
<i>I don't know how I should feel
about Jae-eon,</i>

164
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,546
<i>but focusing on work together</i>

165
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:40,132
<i>feels natural and comfortable.</i>

166
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,721
<i>It's as if nothing had happened
between us.</i>

167
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,606
Sorry I'm late. But I got these for you.

168
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:45,197
Try this.

169
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,867
Eat up.

170
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,831
-Do you want some too?
-Yes.

171
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:56,334
-Thank you.
-Want a sausage?

172
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,002
-Yes!
-Here.

173
00:21:58,502 --> 00:21:59,587
Hey…

174
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:17,748
<i>Jae-eon is still kind, but…</i>

175
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,816
You have a lot of stuff.

176
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:47,236
Yes. I called a cab.

177
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,530
Right.

178
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,575
<i>He doesn't offer to take me home anymore.</i>

179
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,878
<i>The conflicts we had whenever we met</i>

180
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,422
<i>are gone, too.</i>

181
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,052
How about having some beer?

182
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:15,389
We have to come early tomorrow.
Maybe next time.

183
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:16,557
Come on.

184
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:23,230
I'll get going.

185
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,692
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

186
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:29,778
Get home safe.

187
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:35,576
Jae-eon. I'll leave
after I finish up some work.

188
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:37,244
Okay.

189
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:09,777
-I…
-Is it okay?

190
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:12,530
Yes. I think it's all done.

191
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:16,784
I'll move this.

192
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,707
No, I'll do it. It's heavy.

193
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:34,361
Well…

194
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:42,828
Thank you.

195
00:26:56,175 --> 00:27:00,012
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

196
00:27:03,766 --> 00:27:04,725
And the prettiest.

197
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:09,188
Good luck with the exhibition.

198
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:12,149
And…

199
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,330
I'll get going.

200
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,791
Jae-eon, what are you doing?

201
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,004
What is all this?

202
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,923
My tools.

203
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:21,593
I know, but why are you taking everything?

204
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,098
Do you want them?

205
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,892
What about you?

206
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,436
Oh, are you getting new ones?

207
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:37,860
Never mind, then.

208
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:41,280
I want them! Thanks.

209
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:18,067
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

210
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:21,779
<i>But why…</i>

211
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:25,824
<i>do I not feel happy?</i>

212
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:43,550
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

213
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:45,302
Here.

214
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:50,432
Hey, this is mine. Where did you get it?

215
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,351
Jae-eon asked me to give it to you.

216
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,022
Really? Thanks.

217
00:29:57,773 --> 00:30:00,150
-I'll clean up a bit.
-Okay.

218
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:48,031
<i>I don't think I can stay by her side any
longer in a vague relationship like this.</i>

219
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,113
<i>The semester's finally over!</i>

220
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:14,117
Shall we celebrate?

221
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:15,953
-Yes!
-Nice!

222
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,704
Are you that happy, guys?

223
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:20,874
-What?
-I just feel anxious now.

224
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,210
We have to start preparing
to get jobs now.

225
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:25,963
I'm so scared about my exam results.

226
00:32:27,923 --> 00:32:31,218
Oh, right. This is Jae-eon's.
Is anyone keeping in touch with him?

227
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,761
-Bye!
-Oh…

228
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:35,555
Jin-su, you can't reach him either?

229
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:39,518
No. I guess we weren't close friends.
I thought we grew quite close.

230
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,854
Jae-eon even took all his tools and stuff.

231
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:45,065
He took
all his former projects and everything.

232
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:49,361
<i>After that day,
Jae-eon disappeared without a trace.</i>

233
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,947
Is it a young artist's spirit
or something?

234
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,032
Maybe he sold them.

235
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:56,535
I think he took everything apart
and threw them away.

236
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,954
He did seem strange that day.

237
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,664
Classes weren't even over yet,

238
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:02,749
but he packed up
like he was going somewhere.

239
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:03,750
Right, Na-bi?

240
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,586
Maybe he really went somewhere.

241
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,630
He did talk about going to the States.

242
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:10,632
Good luck with the exhibition.

243
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:13,593
And…

244
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,313
<i>What did he want to tell me?</i>

245
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,897
How can he just leave like that?

246
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:28,483
With his personality,
it's totally possible.

247
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:31,862
I guess nobody knows
that much about Jae-eon.

248
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:36,158
Jae-eon doesn't talk much about himself.

249
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:37,826
But you know something, right?

250
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:39,202
What would I know?

251
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:40,954
You really don't know?

252
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:42,247
-No.
-Didn't you know?

253
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:44,499
She retired from her gossip columnist job.

254
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:45,667
She's busy dating!

255
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,753
Bit-na is dating!

256
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:49,921
Let's go.

257
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:52,799
Hey, we're going to drink near school,

258
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:54,134
so come and join us.

259
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:55,802
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

260
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:57,971
-You should come!
-All right.

261
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:22,162
SHARK

262
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,125
SHARK

263
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:28,794
This one.

264
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:36,927
Why did you laugh?

265
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:41,431
Because you're cute.

266
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:16,758
<i>Didn't you want to see me again?</i>

267
00:35:21,596 --> 00:35:23,140
I was glad…

268
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:25,809
to see you again.

269
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:40,574
You jerk.

270
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:38,965
Excuse me.

271
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:41,343
Aren't you
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

272
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:43,303
Oh, yes. I am.

273
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:46,306
I can't believe it. Hi.

274
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:48,225
I'm a huge fan.

275
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:51,853
I've been watching your videos
since the beginning.

276
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:52,854
Thank you.

277
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:55,815
Could we get an autograph?

278
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:59,486
-An autograph?
-Yes, please.

279
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:09,287
YANG

280
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,632
YANG DO-HYEOK

281
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,844
Thank you. Could we take a photo as well?

282
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,013
A photo?

283
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:28,848
Do it.

284
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:32,477
My friend's here.

285
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,062
Sorry.

286
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:40,652
Hey! Aren't you
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

287
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,280
Can I have an autograph too?

288
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:47,784
Your semester's finally over.

289
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:51,037
Yes. This semester felt like one year.

290
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,332
Are you going to stay in Seoul?

291
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:58,211
No, I'm going to my mom's
after the exhibition is over.

292
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:00,755
She's nagging at me to come.

293
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:03,883
What about your aunt?

294
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:07,804
Do-yeon seems to miss you a lot too.

295
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,769
That was obvious, wasn't it?

296
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:17,772
Yes, that was an excuse.

297
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:21,318
I did tell my aunt that I'd visit soon.

298
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:25,739
I don't think I can stay
with my mom during my whole vacation.

299
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:29,242
The exhibition's until seven, right?

300
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,620
Yes. But can you come?

301
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:34,539
Didn't you say you were filming something?
An interview?

302
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:37,626
It might be a little tight, but…

303
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:40,378
Then it's fine.
Don't strain yourself. Just focus on work.

304
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:43,298
No, I have to make it.

305
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:44,966
It's your exhibition.

306
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:47,969
I'm excited to see it.

307
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:52,349
It's amazing how you fixed your piece.

308
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:55,560
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

309
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:00,857
My assistants helped out a lot.

310
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,910
Anyway, it was pretty tough,

311
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:15,705
but I did gain some things too.

312
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:17,499
Like what?

313
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:23,463
I like working now.

314
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:28,009
To be honest,
I wasn't enjoying it for a while,

315
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:32,764
but someone told me that I look
the happiest when I'm working.

316
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:37,060
I was happy…

317
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:41,272
to hear that.

318
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:47,737
Maybe you actually did
enjoy it the whole time.

319
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:49,906
And you just realized it

320
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,617
when you heard those words.

321
00:39:56,663 --> 00:39:57,580
Maybe.

322
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:06,256
You must be grateful to them.

323
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,676
Right.

324
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:22,439
Let's eat.

325
00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:25,775
-Try it. It's really tasty.
-Okay.

326
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:38,621
Gosh. Everything will be over tomorrow.

327
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,457
Finally.

328
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,917
I thought I'd be happy for it to all end.

329
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,007
But I guess I was wrong.

330
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,304
Is Jae-eon coming tomorrow?

331
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,264
I don't know.

332
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:12,549
<i>How can I define</i>

333
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:15,844
<i>the feelings I have left for Jae-eon?</i>

334
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:20,765
<i>Lingering affection?</i>

335
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,309
<i>Regret?</i>

336
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:25,770
<i>Hate?</i>

337
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,190
<i>Or…</i>

338
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:09,856
<i>Honestly, I didn't want to come.</i>

339
00:43:09,939 --> 00:43:11,441
Why?

340
00:43:11,524 --> 00:43:13,401
It wasn't because of the exhibition.

341
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:17,822
I just have bad memories about this place.

342
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:19,949
Really?

343
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:24,579
I saw someone so beautiful here

344
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:27,332
that I fell in love at first sight.

345
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,251
I'm sure.

346
00:43:31,377 --> 00:43:33,046
It was snowing that day.

347
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:34,213
I didn't ask.

348
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:36,299
It was an opening exhibition
for an artist.

349
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:38,051
What was the artist's name?

350
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:39,928
But why is it called "Nabi"?

351
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:41,346
I don't know.

352
00:43:43,014 --> 00:43:45,099
<i>It was boring, so I was about to leave.</i>

353
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:47,602
<i>But then…</i>

354
00:43:48,436 --> 00:43:51,105
<i>I saw a girl standing
in front of a piece for a long time.</i>

355
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:53,191
<i>Just like you back there.</i>

356
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:07,997
Na-bi.

357
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:29,686
<i>And one day, I ran into her again.</i>

358
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:30,812
<i>I was startled.</i>

359
00:44:31,312 --> 00:44:33,523
<i>If I believed in fate,</i>

360
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:35,858
<i>I would have felt that this was it.</i>

361
00:44:54,585 --> 00:44:57,797
PARK JAE-EON

362
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:04,429
<i>The person you are trying to reach

363
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:36,569
Oh, my gosh.
"Hello. Hi. It's nice to meet you."

364
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,369
-Jo Min-yeong!
-What?

365
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:45,912
Your phone!

366
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:49,249
Oh, my gosh! I almost got in huge trouble.

367
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,877
Stay calm during the interview.
And here, take this.

368
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,170
What is it?

369
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:57,298
Sugar. You get low on sugar
when you're anxious.

370
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,345
YOU CAN DO IT, MIN-YEONG!

371
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:05,682
Sorry I can't help with the exhibition.

372
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:08,268
It'll go fine without you, so don't worry.

373
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:09,394
Focus on the interview.

374
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:11,187
Okay? Come on, you should go.

375
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,439
Right. See you later!

376
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:18,570
You can do it!

377
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,238
I can do it!

378
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:07,637
Don't think of going home tonight.

379
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,139
-Hey, Bit-na!
-Hey!

380
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,100
-Hi!
-Oh, no. I didn't buy flowers.

381
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,478
-Ji-wan bought them for me.
-I sure did.

382
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:17,522
Are you excited?

383
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:20,149
Hey, Yun Sol's piece is the best!

384
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:23,194
We haven't even entered the gallery yet.

385
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:24,779
I can just tell.

386
00:48:24,862 --> 00:48:27,490
-She's praising you all the time.
-Hey, be quiet.

387
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:32,161
Here, ten each. Hand these out.

388
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,079
Here.

389
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:36,040
Hey, can you hand these out?

390
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:38,126
-Mr. An, can you take a photo of us?
-What?

391
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:40,920
-Come on. Hurry.
-Hold onto this for me.

392
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,296
-Hurry.
-All right.

393
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,507
-Make me look tall.
-Okay.

394
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,260
Make a pose. All right. One, two, three.

395
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:48,386
-Mr. An!
-Mr. An!

396
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:50,346
-One more.
-Hang on.

397
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,724
-Gosh, look at you!
-That's enough for you guys.

398
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:54,100
-All right.
-You look good.

399
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:56,227
Can you take one for us too?

400
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,354
You look like a different person today.

401
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,689
You look really nice today.

402
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,901
One, two, three.

403
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:05,570
Once more.

404
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,613
-I'll do a close-up.
-Focus on Sol.

405
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:09,532
Sol? One, two, three.

406
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,117
YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

407
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,202
-Hey!
-Hey, guys!

408
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:16,080
Why did no one bring flowers?

409
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:17,790
Hey, you look so pretty!

410
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:19,959
-I should've brought some.
-I'm a flower.

411
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:23,296
-I'm a flower.
-Why would we need flowers? I'm a flower.

412
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:25,048
-Jin-su, it's your debut!
-You're so late.

413
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:28,217
Right,
I worked on Na-bi's piece with Jae-eon.

414
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:29,969
-Be quiet, you guys.
-They're pretty.

415
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,512
-Mr. An!
-Gosh, you're handsome.

416
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:33,639
Be quiet, guys. Go inside.

417
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:35,516
Come on. Get inside.

418
00:49:38,227 --> 00:49:39,395
This place is cool.

419
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,607
Hey, look over there.

420
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,317
This is…

421
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,985
Hey, Sol.

422
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:54,535
Congratulations.

423
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:56,412
Good work.

424
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:02,668
It feels different looking at them
exhibited like this.

425
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,212
It's so cool.

426
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:06,464
Sol really is talented. You're awesome.

427
00:50:06,547 --> 00:50:08,591
Sol, what was the name of this?

428
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,260
-"Union."
-"Onion"?

429
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,637
-"Union."
-Stop making jokes.

430
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,348
Sol, you really are the best.

431
00:50:15,848 --> 00:50:18,017
Sol, you're awesome.

432
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,823
What's that?

433
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:35,993
Na-bi's piece is really amazing.

434
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,120
Right?

435
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:39,038
Maybe the accident actually helped her.

436
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:41,207
No, Na-bi wouldn't be happy to hear that.

437
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:46,295
Na-bi could really go to Paris
at this rate.

438
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:48,965
-No way.
-This is incredible.

439
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:50,967
Where's Na-bi?

440
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,052
Right. Where is she?

441
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,804
There she is. Hang on.

442
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:10,069
What are you doing?

443
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:15,074
I was a bit tired,
so I was getting some rest.

444
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:17,743
Na-bi. The professor's calling for you.

445
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:18,870
Okay.

446
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:24,584
It must be exhausting.

447
00:51:26,794 --> 00:51:27,920
Professor.

448
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:34,886
It must've been tough
fixing your piece in such a short time.

449
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:37,138
But it was worth it, wasn't it?

450
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,266
Yes. I enjoyed it.

451
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,148
I could feel that emotion in your piece.

452
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:48,191
Good work.

453
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:52,236
Thank you.

454
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,656
Na-bi. You should go to Paris.

455
00:51:57,116 --> 00:52:00,203
Yes. I want to go there.

456
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:03,789
Great. That's the spirit.

457
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:05,750
It seems like you've spread your wings.

458
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:08,878
There's no need to overthink it.

459
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:11,547
Eat what you want,
and do what you want to do.

460
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:12,882
Like the people you like.

461
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:15,259
That's all you have to do.

462
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:18,471
All right.

463
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:21,307
SCULPTURE: YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

464
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,894
You're taking everything down today?

465
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:26,395
No, tomorrow.

466
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:28,314
It's too bad.

467
00:52:30,066 --> 00:52:32,318
Why do you look so down, Na-bi?

468
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:33,694
You even got praised.

469
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,406
No, I'm fine.

470
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:41,160
Come to think of it,
did Jae-eon come today?

471
00:52:43,204 --> 00:52:44,747
Jae-eon? Did he not come today?

472
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,957
Did he come?

473
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,459
-Hello.
-Hello.

474
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:51,003
Sorry I'm late.
It took longer than I thought.

475
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:53,422
It's fine. You're not late.
Thanks for coming.

476
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:55,007
Thanks for inviting me.

477
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:04,642
-I'll show you my piece.
-Okay.

478
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:07,103
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

479
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:22,618
What do you think?

480
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:26,247
Gosh. It's just as I expected.

481
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,331
It's great.

482
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:29,375
I'm glad you think so.

483
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:31,502
You're so cool, Na-bi.

484
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:33,462
Stop it.

485
00:53:33,963 --> 00:53:35,673
Na-bi, let's go eat.

486
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:38,342
Oh, it's been a long time!

487
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:39,969
-Awesome.
-You're famous, you know.

488
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:42,013
You're a superstar now.

489
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:45,099
How much do you earn each month
with your channel?

490
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,476
-I'm just curious.
-Can I be in one of your videos?

491
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,687
-Me too.
-Why would you?

492
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,022
That's ridiculous.

493
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:52,690
Did you see that piece?

494
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:56,819
-Hang on. Excuse me.
-Why?

495
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:58,821
Can I join you next time?

496
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:33,272
You like Jae-eon,

497
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:36,525
right?

498
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,237
I think so.

499
00:54:45,326 --> 00:54:46,744
But you were right.

500
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:52,083
I know that he's not someone
who will make me happy.

501
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:02,718
I know it's ridiculous
saying this right now,

502
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:07,223
but I was really happy
spending time with you, Do-hyeok.

503
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:09,892
Thank you.

504
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,854
And I'm sorry.

505
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:16,232
Na-bi.

506
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:25,491
I'm glad I was able to feel these emotions
thanks to you.

507
00:55:26,992 --> 00:55:29,412
I'm grateful, so don't feel sorry.

508
00:55:41,674 --> 00:55:43,676
And please accept this.

509
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:56,188
I'll get going.

510
00:56:09,493 --> 00:56:12,496
Min-yeong. Sorry I'm late.

511
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,918
Your feet are all swollen.

512
00:56:18,002 --> 00:56:19,670
Here. Wear these.

513
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,009
What?

514
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:27,761
It's nothing.

515
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:30,306
I'll do it.

516
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:35,436
What? What is it?

517
00:56:38,022 --> 00:56:39,315
Did the interview go badly?

518
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:41,484
I'm just…

519
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,863
glad that you're here with me right now.

520
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:59,877
Can I keep staying at your house?

521
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:04,548
Sure.

522
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:13,557
I feel so much better.

523
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:16,143
My feet were aching all day.

524
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:17,394
I bet.

525
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:20,898
I'm hungry. Do you want to eat <i>tteokbokki</i>?

526
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:22,024
Sure.

527
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:23,943
Should we have some beer too?

528
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:25,069
Why not?

529
00:57:26,862 --> 00:57:28,197
How was the interview?

530
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:30,574
I don't know…

531
00:57:30,658 --> 00:57:32,910
I was so nervous that
I just blabbered nonsense.

532
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:34,286
I can't even remember much.

533
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:38,290
That's how people always feel
when they do interviews.

534
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:39,458
Just forget about it.

535
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:40,960
<i>Hey.</i>

536
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:44,505
Which one of you liked the other first?

537
00:57:44,588 --> 00:57:46,465
Hey, Gyu-hyun! Was it you?

538
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,385
Hey. The one who had feelings first

539
00:57:49,468 --> 00:57:52,429
and the one who confessed first,
none of that is important.

540
00:57:52,513 --> 00:57:55,391
If they like each other
and they're dating, then it's all fine.

541
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:56,976
-That's right.
-Hey, listen.

542
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:01,397
It's all about who likes the other more,
especially at the beginning.

543
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,358
Se-hun, this is exactly why
you're not dating anyone.

544
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:06,235
-Hey!
-Se-hun! You're so clueless.

545
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:08,612
If you say that, then they can't answer.

546
00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:11,156
They'd be saying they like the other more.

547
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,575
What's the problem?

548
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:15,494
Shouldn't you like the other person more?

549
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:17,872
Why would you date them
if you're not certain?

550
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,374
That's a waste of time.

551
00:58:23,627 --> 00:58:24,962
Sol…

552
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,464
Hey!

553
00:58:28,132 --> 00:58:31,051
So which one of you liked the other first?

554
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:34,430
Well…

555
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:36,599
I liked her first.

556
00:58:36,682 --> 00:58:37,683
What?

557
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:42,062
Really? I thought it'd be Bit-na for sure.

558
00:58:42,146 --> 00:58:42,980
What?

559
00:58:43,564 --> 00:58:44,398
Since when?

560
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:48,777
Since our workshop in our first year.

561
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:51,864
No way.

562
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:52,990
I can't believe it.

563
00:58:53,073 --> 00:58:55,284
Then it's been a really long time.

564
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:59,538
Hang on.
You've been fooling us the whole time?

565
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:01,624
You were just so clueless.

566
00:59:01,707 --> 00:59:03,876
Right, he's a bit clueless.

567
00:59:04,376 --> 00:59:07,630
If that's when you started liking me,

568
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:09,465
then I liked you first.

569
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,886
At our freshman orientation,

570
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:16,221
I saw this hot guy from far away.

571
00:59:16,305 --> 00:59:18,140
As soon as I saw him,

572
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:20,601
I knew I had to make him my boyfriend.

573
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:22,937
Bit-na, stop lying.

574
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,605
-Was it obvious?
-Yes.

575
00:59:25,147 --> 00:59:26,899
I was just kidding!

576
00:59:26,982 --> 00:59:29,735
Hey, Gyu-hyun.
Sorry, but can I have some of that?

577
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:31,278
-I love you.
-I love you.

578
00:59:31,362 --> 00:59:32,196
Go ahead.

579
00:59:34,406 --> 00:59:36,075
I'd bring you the moon if you asked.

580
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:04,520
I miss him.

581
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:59,408
<i>I said I don't believe</i>

582
01:01:00,826 --> 01:01:03,579
<i>in fate or love anymore,</i>

583
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:07,166
<i>but this…</i>

584
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,670
<i>is too unrealistic.</i>

585
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:18,362
What are you doing here?

586
01:02:21,448 --> 01:02:23,826
-Sorry.
-"Sorry"?

587
01:02:26,453 --> 01:02:29,206
-You're the worst. You know that?
-Na-bi.

588
01:02:29,289 --> 01:02:30,707
If you decided to be a jerk,

589
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:33,210
you should've stayed that way.
Why are you here like this?

590
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:34,795
What do you want from me?

591
01:02:53,522 --> 01:02:55,149
Do I still…

592
01:02:57,693 --> 01:02:59,111
have a chance with you?

593
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:00,988
Were you going to cut ties with me then?

594
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:06,535
I couldn't bear the fact
that you hated me so much.

595
01:03:06,618 --> 01:03:08,954
That's right. I hate you.

596
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:13,917
I really hate you,

597
01:03:14,001 --> 01:03:17,337
and I know that you're a jerk
who toys with people's feelings.

598
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:27,973
But I feel better now that I see you.

599
01:03:42,863 --> 01:03:45,032
So don't go anywhere and stay by my side.

600
01:03:53,165 --> 01:03:54,625
Why are you smiling?

601
01:03:56,168 --> 01:03:57,211
It's just that

602
01:03:57,711 --> 01:04:02,007
thinking about what to say to you
makes me smile.

603
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,009
Do you like me that much?

604
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:07,930
Yes. I like you a lot.

605
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:12,309
Park Jae-eon.

606
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:14,269
Let's go out.

607
01:04:17,231 --> 01:04:18,315
You won't regret it?

608
01:04:18,398 --> 01:04:21,735
Of course I will. It's obvious.

609
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:26,740
But I'll still do it.

610
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:49,596
<i>Love.</i>

611
01:04:52,057 --> 01:04:54,309
Why are you so hot, though? Are you sick?

612
01:04:54,393 --> 01:04:55,811
I'm fine.

613
01:04:56,395 --> 01:04:59,481
I don't feel sick at all
since you're here with me.

614
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:02,442
<i>I know that it will cause me pain again.</i>

615
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:04,778
<i>Nevertheless, I still…</i>

616
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:36,601
EPISODE 10: NEVERTHELESS, I STILL…

617
01:05:40,147 --> 01:05:42,024
Do you have a girlfriend?

618
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:44,026
-Can I have your number?
-Me too!

619
01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:45,235
My number?

620
01:05:50,032 --> 01:05:51,158
I have plans.

621
01:05:57,831 --> 01:05:59,291
-Did you get them?
-Yes.

622
01:06:03,337 --> 01:06:04,880
Should we eat something nice?

623
01:06:04,963 --> 01:06:06,006
Okay.

624
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:07,799
What do you want?

625
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,053
Well… What should we have?

626
01:06:11,636 --> 01:06:12,971
I'm not sure…

627
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:24,566
-What is it?
-What?

628
01:06:26,777 --> 01:06:28,570
It's nothing. Let's go.

629
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,332
Then…

630
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,251
should we go to the pasta place
you mentioned?

631
01:06:43,794 --> 01:06:44,628
Okay.

632
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:47,381
Bit-na said it's good.

633
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:48,507
All right.

634
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:50,717
It's a cat.

635
01:06:52,928 --> 01:06:54,429
It's cute.

636
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:57,682
I want a cat. Should we raise one?

637
01:06:57,766 --> 01:07:00,227
No. No more pets for you.

638
01:07:01,561 --> 01:07:02,646
Not even butterflies?

639
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:03,563
<i>No.</i>

640
01:07:03,643 --> 01:07:05,355
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING <i>NEVERTHELESS,</i>

641
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:09,816
NEVERTHELESS,
