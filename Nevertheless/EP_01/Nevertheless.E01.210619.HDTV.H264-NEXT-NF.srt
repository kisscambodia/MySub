00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:07,987
NEVERTHELESS,

00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:13,922
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,797
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,494
<i>Sometimes, the reality you're facing
seems unrealistic.</i>

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,708
<i>Like right now,</i>

6
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,753
<i>as I'm walking the streets
covered in white</i>

7
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:36,963
<i>after an unexpected snow.</i>

8
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:47,057
<i>METAPHORS OF DAWN</i>
YU HYEON-U EXHIBITION

9
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:02,822
<i>It's the same when you're in love.</i>

10
00:01:06,952 --> 00:01:09,871
<i>It feels like you've become
the most special person in the world.</i>

11
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,165
<i>It feels unrealistic.</i>

12
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,387
<i>Your heart…</i>

13
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:27,514
<i>flutters.</i>

14
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,703
It's so erotic.

15
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:51,121
I know.

16
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,309
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF A LOVER
VIEW FROM BEHIND

17
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:14,227
<i>NABI</i>
YU HYEON-U

18
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,687
But why is it called "Nabi"?

19
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,480
I don't know.

20
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:19,024
Let's go.

21
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,609
-What should we see next?
-Let's check this out.

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,944
This one?

23
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:24,863
-Have you heard of him?
-Of course.

24
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,031
Na-bi.

25
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,050
Isn't it pretty?

26
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:07,864
Na-bi.

27
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,532
Yu Na-bi!

28
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,035
<i>What is love?</i>

29
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:19,501
<i>He was a serious person.</i>

30
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:20,585
What is love?

31
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,047
Constantly giving meaning…

32
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:28,009
to something abstract and unfamiliar.

33
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,761
Wouldn't that be true love?

34
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,899
-I knew it.
-What?

35
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,526
I asked to have pizza today

36
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,779
because I wanted to get a glimpse
of your feelings

37
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,614
through the act of sharing food.

38
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,325
-My feelings?
-Yes.

39
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,577
Your feelings for me.

40
00:03:57,288 --> 00:04:00,458
Whether or not this one layer comes
between us tonight

41
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,086
will confirm
the sincerity of our relationship.

42
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:06,631
<i>Almost always…</i>

43
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:08,591
<i>No.</i>

44
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,969
<i>He was always…</i>

45
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:14,597
Honestly, this is ridiculous.

46
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,974
What do you mean?

47
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,770
I wish you wouldn't make
such arbitrary decisions.

48
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,690
Do my nails look that strange?

49
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:25,233
Everyone said they were pretty.

50
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:31,072
"Everyone"? If I were you,
I would've asked for my opinion first.

51
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:32,782
I guess I'm nothing

52
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,034
but a mere stranger to you.

53
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:37,829
Am I the only one who's serious?

54
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:41,416
<i>He obsessively put meaning into everything
and made endless metaphors.</i>

55
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,670
Was my work embarrassing to you?

56
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,131
Is that why you're crying?

57
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,301
Na-bi. Don't just look at the exterior.

58
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,636
You have to look at the meaning
hidden inside it.

59
00:04:56,014 --> 00:05:00,351
You could've asked me about it first.

60
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,313
Darn it!

61
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:05,940
You're making me really upset.

62
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,359
I thought you would understand me
the best.

63
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,991
<i>I once believed that it was special.</i>

64
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,119
I'm not sure if I'd like that!

65
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:19,078
It's a bit strange.

66
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:21,080
He said it's because he loves you.

67
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:23,708
Artists don't use just any model,
you know.

68
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,002
I think

69
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,338
he must really care about you.

70
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,964
You're like his muse.

71
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:32,675
-No, this is really weird.
-His muse?

72
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,843
This is art.

73
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:34,969
You call this art?

74
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:36,346
It looks fine.

75
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:45,563
<i>I was confused…</i>

76
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,107
<i>about boundaries.</i>

77
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,988
Excuse me.

78
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:01,496
Your boyfriend's name
is Yu Hyeon-u, right?

79
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,415
Yes. Why?

80
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,418
I'm not sure if I should tell you, but…

81
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,880
My friend attends that academy.

82
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,640
<i>It's already been a while.</i>

83
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,653
<i>I realized the truth…</i>

84
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:37,365
<i>at an unexpected moment.</i>

85
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:57,719
<i>And to be honest,
I felt like I already knew it.</i>

86
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:09,814
<i>But…</i>

87
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:13,985
Na-bi.

88
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,035
I'm swamped with the academy
and the exhibition.

89
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,829
If the exhibition's successful,
I'll quit being a teacher

90
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,539
and focus on my art career.

91
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:29,709
But I'm not sure what theme I should do.

92
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:34,005
Mr. Baek wants to express people
in their 20s as lively and free…

93
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:36,924
<i>But this jerk talked too much
for me to just blame myself.</i>

94
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:46,059
Na-bi.

95
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:49,771
Why are you sitting like that?
I'm talking about something serious.

96
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,151
You asshole.

97
00:07:58,738 --> 00:07:59,614
What?

98
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:04,285
<i>Love.</i>

99
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,622
<i>It gets trampled on</i>

100
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,124
<i>and helplessly melts away.</i>

101
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,335
<i>It's nothing.</i>

102
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:16,673
<i>My relationship ended like that too.</i>

103
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:27,600
-Na-bi, where are you going?
-The studio.

104
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:28,685
Okay, see you later.

105
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:30,019
See you.

106
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,939
-What are you doing?
-Just chilling.

107
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:33,981
Hurry back.

108
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:46,160
Aren't you going to the studio?

109
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:47,704
-Go ahead first.
-Go ahead first.

110
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:13,855
-Hi.
-Hey.

111
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:23,614
Hi.

112
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:24,907
Hi.

113
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:27,535
Hi, Na-bi.

114
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,460
Where were you, Na-bi?

115
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:36,919
Just outside.

116
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,629
Na-bi, help me.

117
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,089
You should do it yourself.

118
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:42,300
Na-bi, can't you concentrate
for a few hours?

119
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,313
Jeez, what a jerk.

120
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:57,815
What is it this time?

121
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,985
He's the one who suggested
going to a hotel instead of a motel.

122
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,612
And now he wants me to chip in.

123
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,781
Who? The guy you met
through the app yesterday?

124
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:05,740
Yes!

125
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,784
I wouldn't feel this upset if he was good.

126
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,495
It wasn't even worth spending
a night with him!

127
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:13,289
-Why'd you sleep with him, then?
-He must've been handsome.

128
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,749
She loves handsome guys.

129
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,668
This is so annoying. Let's go for a smoke.

130
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:21,881
No, I'm quitting for a while.
I'm not going to smoke for three days.

131
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,716
What's in three days?

132
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,134
A blind date.

133
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:28,179
I'll quit until then,
and if it's bearable, I'll keep it up.

134
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,765
-Another blind date?
-You're unbelievable.

135
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,475
Do you like men that much?

136
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:34,060
You're one to ask.

137
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:35,269
Point taken.

138
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:36,521
It's too noisy here.

139
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,148
-You're going to work, right?
-Yes.

140
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,528
-You're really not going?
-Bye.

141
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,364
Then who can I smoke with?

142
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:48,783
What if I get kidnapped
while smoking alone?

143
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:51,285
-I wonder if my mother would cry for--
-I'll come with you.

144
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:53,371
You're the best.

145
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,706
I just got here.

146
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:00,920
-All right, I'm coming.
-Just a little more.

147
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,256
Do you climb up all these stairs
every time you smoke?

148
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,550
-I don't mind if it's for a drag.
-Gosh.

149
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:09,095
If he's okay, swipe right.
If not, swipe left.

150
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:12,390
And if you both swipe right
for each other, it's a match.

151
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:14,433
And then?

152
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,644
Then you message back and forth here.

153
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,522
If it goes well, you exchange numbers
and maybe meet up later.

154
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:21,983
I guess today is not the day.

155
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,527
But nobody uses
their real names here, right?

156
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,904
Right. I don't show my face
on my profile, either.

157
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:30,575
But some people just reveal
their names and faces.

158
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,326
Oh, I hate tattoos like this!

159
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,494
Tattoos?

160
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:38,249
The guy I met yesterday
had a huge tattoo, too.

161
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:39,500
You know what it said?

162
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:43,380
"I will never die."

163
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:46,090
His thing kept dying,
and he says "never die"?

164
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,842
-How--
-Keep it down.

165
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:49,260
It was so ridiculous.

166
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,095
Some tattoos are pretty, though.

167
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:54,849
Like whose?

168
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,183
What?

169
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,353
Are you seeing someone?

170
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,441
What are you on about?

171
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,443
As if I would.

172
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,576
Do you want to join us for drinks later?

173
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:16,162
No, I'm fine.
I'm going to work late today.

174
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,288
Again?

175
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,833
-Life must be so boring for you.
-Whatever.

176
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,089
Look. He's one of our juniors.

177
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,634
He said he wants to drink with you.

178
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,010
When will I finish?

179
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:34,347
I stayed up all night.
I'm going to have to stay up again.

180
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,642
I just got out of a relationship,
remember?

181
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,060
Hey, I didn't mean that.

182
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:40,978
We all know each other except for you.

183
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:43,022
So I just wanted to introduce you two.

184
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:46,442
Well, anyway…

185
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:47,985
God, you're so boring.

186
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,739
Oh, no! I accidentally swiped left

187
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,325
-on a total hottie!
-Let me see.

188
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,410
I can never see him again.

189
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,500
You're acting unlike yourself today.

190
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,336
What? What is it this time?

191
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,881
Oh, well. You got rid of that jerk,
so you should move on.

192
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,426
-But this app isn't for you.
-Why not?

193
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,887
You're pretty
but you have no taste in men.

194
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,806
-You'll only attract losers.
-Hey!

195
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:17,932
What?

196
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:21,018
Well…

197
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:24,647
Maybe.

198
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:29,402
-You're really not coming?
-No.

199
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:30,653
Have fun.

200
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:33,406
You're so boring.

201
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:35,366
Call me later!

202
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,409
Okay.

203
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,143
EPISODE 1: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FATE.
NEVERTHELESS,

204
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,029
THE DAY SHE BROKE UP WITH X

205
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,139
You got here first.

206
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:54,487
Who are you?

207
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,448
Aren't you So-ri?

208
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:03,162
No, my name is Yu Na-bi.

209
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:05,122
Na-bi?

210
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,714
I guess I mistook you for someone else.
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:15,466
It's fine.

212
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,011
<i>It's silly, but the moment our eyes met…</i>

213
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,034
<i>The pain of the breakup</i>

214
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:45,204
<i>that had been weighing down on me
just a minute ago…</i>

215
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,251
Can I sit here?

216
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,213
You're already sitting there.

217
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,469
Are you with someone?

218
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:04,473
No, I'm not.

219
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,642
<i>…melted away like snow.</i>

220
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,647
But aren't you here to meet someone?

221
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,817
You said you mistook me for someone else.

222
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:16,777
I canceled on her.

223
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,779
Why?

224
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:21,407
I just thought…

225
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:27,538
I didn't need to meet her.

226
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,259
The loser grants the winner a wish.

227
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:41,385
Remember?

228
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,554
I've been conned.

229
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,639
Keep going.

230
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,767
So you broke up today?

231
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:49,727
Oh.

232
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:52,146
Yes.

233
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,273
I flat out dumped him.

234
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,276
I guess he was a bad guy.

235
00:16:57,943 --> 00:16:58,861
Well…

236
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,238
he was a total joke.

237
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,490
I was an idiot for dating him.

238
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,702
Good riddance. Now nothing holds me back
from leaving the country.

239
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,746
-For travel?
-Exchange student.

240
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:11,999
I want to go to Paris.

241
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:13,959
That's cool.

242
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:17,504
But it won't happen anytime soon.
Do you like traveling?

243
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,298
I've never traveled properly before.

244
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:21,675
-I want to go at the end of the year.
-With who?

245
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,556
Alone?

246
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,893
With a friend? Or…

247
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,728
your girlfriend?

248
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:35,898
I'm not sure.

249
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:37,983
With anyone.

250
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,825
Here you go.

251
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:48,744
It's my turn now, right?

252
00:17:58,254 --> 00:17:59,588
Why is it so hard?

253
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,132
Because you haven't done it often.

254
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,928
If you keep practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

255
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:10,057
It doesn't matter where it hits.

256
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:15,854
Just try to get it near the red dot.

257
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:18,816
Easy.

258
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,660
That's unexpected.

259
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,414
What do you mean?

260
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,710
You look a bit different when you smile.

261
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,133
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:46,844
Move over.

263
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:55,185
I won.

264
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,521
Of course you did.

265
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:01,025
You seem happy for a loser.

266
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,484
Well…

267
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,320
it was fun.

268
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:06,196
Right.

269
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:08,407
It's fun to be with you, Na-bi.

270
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,494
<i>This guy…</i>

271
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,040
<i>is bad for my heart.</i>

272
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,583
Okay.

273
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:20,836
Easy.

274
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:21,962
Easy.

275
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:30,804
YU JEONG-RAN

276
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:35,934
Yes, Mom.

277
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:39,396
<i>Na-bi.
Your aunt made your favorite side dish.</i>

278
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,690
-<i>Should I ask her to send it to you?</i>
-No…

279
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:44,068
I still have a lot left over
from last time.

280
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,696
<i>Just throw away the leftovers
and eat the new ones she sends.</i>

281
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,157
You always tell me to throw away stuff.

282
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,158
I'm hanging up now.

283
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,160
<i>Why are you in such a mood?</i>

284
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:55,913
<i>I want my precious daughter
to have new and good stuff.</i>

285
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,247
Anyway, it's fine.

286
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,334
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

287
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:05,172
<i>It's only an hour away by subway
but you never come home.</i>

288
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:07,925
Because he's there…

289
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:14,139
I just have a lot of assignments
these days.

290
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:15,849
How is Ttoli?

291
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,978
<i>Ttoli is always whimpering
because she misses you.</i>

292
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:23,273
<i>Bring your boyfriend.
I'll treat you to delicious food.</i>

293
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:24,441
There's no boyfriend.

294
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,778
<i>What? Did you break up?</i>

295
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,407
<i>Na-bi.</i>

296
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,621
Mom, I need to hang up.

297
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:56,849
What?

298
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,963
Why were you named after a butterfly?

299
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:33,594
So my life could be sweet like honey.
My mom and aunt named me.

300
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:38,724
I'm just kidding.

301
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,395
Do you know Nathaniel Hawthorne?

302
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,773
He's my aunt's favorite author,

303
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,276
and he said this.

304
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,778
It's a bit cringey to quote it.

305
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,700
"Happiness is like a butterfly which,

306
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:01,163
when pursued, is always beyond our grasp,

307
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:05,459
but, if you will sit down quietly,
may alight upon you."

308
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,049
That's the back story.

309
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:15,969
It's nothing special.

310
00:22:16,053 --> 00:22:16,887
No…

311
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,139
I love it.

312
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:40,327
Is that a butterfly…

313
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:42,412
on your neck?

314
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:43,497
Yes.

315
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,834
I like…

316
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:51,630
butterflies.

317
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,726
All done.

318
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:12,985
It's cute.

319
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:16,822
Is this really your wish?

320
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,866
That was pretty simple.

321
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:23,829
Then should I…

322
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,374
make another wish?

323
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:45,642
This is silly.

324
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:47,561
What do you mean?

325
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:50,105
It's nothing.

326
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:07,539
The moon is pretty today.

327
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:17,591
Do you want one?

328
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:21,845
It's my last one.

329
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:23,680
Well…

330
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,557
I don't smoke.

331
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:29,811
Excuse me.

332
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:31,438
Can I borrow a cigarette?

333
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,192
Gosh.

334
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,319
I'm sobering up.

335
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:41,531
Hey, can I borrow a cigarette?

336
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:47,079
If we run into each other next time,
I promise to return the favor.

337
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:50,874
I do have one, but…

338
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:08,767
What the hell?

339
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:31,832
What?

340
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,626
Why are you smiling?

341
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:54,020
Are you okay?

342
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:58,358
Yes.

343
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,193
I'm fine.

344
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:23,383
Do you want to go see butterflies?

345
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:26,470
Where would we see them?

346
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:29,723
At my place.

347
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,275
Let me go to the bathroom for a minute.

348
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:52,787
What are you doing?

349
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:55,916
I miss you too.

350
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,627
Are you going to sleep?

351
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:04,299
Yes.

352
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,596
<i>What? So you just left?</i>

353
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,932
Did you contact him after that?

354
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,266
Of course not.

355
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:17,062
I told him about where my name came from,
but I don't even know his name.

356
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:19,481
You mustered up your courage, though.
Too bad.

357
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,693
What's that?

358
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,696
Oh, this?

359
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,864
Well…

360
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,741
It's nothing.

361
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:30,951
It's love.

362
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,496
It's nothing like that.

363
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,164
-Then what is it?
-Lust?

364
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:38,041
I don't know. It's just…

365
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:40,627
It was fun.

366
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,340
It's hard to find someone
you feel an instant connection with.

367
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:47,592
Never mind that.
You said he has a girlfriend.

368
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:50,887
You should never hang out with cheaters.

369
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:55,725
Oh, right.
I have to post the part-time job ad.

370
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,519
Or should I ask some of the kids?

371
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:58,812
All right.

372
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:01,147
How about Jae-eon?

373
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,483
I'm not sure. Would he do it?

374
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:06,736
I'll try to convince him.

375
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:11,408
Hello.

376
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,535
Oh, do, re, mi, fa, sol. Sol is here.

377
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,205
I have a meeting with the professor.

378
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,332
Right. Go inside with Na-bi.

379
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,714
-Together?
-Together?

380
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:28,758
It's okay. Sol can have the meeting first.

381
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,510
It'll be a waste of time.

382
00:28:30,594 --> 00:28:32,345
It's about
the exchange student program, right?

383
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:36,516
The professor's nagging will get longer
if it's one-on-one.

384
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,642
Right.

385
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,644
Right.

386
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:41,479
Bye, then.

387
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:42,522
Bye.

388
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,193
You're really clueless, aren't you?

389
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:48,904
What do you mean?

390
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:52,866
Na-bi was feeling uncomfortable since
she didn't want to be compared to Sol.

391
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,284
Is that so?

392
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:57,454
You only picked hard places to get in.

393
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,833
Na-bi, it'll be difficult to get
accepted to any of these schools.

394
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,043
You know that, right?

395
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:06,796
Yes.

396
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,131
I'm not saying you're bad.

397
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,799
You're doing well,

398
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:12,552
but there are only
a limited number of spots.

399
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:15,430
You have to raise your GPA.

400
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:16,973
Work harder, okay?

401
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,225
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:22,687
And going abroad isn't always
the best answer.

403
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,981
Staying in Korea could be a better option.

404
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:28,068
Domestic graduate schools
are pretty good too.

405
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:30,987
There's no place like Korea for Koreans,

406
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:32,113
don't you think?

407
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:35,325
Right.

408
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,744
Let's talk again next time, then.

409
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,205
What about you, Sol?

410
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:42,207
You didn't submit your list?

411
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,417
No, not yet.

412
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,045
You could start next semester.
What are you waiting for?

413
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:49,089
Is there something going on?

414
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:52,592
No.

415
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:55,553
I'll make my decision soon, ma'am.

416
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:59,391
All right.
I'd prefer it if you made it quick.

417
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:01,267
It's a waste of time.

418
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,020
You might think it won't be any different.

419
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:07,273
But there are things you can learn
from the world out there.

420
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:09,693
This is a great list.

421
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,446
Take a look at this,
and make your decision.

422
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:17,075
LIST OF PROSPECTIVE UNIVERSITIES

423
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,118
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:23,123
Why do you two look so gloomy?

425
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:25,333
You should be shining at that age.

426
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,043
Don't stay holed up in the studio.

427
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,504
You should make your life eventful

428
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:32,757
to get inspiration for your work.
Got that?

429
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:34,801
Yes.

430
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,012
Yes.

431
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:44,185
I think she said the word "inspiration"
over 100 times.

432
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,481
Just take it.

433
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:51,109
I was about to give you the file
if you needed it anyway.

434
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:53,528
Thanks. It'll be helpful.

435
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,656
It was so embarrassing, though.

436
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,283
What was?

437
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:02,203
I listed up all the great universities
without thinking about my grades.

438
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,582
I'm jealous, Sol.
You can go pretty much anywhere.

439
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:10,754
It might not be the best idea
to go abroad.

440
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,383
Honestly, it kind of feels like
I'm just trying to run away.

441
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,427
Were you thinking that too?

442
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,262
Yun Sol!

443
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:23,808
Oh, you were with Na-bi.

444
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:26,478
What did the professor say?
Why did she call you two?

445
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:27,771
It was for the exchange--

446
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:30,231
Just talking about assignment ideas.

447
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:31,441
Assignment ideas?

448
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:35,028
Why did she leave me out?
This is favoritism.

449
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,905
She just gave us a bit of advice.

450
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:38,865
We'll be off.

451
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:41,367
Oh, okay. Bye.

452
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:42,410
Bye, Na-bi.

453
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm the one who's out of ideas.

454
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:57,884
Why are you dressed so nicely?

455
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,220
Do I look nice? That's a relief.

456
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:03,014
Is it because we're gathering today?

457
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:04,307
Well…

458
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,851
my blind date was supposed to be tomorrow,

459
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:09,562
but he said something urgent came up

460
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:11,356
and asked if we could meet today.

461
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,316
Otherwise, it'll be a while later.

462
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,277
You know how you shouldn't
put off a blind date for too long.

463
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,279
So I just agreed to meet him today.

464
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:21,032
What? Then what about our gathering today?

465
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:22,534
Tell the others for me.

466
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:25,578
Hey, I didn't want to go.
You're the one who made a fuss.

467
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:27,831
I know. I'm really sorry.

468
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:29,916
But if you don't go either,

469
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:33,336
everyone will curse me to death. Please?

470
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,004
-Sol, please.
-Gosh.

471
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,297
All right.

472
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:37,215
I love you!

473
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:40,385
If things go well with my date,
I'll set you up with someone too.

474
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:41,427
There's no need.

475
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:42,846
Oh, come on.

476
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:19,632
-Hi. What brings you here?
-Hello.

477
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,467
-Hello.
-Hello.

478
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,179
-Keep working.
-Okay.

479
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,808
I already chiseled it off.

480
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,978
<i>You have to raise your GPA.</i>

481
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,285
So you're really going to stay up working?

482
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:30,703
Yes.

483
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,665
Or I might not be able to finish on time.

484
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:35,124
My progress is slow.

485
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,585
Alcohol is the best when you're stuck.

486
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:39,796
I'm going to go drink with the kids.

487
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:42,966
You don't know any of our juniors.

488
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't you need an assistant
for the exhibit?

489
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,515
At this rate, you'll be the first one
in our department to do everything alone.

490
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,272
Gosh. Never mind.

491
00:34:57,855 --> 00:34:59,524
There's no way
you'll get a new boyfriend like that.

492
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:00,775
Bye.

493
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,280
Call me if you change your mind.

494
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:07,407
Okay.

495
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,993
Have fun!

496
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:11,160
I will!

497
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:58,833
That will be 14,000 won.

498
00:35:58,916 --> 00:35:59,917
Here.

499
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:08,968
<i>It's him.</i>

500
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,429
Hang on.

501
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:25,651
<i>The library, and now this.</i>

502
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,030
<i>I must be losing my mind.</i>

503
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:35,912
<i>You're really not coming?</i>

504
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:44,796
Bit-na, where's the location?

505
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:05,817
We meet again.

506
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,698
What are you doing here?

507
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:17,787
Hey, you're here.

508
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,415
-Hi. I'm heading in first.
-Okay.

509
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:27,255
He's the junior…

510
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:29,882
who was hoping to drink with you.

511
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:34,971
I see.

512
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,515
Look! You're screwed.

513
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:42,728
Gosh, this place is flooded with seniors.

514
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:44,188
Seniors!

515
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:46,732
Are you sick of your seniors?

516
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:47,775
Not at all!

517
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:52,071
But we have a newbie now.

518
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:55,950
She made a rare appearance,
so be nice to her.

519
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,247
This is Yu Na-bi,
and this is Park Jae-eon.

520
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:04,041
<i>Park Jae-eon…</i>

521
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,460
Oh, okay.

522
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:08,546
<i>His name was Park Jae-eon.</i>

523
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:11,716
What's with the face?

524
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,094
Do you know each other?

525
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,306
No.

526
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:21,642
-It's our first time seeing each other.
-It's your first time?

527
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,144
They took turns taking a leave.

528
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:26,606
And Na-bi barely attends school events.

529
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:30,276
-That's right. She never shows up.
-But you come to all of them.

530
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,777
Hi.

531
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,618
Oh. Hi.

532
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:41,204
I just got butterflies in my stomach!

533
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:42,747
"Oh. Hi."

534
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,956
I'm getting butterflies!

535
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,876
I'm Park Jae-eon.
I'll just talk to you casually.

536
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,419
He's the same age as us.

537
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:50,421
He was a business major at K University

538
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,840
but he took the entrance exam again
to major in sculpture.

539
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:53,966
I see.

540
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,177
I saw you before, though.

541
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:58,638
What?

542
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,436
Where?

543
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:08,064
At school.

544
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,070
I said I wanted to drink with you.

545
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:15,029
Right.

546
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:17,949
So you two have finally met.

547
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,618
It's nice to meet you.

548
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,996
It's nice to meet you too.

549
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:27,875
<i>I don't believe…</i>

550
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,378
<i>in fate or love anymore.</i>

551
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:35,258
<i>But this situation…</i>

552
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:38,511
<i>It's pretty unrealistic.</i>

553
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:43,516
That professor gives us
so many assignments. It's awful.

554
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,518
You selected a bad course.

555
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,395
You took that class.
Why didn't you tell me?

556
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:49,814
-Ji-wan's still not answering?
-No.

557
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:53,651
She's not reading my messages.
I guess she's still with him.

558
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:56,529
She said she'd make it quick.
Things must be going well.

559
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:58,573
Hey, that's a given.

560
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:01,033
Ji-wan's popular with guys.

561
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:02,785
I'm so jealous.

562
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,955
So many guys asked for her number
at our high school festival.

563
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:09,166
But it seems like Ji-wan
likes the guy this time, too.

564
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,336
There's no point.
Bet she'll get sick of him within a month.

565
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,588
Right.

566
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:17,633
It's her biggest wish to go on a
couple's trip for a one-year anniversary.

567
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:19,802
-That's so cute.
-It's cute.

568
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:26,267
-I'll get it.
-It'll be hard to carry it all yourself.

569
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,561
No, it's fine.

570
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:29,645
Keep talking.

571
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:31,731
Right, so what happened?

572
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:33,024
He has a girlfriend.

573
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:48,831
Oh, my gosh.

574
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,169
I'm so sorry.

575
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:54,128
I'm okay.

576
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:55,713
Are you all right?

577
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:56,714
Yes.

578
00:40:57,632 --> 00:40:59,133
I was looking at my phone.

579
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:00,926
I'm okay.

580
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:05,514
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!

581
00:41:05,598 --> 00:41:06,432
Three! One!

582
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:07,516
-Two!
-Three!

583
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:10,895
Take off your hat.

584
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:13,481
-Hey. Here's a hair tie.
-Take it off.

585
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:15,149
Make a palm tree.

586
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:18,402
Go easy on me, please.

587
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:21,072
<i>Jae-eon is fun.</i>

588
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:22,948
You look pretty.

589
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:23,908
Jae-eon!

590
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:24,992
I'm sorry.

591
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:26,994
Off you go.

592
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:28,621
That look really suits you!

593
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:39,131
I'm really sorry, but…

594
00:41:39,215 --> 00:41:40,716
Oh, you want a glass?

595
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,051
No…

596
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:44,261
If it's okay with you…

597
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:48,391
Could you watch me dance?

598
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:50,643
Don't cover your face!

599
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:52,770
-Five, six, seven, eight!
-<i>Jae-eon has a way of</i>

600
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:55,439
<i>making naughty pranks seem rather fun.</i>

601
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,194
Twist your body!

602
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:02,113
What is that?

603
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:09,745
Come on!

604
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:12,748
This is so stupid.

605
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:14,417
Are you upset?

606
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,710
I guess he smiles a lot.

607
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,336
-Let's play another game.
-What?

608
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,587
-Let's drink.
-What?

609
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:21,090
-It's nothing.
-Come on. Drink up.

610
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:23,592
It's mine.

611
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:26,011
Come on. Cheers!

612
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:28,431
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

613
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:30,433
Can you hand me that?

614
00:42:33,894 --> 00:42:34,979
Thanks.

615
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,446
-Hey, guys. Gather round.
-What is it?

616
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:47,116
Who are the scumbags who did it
in the student council room last semester?

617
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:51,829
Then is it true that a condom was found
in the trash can?

618
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:53,539
That's disgusting!

619
00:42:53,622 --> 00:42:54,999
The sofa…

620
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,335
On the sofa?

621
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:02,006
You better fess up. Could it have been…

622
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,304
Quit playing detective.
You're barking up the wrong tree.

623
00:43:08,387 --> 00:43:09,221
What?

624
00:43:09,305 --> 00:43:10,514
Do you know who it is?

625
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:12,183
-Who is it?
-Get off me.

626
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:13,517
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

627
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:14,894
Goodness.

628
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:16,604
Do you still not know?

629
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:18,981
It's Choi Min-u.

630
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:19,940
No way!

631
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:22,485
-His girlfriend is Jeong-a.
-Then it was her and Min-u?

632
00:43:22,568 --> 00:43:25,154
Of course not. He was sleeping
with someone else.

633
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:28,699
He was cheating on her?

634
00:43:28,783 --> 00:43:30,367
That asshole!

635
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:32,119
How could he do that to her?

636
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:33,537
I feel sorry for her.

637
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:37,875
There are quite some pretty girls
who have poor judgment.

638
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,295
No wonder you're called Bit-na News.
Go, Bit-na News!

639
00:43:41,378 --> 00:43:42,379
Stop overreacting.

640
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,506
Let me pour you a shot.

641
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,800
-Oh, thank you.
-This is boring, isn't it?

642
00:43:45,883 --> 00:43:47,009
-Is your source reliable?
-Should we leave?

643
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:49,303
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Stay out of it.

644
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:51,180
-More drinks!
-Whose glass is empty?

645
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:53,224
-Me!
-You should take a break.

646
00:43:53,307 --> 00:43:54,600
-Here you go.
-Thank you, my dear.

647
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,560
-You're the best.
-So how did you find out?

648
00:43:57,686 --> 00:43:59,438
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

649
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:01,106
You dropped this.

650
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,359
Oh. Thank you.

651
00:44:07,154 --> 00:44:08,197
Look at him.

652
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:15,371
You look a bit different when you smile.

653
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:24,213
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit.

654
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:25,214
Okay.

655
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:39,603
Why do I feel so annoyed?

656
00:44:44,984 --> 00:44:47,486
I should just get back to work.

657
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:01,625
I'm going to go buy ice cream.

658
00:45:02,293 --> 00:45:03,711
Do you want to come with me?

659
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:12,761
What do you want?

660
00:45:14,513 --> 00:45:15,639
That one?

661
00:45:15,723 --> 00:45:16,765
No.

662
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,018
Then…

663
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:20,686
what about that one?

664
00:45:23,147 --> 00:45:24,231
No.

665
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:26,859
This one.

666
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:34,783
Why did you laugh?

667
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,622
Because you're cute.

668
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:43,500
Shut up.

669
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:50,090
Your style looks different.

670
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:53,761
Hey, what are you doing?

671
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:55,679
Let's skip study hall and go play games.

672
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,223
Sorry!

673
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:04,688
Why did you say you didn't know me?

674
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:07,775
Well…

675
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:11,320
I was caught off-guard.

676
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:16,909
It would've been strange to say
that I knew you.

677
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:20,037
I didn't know your name or your age.

678
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:24,917
So why did you just leave that day?

679
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:31,674
I was drunk.

680
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:37,596
Anyway, the stuff I said that day…

681
00:46:39,223 --> 00:46:40,432
Just forget everything.

682
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:42,226
What about that day?

683
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:44,311
You didn't say much.

684
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:47,272
Well…

685
00:46:48,023 --> 00:46:49,358
Just forget about it.

686
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:52,653
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

687
00:46:55,823 --> 00:46:57,199
Okay.

688
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:02,413
You didn't erase it.

689
00:47:05,874 --> 00:47:06,834
Oh, this?

690
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:12,423
Right.

691
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:14,550
I washed it, but it wouldn't come off.

692
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:16,677
That's strange.

693
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:20,055
It was a water-based marker.

694
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:25,269
Oh, really?

695
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:28,564
That's strange.

696
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:35,571
Didn't you want to see me again?

697
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:40,367
Well…

698
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:43,746
Not much.

699
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,497
But I was pretty startled.

700
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,791
I thought I'd never see you again.

701
00:47:50,252 --> 00:47:51,378
I was glad…

702
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:54,465
to see you again.

703
00:48:20,532 --> 00:48:22,951
Why are you two coming in together?

704
00:48:23,786 --> 00:48:25,120
We bought ice cream.

705
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:35,130
Love always begins with ice cream,
you know.

706
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:37,257
Come here!

707
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,928
Hey! Let's go for a smoke.

708
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:41,887
Okay.

709
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:43,597
Do you want to come?

710
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,681
She doesn't smoke.

711
00:48:46,683 --> 00:48:47,518
Really?

712
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:49,144
Be careful on the way out.

713
00:49:02,282 --> 00:49:03,951
Darn it…

714
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,918
Here. This is my number.

715
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:16,421
If you text me your bank account number
and the cost, I'll send the money.

716
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:18,382
All right. I'll keep in touch.

717
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:22,553
I'm really sorry.

718
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:23,554
It's fine.

719
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:27,266
Your head's a bit red. Are you okay?

720
00:49:28,851 --> 00:49:31,728
It's okay. My head is rock-hard.

721
00:49:31,812 --> 00:49:34,731
Are you not hurt?
I ran into you pretty hard.

722
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:36,358
I'm okay.

723
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,318
That's a relief, then.

724
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:39,987
Let's go.

725
00:49:42,406 --> 00:49:45,492
Why don't we just go
for another round somewhere?

726
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:47,870
Hello? Everyone here?

727
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:51,415
Hey, let's go.

728
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:53,417
Let's do that. All right.

729
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:57,004
-I'm off.
-Let's go together.

730
00:49:57,087 --> 00:49:58,755
-Let's go.
-We're leaving.

731
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:00,048
-Goodbye!
-Good night!

732
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:01,508
Be careful on the way home.

733
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:06,305
You seemed to have drunk a lot.
Are you all right?

734
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:08,682
Yes, I'm fine. I'm not even drunk.

735
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:11,059
What about you?

736
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:15,981
Is that your girlfriend?

737
00:50:16,064 --> 00:50:17,524
What?

738
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:20,527
I don't have a girlfriend.

739
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:22,905
I'm taking the bus here.
Careful on the way home.

740
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:25,115
Right. Bye.

741
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:52,559
We meet again.

742
00:50:52,643 --> 00:50:53,852
I like…

743
00:50:56,605 --> 00:50:57,439
butterflies.

744
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:58,774
I was glad…

745
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,860
to see you again.

746
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:04,613
I don't have a girlfriend.

747
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,076
Is this fate?

748
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:25,467
OH BIT-NA

749
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,053
<i>Guys, send 20,000 won each for the drinks.</i>

750
00:51:31,098 --> 00:51:32,933
PARK JAE-EON

751
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:18,437
Why are you awake?

752
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:21,898
Right now?

753
00:52:23,316 --> 00:52:24,735
Is it okay for me to come over?

754
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:43,795
I SENT THE MONEY
I SENT THE MONEY TOO

755
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:46,423
Is he sleeping?

756
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:52,846
He's sleeping already?

757
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:00,812
What am I doing?

758
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,671
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

759
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:29,674
Darn it. Not you.

760
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:46,008
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

761
00:53:53,348 --> 00:53:54,850
Hey, Sol.

762
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:56,602
Aren't you going for a smoke?

763
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:58,353
I already did.

764
00:53:58,437 --> 00:53:59,313
I see.

765
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:04,359
Hey, guys.
Aren't you going out for a smoke?

766
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:06,445
Just go. I'm totally busy right now.

767
00:54:06,528 --> 00:54:07,654
Go away.

768
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:10,157
What about you?

769
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,950
No. This isn't sticking.

770
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:17,080
-You're really not going?
-Just go.

771
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,008
Hi.

772
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:29,426
Hi, Na-bi.

773
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:32,179
Hey, Na-bi.

774
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:33,555
Oh, hi.

775
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:40,479
What is it, Na-bi?

776
00:54:40,562 --> 00:54:41,980
What?

777
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:44,566
It's nothing.

778
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,319
-I thought it was due today.
-I have to work late.

779
00:54:51,198 --> 00:54:52,157
-Na-bi.
-Hey.

780
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,867
-Are you looking for someone?
-No.

781
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:56,036
I'm just getting some fresh air.

782
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:03,251
Professor!

783
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:05,045
-Professor!
-Professor!

784
00:55:05,128 --> 00:55:07,839
Hey, a five-year-old
would do a better job.

785
00:55:07,923 --> 00:55:09,591
Professor!

786
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:12,010
Professor, can you help me?

787
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:15,639
Gyeong-jun! Please!

788
00:55:17,474 --> 00:55:20,560
No matter how many colors I mix,
I can't get the right color.

789
00:55:20,644 --> 00:55:22,521
I won't help you
unless you call me Mr. An.

790
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:24,523
But you're our senior.

791
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:27,401
I will be so grateful
if you could help me with this.

792
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:28,568
-No.
-Mr. An!

793
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:30,988
See? He calls me Mr. An.

794
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,823
-Gyeong-jun! Mr. An!
-I need your help.

795
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:39,788
-What should I do?
-Just apply the second layer

796
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:42,374
and coat it with primer in the end. Okay?

797
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,334
PARK JAE-EON

798
00:55:46,962 --> 00:55:48,964
He's in the group chat room, though.

799
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,842
PARK JAE-EON

800
00:55:55,053 --> 00:55:56,346
Mr. An!

801
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,723
What are you doing?

802
00:55:57,806 --> 00:55:59,808
-Gyeong-jun! I mean, Mr. An!
-Hello, ma'am.

803
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:01,810
-Why were you startled?
-Mr. An, please.

804
00:56:01,893 --> 00:56:03,645
I'm more startled at your piece.

805
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:04,980
Why is there no progress?

806
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:07,274
-I can't seem to get the color right.
-Well, I…

807
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:08,942
I'm almost done.

808
00:56:09,026 --> 00:56:11,653
This shouldn't be "almost done." Okay?

809
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:14,906
I'll work late today.

810
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,450
Working late isn't going to…

811
00:56:20,787 --> 00:56:22,831
-Let's talk later.
-Yes, ma'am.

812
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:35,552
-Hey, Bit-na.
-What?

813
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,596
Did everyone send the money last night?

814
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:39,306
What? Yes, everyone sent it.

815
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:40,390
Why?

816
00:56:40,474 --> 00:56:41,850
I was just curious.

817
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,143
They all sent it.

818
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:49,733
Jae-eon gave it to me in cash right away.

819
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,153
Oh.

820
00:56:56,448 --> 00:56:57,657
Keep going.

821
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,160
Focus, all right?

822
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:01,495
I am.

823
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:10,295
I'm so full.
My stomach's going to explode.

824
00:57:10,379 --> 00:57:11,630
Mine first.

825
00:57:11,713 --> 00:57:12,881
I can't breathe.

826
00:57:13,548 --> 00:57:15,092
But I can still eat dessert.

827
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,718
I can totally eat cake.

828
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:17,803
I can eat cake too!

829
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:19,888
I can eat it with coffee!

830
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,724
We have some time left. Shall we?

831
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:25,685
-Sure, you little foodie.
-You guys are coming too, right?

832
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:26,603
Of course.

833
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:30,065
Your stomachs are really going to explode.

834
00:57:30,148 --> 00:57:32,984
He always picks a fight
when he's going to join us anyway.

835
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:33,902
Tell me about it.

836
00:57:33,985 --> 00:57:34,903
Oh, no.

837
00:57:34,986 --> 00:57:36,571
Where are my Bluetooth earphones?

838
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:40,826
I left them at the outdoor studio.

839
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:43,120
Someone's going to steal them for sure.

840
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,457
There are security cameras everywhere.
Nobody will take them.

841
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:48,708
Right?

842
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:50,252
It's so far away.

843
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,379
-I'll just ask in our chat room.
-Wait. I'll get them.

844
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:53,880
Really?

845
00:57:53,964 --> 00:57:55,215
Yes.

846
00:57:55,298 --> 00:57:57,342
It's fine. You don't need to.

847
00:57:57,426 --> 00:57:59,928
No, I was about to go back anyway.

848
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:02,222
I'll get them and put them in your locker.

849
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:03,515
Send me your passcode.

850
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:04,975
I'm so touched.

851
00:58:05,058 --> 00:58:05,934
Thank you.

852
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:07,310
It's nothing.

853
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:09,855
She's so kind.

854
00:58:11,857 --> 00:58:12,816
What should I do?

855
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:15,944
I'm so popular.

856
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:18,530
Dream on. She'd never fall for you.

857
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:22,117
I was just saying!
Why would she do that for me?

858
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,828
She was going to head back anyway.

859
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,580
Never mind. Let's go have some cake.

860
00:58:26,663 --> 00:58:27,956
Yes!

861
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:38,884
What's this? Is it a bat?

862
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,970
A bat? It's a butterfly.

863
00:58:43,346 --> 00:58:46,308
This piece sure feels different
from all the other ones.

864
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:47,642
Right.

865
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:51,188
I don't even see him often at the studio.
When did he do all this?

866
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:53,064
He must be a genius.

867
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:55,901
Jae-eon won almost
all the competitions last year.

868
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:58,987
And he's even handsome.
Life's so unfair, isn't it?

869
00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:01,823
So that was Jae-eon's.

870
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:04,075
But where did Jae-eon…

871
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:05,619
Oh. Hi, Na-bi.

872
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:07,329
Hi.

873
00:59:07,412 --> 00:59:08,663
What brings you here?

874
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:10,624
Well…

875
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:13,251
Jin-su said he left something behind.

876
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:15,337
Did you see Bluetooth earphones
lying around?

877
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,671
-No.
-No.

878
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:18,215
You should look around.

879
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:19,174
Okay, I will.

880
00:59:25,388 --> 00:59:26,598
Oh, Jae-eon!

881
00:59:27,974 --> 00:59:28,808
Hey, Jae-eon.

882
00:59:28,892 --> 00:59:29,851
Hey.

883
00:59:29,935 --> 00:59:30,852
Hi, Jae-eon.

884
00:59:34,648 --> 00:59:35,732
Hi.

885
00:59:36,566 --> 00:59:37,567
Hi.

886
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,361
Looking for something?

887
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:41,404
No.

888
00:59:44,908 --> 00:59:46,576
Jae-eon, that's a butterfly, right?

889
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,411
She said it looks like a bat.

890
00:59:49,162 --> 00:59:51,873
You recognized it?
Everyone thinks it's a bat.

891
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:53,625
You must really like butterflies.

892
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:56,503
-Your last piece was one too.
-Do you want to see my butterflies?

893
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:57,504
Yes. Show us.

894
00:59:57,587 --> 00:59:58,713
Yes, please.

895
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,760
They're so pretty.

896
01:00:05,053 --> 01:00:08,431
Is that what your tattoo is about?
Like people get tattoos of their pets?

897
01:00:13,687 --> 01:00:14,938
Do they have names?

898
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:17,607
No, I just call them butterflies.

899
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,528
"Butterfly."

900
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:25,657
It's a pretty name.

901
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:46,469
I like…

902
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:50,098
butterflies.

903
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:52,392
"Butterfly."

904
01:00:53,018 --> 01:00:53,977
It's a pretty name.

905
01:00:54,603 --> 01:00:56,605
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me think</i>

906
01:00:56,688 --> 01:00:59,190
<i>the way my annoying ex did.</i>

907
01:00:59,274 --> 01:01:02,861
It's so stupid to read too much into
meaningless stuff.

908
01:01:05,947 --> 01:01:08,450
You idiot.

909
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:10,452
Who's an idiot?

910
01:01:14,164 --> 01:01:15,123
Don't look.

911
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:18,918
Is this seaweed?

912
01:01:21,296 --> 01:01:25,383
Why did you have to appear out of nowhere
and surprise me like that?

913
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:27,052
You're just insensitive.

914
01:01:27,594 --> 01:01:30,639
You left without a word.
I thought you had something to say.

915
01:01:33,642 --> 01:01:35,268
No, I didn't have anything…

916
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:38,688
I was just looking
for my friend's belongings.

917
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,444
<i>You know how popular you are, right?</i>

918
01:01:46,529 --> 01:01:49,324
<i>That's why you have that look
and talk that way.</i>

919
01:01:53,745 --> 01:01:54,788
What?

920
01:01:55,955 --> 01:01:57,415
There's the seaweed.

921
01:01:58,124 --> 01:01:59,584
-Come here.
-Sorry.

922
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:01,670
I'm sorry! Stop it.

923
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:03,838
-Wipe it off.
-Okay, I will.

924
01:02:03,922 --> 01:02:05,215
I'll wipe it off for you.

925
01:02:10,261 --> 01:02:12,681
-Sorry! Okay, I'll really wipe it off.
-Hang on.

926
01:02:12,764 --> 01:02:14,265
-You'd better.
-What?

927
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:16,142
-Come on, wipe it off.
-When did they get so close?

928
01:02:16,226 --> 01:02:18,561
They look pretty good together. Hey!

929
01:02:18,645 --> 01:02:19,896
What?

930
01:02:19,979 --> 01:02:21,064
Let's just go.

931
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:22,440
-Why?
-Come on. Let's go.

932
01:03:51,863 --> 01:03:55,283
Why do my shoulders hurt so much?
I wish they had high bars at school.

933
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,625
Relax.

934
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:07,212
Your back was hunched
when you were working.

935
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:10,048
Hey, let go. Wait.

936
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:12,050
Wait. Stop.

937
01:04:24,354 --> 01:04:26,231
I almost fell down.

938
01:04:37,784 --> 01:04:40,203
Bit-na says
you practically live in the studio.

939
01:04:40,787 --> 01:04:42,622
Not really.

940
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,291
I like working at night,

941
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,669
so I often stay late. What about you?

942
01:04:48,169 --> 01:04:49,587
I might try it more often.

943
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:51,089
It was fun.

944
01:04:52,632 --> 01:04:54,592
<i>As we talk,</i>

945
01:04:54,676 --> 01:04:56,594
<i>I can see different sides of Jae-eon.</i>

946
01:04:58,972 --> 01:05:00,223
I envy you.

947
01:05:01,224 --> 01:05:03,768
It used to be fun for me a long time ago.

948
01:05:05,103 --> 01:05:06,479
It's not fun anymore?

949
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:09,899
There's a lot to think about now.

950
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:13,528
And I'm not sure what to do.

951
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:15,280
You wanted to be an exchange student.

952
01:05:16,281 --> 01:05:17,615
It seems like a good goal.

953
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:19,492
It's nothing.

954
01:05:21,452 --> 01:05:24,497
It sounds special,
but lots of students do it.

955
01:05:28,501 --> 01:05:29,502
And honestly…

956
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:35,133
I just want to go somewhere far away.

957
01:05:36,718 --> 01:05:37,552
Why?

958
01:05:39,053 --> 01:05:40,972
Because of my mom and…

959
01:05:42,432 --> 01:05:44,225
Let's stop talking about this.

960
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:45,727
It's boring.

961
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,646
It's not boring to me.

962
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:51,900
You're talking about your true self.

963
01:05:53,776 --> 01:05:56,195
<i>He's different from
the first impression I had of him.</i>

964
01:05:57,322 --> 01:05:59,991
<i>I wanted to believe
that only I knew this side of him.</i>

965
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,293
There's the moon you like.

966
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:18,676
It's pretty.

967
01:06:21,888 --> 01:06:22,972
It's pretty.

968
01:06:33,858 --> 01:06:34,734
Your number.

969
01:06:40,073 --> 01:06:41,616
Oh. My number?

970
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,580
<i>It feels like something new
is about to begin.</i>

971
01:06:48,706 --> 01:06:49,958
<i>I'm probably not mistaken.</i>

972
01:06:55,713 --> 01:06:58,341
Yu Na-bi. I saved your number.

973
01:07:00,093 --> 01:07:02,303
<i>You know that I'm Na-bi.</i>

974
01:07:08,142 --> 01:07:09,185
Do you want one?

975
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:11,229
No, thanks.

976
01:07:15,316 --> 01:07:16,609
Did you get it customized?

977
01:07:17,777 --> 01:07:18,611
Yes.

978
01:07:19,737 --> 01:07:20,613
Isn't it pretty?

979
01:07:22,865 --> 01:07:24,367
Another butterfly.

980
01:07:25,243 --> 01:07:26,661
Oh, show me too.

981
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:29,747
-What?
-Your pet butterflies.

982
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:33,167
-Oh, my butterflies?
-Yes.

983
01:07:33,835 --> 01:07:34,961
Want to go see them?

984
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:42,552
I mean, I want to see the video

985
01:07:42,635 --> 01:07:45,054
that you showed your friends. Gosh.

986
01:08:00,194 --> 01:08:01,487
They're pretty.

987
01:08:05,074 --> 01:08:06,743
What do you like so much about them?

988
01:08:13,499 --> 01:08:17,462
They sometimes crawl up
onto my face like this.

989
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:20,173
It feels really nice.

990
01:08:26,095 --> 01:08:27,221
It's lovely.

991
01:08:32,393 --> 01:08:33,770
That tickles.

992
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:40,151
I want to smoke, too.

993
01:08:45,782 --> 01:08:47,283
I don't want to go back inside.

994
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,039
Me neither.

995
01:08:58,377 --> 01:08:59,754
You don't smoke, though.

996
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:02,006
Do you want to go have drinks?

997
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,132
Drinks?

998
01:09:05,968 --> 01:09:07,804
Are you going to work some more? Then…

999
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:09,931
No. Let's go.

1000
01:09:10,848 --> 01:09:11,933
Just the two of us?

1001
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,979
Well…

1002
01:09:17,063 --> 01:09:18,856
we can call our friends.

1003
01:09:19,857 --> 01:09:21,109
Should I call them?

1004
01:09:21,692 --> 01:09:22,652
Why are you laughing?

1005
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:23,945
I don't know.

1006
01:09:24,987 --> 01:09:26,280
You make me laugh.

1007
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:30,952
Are you that happy to drink with me?

1008
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:32,036
I am.

1009
01:09:44,465 --> 01:09:45,299
<i>I'm sure…</i>

1010
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:48,427
<i>that we feel the same way.</i>

1011
01:10:00,752 --> 01:10:04,792
NEVERTHELESS,

He has no interest at all in dating.</i>

1016
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:53,618

-<i>Hey!</i>

<i>Do people have to date?</i>

1020
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:03,753
<i>Why can't two people just be close?</i>

1021
01:11:03,836 --> 01:11:05,046
<i>Can't they stand near each other?</i>

1022
01:11:05,129 --> 01:11:07,465

<i>What do I want from Jae-eon?</i>

01:11:10,885 --> 01:11:13,095
<i>You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.</i>

1025
01:11:13,179 --> 01:11:17,183
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house. Do you want to come?

1026
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:19,477
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

1027
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:24,941
<i>Right. I should just check for myself
and forget about him.</i>
