1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:07,987
NEVERTHELESS,

2
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:14,006
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:15,797
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:23,122
<i>I'm sure…</i>

5
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:26,000
<i>that we feel the same way.</i>

6
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:28,669
KWON YEO-JU

7
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:39,388
I don't think I can go today.

8
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:40,389
How about tomorrow?

9
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,641
Okay. That's fine.

10
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:45,102
Sorry.

11
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:07,249
PARK JAE-EON

12
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:15,299
Jae-eon isn't the dating type.

13
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,760
What do you mean?

14
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:19,553
He may flirt but never commits.

15
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:20,930
He just draws the line.

16
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:26,268
Did he say so himself?
That he never commits?

17
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,313
Na-bi, you know what?

18
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:32,191
Flowers don't bloom
just for one butterfly.

19
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,151
What are you saying?

20
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,654
Jae-eon is like that flower.

21
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:38,155
Full of vanity,

22
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,492
a symbol of seductive beauty
that withers once it's plucked.

23
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,035
That's what Jae-eon is.

24
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,954
What's with you?

25
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:46,830
I know we're an art major, but still.

26
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:48,374
You may not know it,

27
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:50,960
but his every move is calculated.

28
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,127
Well…

29
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,964
I sometimes felt that something was off,

30
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,466
but it's not like that.

31
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,636
That's how everyone
falls for his tricks or not.

32
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,347
Actually, everyone knows.

33
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,974
They say they won't get fooled,

34
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,476
but they do when he shows
an ounce of sincerity.

35
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,020
Because they want to believe it.

36
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,190
I'm telling you.

37
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:15,526
Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.

38
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:18,779
He just likes to play with girls
who are drawn to him.

39
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:20,531
So forget him.

40
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:22,741
You don't know how to keep things casual.

41
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:26,495
What are you on about? We're just friends.

42
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:27,913
Stop lying to yourself.

43
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,957
Men and women can't be just friends.

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,959
Says the one with tons of guy friends.

45
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,670
I keep them close
since there's a possibility.

46
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:37,631
Hanging out with guys
heightens sexual tension.

47
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,174
Even Jae-eon?

48
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,719
He's not bad to hang out with.

49
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:44,304
And he's totally handsome.

50
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,140
Is it good?

51
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:48,100
You're actually eating cafeteria food?

52
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:49,560
I suggested eating here.

53
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:50,477
Right.

54
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:51,895
I'll get some water.

55
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,063
Okay.

56
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,067
What is it? Are you sick?

57
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,280
Well, I…

58
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:03,615
I just bit my tongue.

59
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:05,993
Are you all right?

60
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:08,620
Yes. I'm okay.

61
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,499
I'll be off first. Enjoy your food.

62
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,959
Where are you going?

63
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,425
You didn't forget, right?

64
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:24,928
-What?
-I'm using my wish.

65
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,514
You already used your wish.

66
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,475
Aren't you granting me another one?

67
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,478
Fine, but nothing weird.

68
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:51,705
EPISODE 2: IT'S NOT ONLY ME.
NEVERTHELESS,

69
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,371
Dance.

70
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:33,831
No.

71
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:34,832
That's my wish.

72
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:37,543
Can't we just leave?

73
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:38,877
Let's hang out here.

74
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:42,548
I can't hear anything. It's too loud.

75
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,970
What are you doing?

76
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,440
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.</i>

77
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:25,424
<i>All I see is Jae-eon.</i>

78
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,833
<i>Are you feeling the same way?</i>

79
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:24,733
Sorry.

80
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:28,987
Let's go.

81
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:38,747
What?

82
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:40,624
Why am I so red?

83
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,827
<i>I'm smoking outside.</i>

84
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,580
Can I see your ID?

85
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:20,622
Thank you.

86
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,293
Jae-eon.

87
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:34,136
You weren't reading my messages.
Were you hanging out here?

88
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:35,929
Are you alone?

89
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:38,765
Se-mi and Mi-so are inside.
Want to join us?

90
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:50,861
I'm with her.

91
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:53,614
You can hang out without me.

92
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,787
Come on, we can all hang out together.

93
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,956
We can call other guys, too.

94
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,874
<i>Jae-eon…</i>

95
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,002
<i>makes me feel anxious.</i>

96
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,879
Well…

97
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm fine.

98
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:13,717
You can go hang out with her.
I'll head home first.

99
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:15,969
Why would you leave?

100
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,766
Why don't you just go?

101
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:21,725
All right, then.

102
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:23,894
Bye.

103
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,450
Why did you try to ditch me?

104
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,452
You made me feel awkward.

105
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:42,829
You two seemed close.

106
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:45,874
I thought you should hang out with her.

107
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,168
We're not close.

108
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:51,755
We went to the same academy, is all.

109
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,173
<i>We can all hang out together.</i>

110
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,800
We can call other guys, too.

111
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,471
Is that all?

112
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,558
She looked pissed when you told her to go.

113
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:05,811
Did she?

114
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:09,648
<i>Right. Maybe it's not a big deal for you.</i>

115
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,483
She had a butterfly

116
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,152
on her wrist, too.

117
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,490
I'm not sure
if it was a drawing or a tattoo.

118
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,953
She just got it by herself.

119
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,121
By herself?

120
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:26,665
Why?

121
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,543
Maybe she wanted to see my reaction.

122
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:33,338
You know how friends from academies
sometimes hang out together.

123
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,967
But she kind of obsessed over me.

124
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,261
She was delusional.

125
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,851
Why are you suddenly so serious?

126
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,936
It has nothing to do with you,

127
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:50,272
so don't worry about it.

128
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,528
I'm taking the bus over there.

129
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,447
You're really going?

130
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,364
Yes.

131
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,283
I'm a bit tired.

132
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,539
I'll take you home. It's late.

133
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:10,000
No, there's no need.

134
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,626
Bye.

135
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:41,865
Is he just keeping me on the hook?

136
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,665
What's with him?

137
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:09,726
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

138
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:11,937
Hey, you're…

139
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,021
Stay still, will you?

140
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,148
-Put your hands like this.
-How did you enter this department?

141
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,608
So I can see all your fingers.

142
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:17,776
Like this?

143
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,319
No, cross them like this.

144
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:20,445
Like this?

145
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,572
Yes. That's it.

146
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:24,866
Where should I look?

147
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,825
Just look at me.

148
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:27,244
-Seriously?
-Hey, what are you doing?

149
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,286
What?

150
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,788
Focus here.

151
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,248
You sure don't know
how to compliment others.

152
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:32,374
Put your arms down.

153
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:33,458
You should work out. Look at that.

154
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:34,543
Lose some weight.

155
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,794
But Sol.

156
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:39,422
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
are all so pretty.

157
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:41,341
Even the shape of your face.

158
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,176
And your eyebrows are pretty.

159
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,844
I'm so jealous.

160
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,680
What should we eat for lunch?

161
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:48,890
How did you hurt yourself again?

162
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,350
Did you tell me earlier?

163
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:53,728
Gosh, why are you always randomly
jumping from topic to topic?

164
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,188
No, I'm not.

165
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,607
To me, there's always a flow.

166
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,068
Make that posture again.

167
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:01,069
Oh, what was it?

168
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,613
Just like before. Hurry up.

169
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:06,324
How was the blind date yesterday?

170
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:07,826
It was fine.

171
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:09,578
I think I'll meet him again.

172
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,746
We have a similar taste in films.

173
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,916
So we decided to watch one together
next time.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,959
That's great.

175
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,085
Hey, be careful.

176
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,045
-Just do it.
-So what happened to your forehead?

177
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,130
Oh, my forehead?

178
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,464
Yes, that's nice.

179
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:22,799
Like this?

180
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,050
Yes, just a little more.

181
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,260
-More?
-Yes.

182
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:26,344
Gosh.

183
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,431
-Like this?
-Yes, that's it.

184
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:30,890
Like this?

185
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,309
Yes.

186
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,643
Hurry up, then.

187
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:35,520
It's looking great.

188
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:39,316
Hey, Bit-na. This is my limit. Hurry up.

189
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,735
Just a few more shots.

190
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:43,862
What are you trying to make?

191
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:45,488
-Raise your legs more.
-I'm falling.

192
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:48,450
-Just a bit more.
-I'm falling, okay? I'm falling.

193
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,826
Just a bit… Hey!

194
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:50,910
Na-bi.

195
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,332
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

196
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,045
<i>Right. I'm going to draw the line.</i>

197
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:01,504
Yes, I'm fine.

198
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,633
What's up? I'm busy right now.

199
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,428
I just came to see you.

200
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,013
<i>I don't want to be a fool again.</i>

201
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,307
You didn't read my messages.

202
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,560
Did you send me messages?

203
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:16,770
I didn't see them.

204
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:19,189
Are you busy?

205
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,900
Don't you have time to eat?

206
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:27,614
I guess I should eat.

207
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,332
<i>But…</i>

208
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:38,583
Then let's eat together.

209
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,170
Sure, whatever.

210
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:44,172
Let's go.

211
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:50,804
WHERE ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO EAT LUNCH?

212
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,806
<i>What are you doing? Are you sleeping?</i>

213
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:57,811
<i>I'm sure he does this to everyone.</i>

214
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,854
<i>He's so frivolous.</i>

215
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:01,940
<i>Where are you?</i>

216
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:13,702
<i>Home.</i>

217
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:17,664
PARK JAE-EON

218
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:34,389
Hello?

219
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,599
What are you doing?

220
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:37,934
<i>Nothing much.</i>

221
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,394
Why did you call?

222
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,230
I just wanted

223
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:43,523
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

224
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,191
You're ridiculous.

225
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,568
You always say that.

226
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,820
You always say I'm funny, too.

227
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,990
I really mean it, though.

228
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,367
Jeez.

229
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,246
Don't be ridiculous.

230
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,790
<i>I know everything.</i>

231
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:24,355
Jae-eon.

232
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,149
Thank you so much.

233
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:27,984
It's nothing.

234
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:30,904
Jae-eon.

235
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:33,198
Would you like to work with me?

236
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:35,283
Oh, thank you.

237
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:41,581
We need new part-timers
at our department office.

238
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,083
Just for this semester.

239
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,042
Well, I…

240
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,503
Come on. Just think about it.

241
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:50,006
We need two people.
Min-yeong's luring Na-bi in,

242
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:53,426
and I want to lure you.

243
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:55,553
I'll think about it.

244
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:59,974
Okay. Just a little more work. Thanks.

245
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,935
Right. I'll finish up here.

246
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,603
-I'll throw that away.
-Thanks.

247
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:04,604
Good luck.

248
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:05,855
Okay.

249
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,615
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

250
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,118
Hey, Jae-eon! Did you have lunch?

251
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,995
We're going out to eat. Want to join us?

252
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:24,374
No, I have plans. Enjoy your lunch.

253
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,502
He always says he has plans.

254
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:28,545
Let's go.

255
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,442
Who is it?

256
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,032
Jae-eon?

257
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,536
What are you doing?

258
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:57,694
PARK JAE-EON

259
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,710
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

260
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:16,004
<i>I had a racy dream.</i>

261
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,008
MISSED CALL
PARK JAE-EON

262
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:21,551
What?

263
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:24,721
Darn it. I'm late.

264
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:26,681
Darn it…

265
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:44,991
Darn it.

266
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,826
<i>Why did it have to be Jae-eon?</i>

267
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,369
<i>And in my house?</i>

268
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,662
Seriously…

269
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,553
-Hello, sir.
-Yes?

270
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm Yu Na-bi from Sculpture.

271
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,432
-Oh, the morning class.
-Yes.

272
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,142
-You had a presentation to do.
-Yes.

273
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,852
Well, I…

274
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,271
I kind of overslept today.

275
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:18,566
Could I do the presentation
for this class instead?

276
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:21,069
Okay,

277
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,321
since you seemed to have rushed here.

278
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,490
You'll get some points off, though.

279
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:27,742
All right. Thank you.

280
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:28,660
Okay.

281
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:47,637
Darn it.

282
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,474
<i>Where are you?</i>

283
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:54,811
I'm sure Bit-na is taking this class.

284
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,157
He called me,
but he didn't read my messages?

285
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:10,034
Whatever.

286
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,293
Na-bi.

287
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,379
Do you take this class too?
Why have I never seen you?

288
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,464
Oh, well…

289
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,925
I usually take the morning class.

290
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:27,468
I'm only taking this today.

291
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:29,345
I overslept.

292
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,444
Are you with someone?

293
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,952
I asked Jae-eon to think about
taking the part-time job.

294
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:56,164
What about Na-bi? Is she in?

295
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:57,665
I don't know yet.

296
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,460
She said she probably can't do it, though.

297
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:02,920
Really?

298
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:06,340
Then I told Jae-eon something
I shouldn't have.

299
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,593
I'll just keep quiet for now.

300
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:12,889
Hello, it's Seong-yun.

301
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,015
Hey.

302
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:17,477
Mr. An.

303
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,897
I came for my package.

304
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,939
Oh, okay.

305
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,526
My goodness. Thank you.

306
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,447
Mr. An. I brought you a dessert.

307
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,199
Hey, you shouldn't have.

308
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:32,492
It's fine.

309
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,243
Take it.

310
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:37,038
-I appreciate it.
-Are you kidding me?

311
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:38,748
Is this the post office or what?

312
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:43,044
The pudding was expensive,
so I could only get one.

313
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:44,253
I'm really sorry.

314
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:45,630
Bye, then.

315
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,841
Gyeong-jun.

316
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:52,637
Receiving packages for the kids
is going too far, don't you think?

317
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,722
It's nothing difficult.

318
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,058
You know what it's like.

319
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:00,561
It's tough trying to receive packages
without your parents finding out.

320
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,815
It's a huge mess!

321
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:05,566
Should I tell our professor?

322
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:11,197
Hello.

323
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,657
Hey, Sol.

324
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,536
Have you still not decided on your school?
The professor always asks me that.

325
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:19,038
No, I haven't yet.

326
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:26,129
Our professor would obviously
want you to go to an elite university,

327
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:30,258
but you should choose the one
you really want to go to.

328
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:33,386
All right. I will. Thanks.

329
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:34,762
No problem.

330
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,472
-You can talk to me anytime.
-Okay.

331
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:39,308
Is this a counseling room now?

332
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,276
Did you order a package?

333
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,735
It could be the delivery guy.

334
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,821
-Take the call.
-For God's sake.

335
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:53,614
All right.

336
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:57,076
Hello?

337
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,246
<i>Hello. This is Jung Ju-hyeok.</i>

338
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:01,789
What? Who?

339
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,835
<i>Oh, you asked me to call you.
We met at the cafe.</i>

340
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,048
I'm so sorry.

341
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,634
I'm okay. Are you all right?

342
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:19,098
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

343
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:22,476
If you tell me your bank account
and price, I'll send you the money.

344
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:24,937
Well…

345
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,357
If you're free, could we meet up?

346
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,319
What? In person?

347
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:36,449
Hang on.

348
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:39,327
-Bye.
-Bye.

349
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:45,499
He's obviously trying to hit on her.

350
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,294
Stop being so nosy.

351
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,213
Gosh.

352
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:52,924
Romance is in the air now.

353
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,926
How adorable.

354
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:56,552
As you can see now,

355
00:24:57,303 --> 00:25:02,433
sometimes a character looks directly
at the camera.

356
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:04,852
The audience watching the film

357
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,105
would feel like they've locked eyes
with the actor

358
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,774
-and be startled.
-Wake up.

359
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,736
We call this
the "Tension to Camera" method.

360
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,656
-The character points a gun
-What's wrong?

361
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,491
-at the camera
-Are you sick?

362
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:20,201
or throws a punch…

363
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:23,371
<i>Why are bad hunches never wrong?</i>

364
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:26,958
Then the camera shakes.
This is another example of that.

365
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,209
I'll get it.

366
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:31,587
-No, let me…
-No, I'm the one who dropped it.

367
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:32,755
I'll get it.

368
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,760
Director François Truffaut.

369
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,179
I'm sure you would've
heard his name before.

370
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:44,517
In the last scene
of the film <i>The 400 Blows</i>,

371
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:48,229
the boy escapes from the juvenile center
and runs toward the ocean.

372
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,273
<i>I have rotten luck,</i>

373
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:53,025
-<i>and a zit pops up on my chin.</i>
-And he looks directly…

374
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:56,529
-<i>It's that day of the month.</i>
-Back then, it was taboo for actors…

375
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,156
ARE YOU COMING?
CAN YOU GET ME A PAD ON YOUR WAY?

376
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,908
Come on, go easy on me.

377
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:01,867
All right.

378
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:02,952
Gosh, seriously!

379
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:04,996
Darn it.

380
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:14,422
My stomach still hurts.

381
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,510
-Drink that.
-Thank you.

382
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,184
I feel a little better now.

383
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:30,354
Hey!

384
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:33,524
Gosh, you're going backward.

385
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:35,860
Let's take a short break.

386
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:44,118
-Jae-eon! Aren't you going for a smoke?
-Go ahead first.

387
00:26:44,744 --> 00:26:45,786
Do you want to come?

388
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,583
I have to prepare for my presentation.

389
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,168
Oh, you're presenting today?

390
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:53,878
I should really focus

391
00:26:54,503 --> 00:26:56,172
and clap really loudly.

392
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,966
Go ahead.

393
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,384
What?

394
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:03,721
Well, your friends are leaving.

395
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:05,473
Go catch up with them.

396
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:07,475
Okay.

397
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,687
You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.

398
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:25,659
I didn't…

399
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,412
Let's go.

400
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,044
What a relief.

401
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:44,845
Gosh, what is this?

402
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,599
I got totally fooled by this.

403
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:53,437
<i>You sometimes</i>

404
00:27:54,146 --> 00:27:55,689
suddenly act cold to me.

405
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:57,775
Gosh, it's really bothering me.

406
00:28:00,694 --> 00:28:03,364
Hello, I'm Sculpture major, Yu Na-bi.

407
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:12,373
Well…

408
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:18,546
The film I'm presenting today

409
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:22,258
is known
as the first science fiction film…

410
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,138
<i>Code red alert.</i>

411
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,473
<i>It's for real this time.</i>

412
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:31,517
It's…

413
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:39,900
<i>A Trip to the Moon.</i>

414
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:43,070
Director Georges Méliès
was also a magician.

415
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,114
<i>"Everyone, having your period</i>

416
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:48,409
-<i>is nothing to be ashamed of."</i>
-He was praised for his filming methods.

417
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:51,579
-<i>Yes. That's right.</i>
-Most of all…

418
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:55,291
At the time, films were not much different
from theater stages.

419
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:57,668
The director made a unique mise-en-scène

420
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:00,045
that was different
from reality or theater stages

421
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,089
by applying perspective,
space, distortion--

422
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,466
Wait.

423
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:06,635
You're talking too fast.

424
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,804
Slow down and speak clearly.

425
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,558
Okay. Well…

426
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:14,351
<i>But periods are…</i>

427
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:16,645
<i>disasters.</i>

428
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,816
Hello, I'm Fashion Design major,
Kim Yeong-min.

429
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,071
<i>Disaster victims must evacuate</i>

430
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:28,991
-<i>to a safe zone.</i>
-It is about Nosferatu.

431
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:31,368
This film is actually an adaptation

432
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:34,121
of the novel <i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker.

433
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:37,124
He changed the character's names
and some details

434
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,961
to avoid copyright issues
when he made the film.

435
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,257
Yu Na-bi!

436
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,764
Did I do something…

437
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:13,744
What are you doing?
You said you have a night class.

438
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,204
You'll get cold later.

439
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,082
Should I take it back?

440
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:23,087
But still, it could get on your--

441
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,296
It's fine.

442
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,842
<i>I feel like crying.</i>

443
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,301
<i>Why did it have to be Jae-eon?</i>

444
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:30,636
Will you tell…

445
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,349
other people?

446
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,563
Is that what you think of me?

447
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:44,066
Then if you saw me

448
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:47,236
suddenly getting a boner during class,

449
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:49,613
would you tell the others?

450
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:51,991
That's different, though.

451
00:30:52,074 --> 00:30:53,409
It's not the same,

452
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:55,953
but would you?

453
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,540
Of course not.

454
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:03,210
Really?

455
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:05,921
Of course.

456
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:09,258
Then I won't, either.

457
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:14,096
<i>Would someone like him</i>

458
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,349
<i>really be considered frivolous?</i>

459
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:45,294
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.
I WILL GET YOUR CLOTHES…

460
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,641
<i>Did you get home okay?</i>

461
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:03,938
<i>Do people act like this
to keep someone on the hook?</i>

462
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:06,899
<i>You read my message right away.
What are you doing?</i>

463
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:18,911
LAUNDROMAT

464
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:22,164
We're going to play basketball
and go out for drinks.

465
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:23,916
You should join us.

466
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:25,626
Next time. I have plans.

467
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:28,420
But weren't you wearing a shirt over that?

468
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:30,255
Where did you put it?

469
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,924
I lent it to my friend.

470
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:32,967
Friend?

471
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,969
Who was that pretty girl a while ago?

472
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:36,553
Are you two close?

473
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:38,263
Did we seem close?

474
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,189
<i>I'm buying art supplies.</i>

475
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,024
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

476
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,946
You said you're just friends.

477
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,492
Gosh. We are just friends.

478
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:01,829
We did get a bit close, though.

479
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,207
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

480
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,583
Don't change the subject.

481
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,294
Is there something going on?

482
00:33:10,504 --> 00:33:12,131
It's not like that.

483
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,883
I'm just…

484
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,428
not pushing away someone

485
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,431
who's being nice to me.

486
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,101
You're really getting your hopes up.

487
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:28,731
So you're saying he's treating you
like someone special.

488
00:33:28,814 --> 00:33:29,815
Well…

489
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,401
Maybe.

490
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,612
From what I've seen so far,

491
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,907
the things that made you feel special

492
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,701
might be meaningless to him.

493
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,912
I told you, he's nice to everyone

494
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,581
without any exception.

495
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,585
I don't know.

496
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,463
Maybe.

497
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:58,010
She has to realize it herself.

498
00:33:58,093 --> 00:34:00,554
Don't blame me later for not warning you!

499
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:07,936
Are you free tomorrow?

500
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,689
-Don't you have a gathering?
-Jae-eon told you?

501
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:12,816
I guess you two did grow close.

502
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:15,444
Did you hear who's coming?

503
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:17,154
No.

504
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,532
You should come.
All persons of interest are coming.

505
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:24,036
"Persons of interest?"

506
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:26,205
It's going to be fun.

507
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,208
And shouldn't you check for yourself?

508
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:31,752
What?

509
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,546
Whether you're really special
to Jae-eon or not.

510
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:39,551
Thank you!

511
00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:52,523
"Navi bobo"?

512
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:53,857
NAVI_BOBO: I LIKE YOUR NEW HAIR

2,432 FOLLOWERS

<i>I want my heart to keep fluttering,</i>

517
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,013

00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,101
<i>Right.</i>

<i>Bit-na, I'll join you tomorrow.</i>

522
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:27,784
Hey, isn't Sol coming today?

523
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:29,578
She's close to you.

524
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:31,079
Not really.

525
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:32,873
She's only close to Ji-wan.

526
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:36,710
And our department ace would never
eat at the same table as us.

527
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:38,837
You have lunch with her often.

528
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:40,380
You're so dramatic.

529
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:42,716
Don't you know what a metaphor is?

530
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:45,469
What are you, a kid?

531
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:46,511
Can't you stay still?

532
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,597
He's always been like that.

533
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,600
You're excited thinking
about Sol, aren't you?

534
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:53,352
Do you have a crush on her?

535
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,396
She's so quick-witted.

536
00:36:57,189 --> 00:36:58,148
Help me out, then.

537
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:00,442
Take charge of your own love life.

538
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:01,944
Yun Sol?

539
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,947
She's pretty.

540
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,116
She's also sassy and extremely skilled.

541
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,202
She's totally my style.

542
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,872
-But does she even like guys?
-What are you on about?

543
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,332
I mean,

544
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:17,793
I've never seen her hang out with guys.

545
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,670
Have you?

546
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:22,714
I've never seen Gyu-hyun
hang out with girls, either.

547
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:23,840
Then is he…

548
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,843
Are you?

549
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:29,972
-What about me? Am I a guy, then?
-Yes.

550
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:31,765
-You jerk.
-Wait.

551
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:33,600
-Let me give you a punch.
-Hey, stop.

552
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,062
What are you guys up to?

553
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:38,438
You haven't quit yet?

554
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,607
I knew it.

555
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,402
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

556
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:45,696
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

557
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:48,448
Ji-wan.

558
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,659
What's he up to now?

559
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:54,204
Can I ask you a favor?

560
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:56,123
A favor? What is it?

561
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,584
We're going out for drinks today.

562
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:01,295
Come join us with Sol.

563
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,088
Sol? Why?

564
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:04,881
Please bring her over.

565
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,842
Let him get rejected so he can shut up.

566
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:08,927
You have a crush on her?

567
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,929
I think I do.

568
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:15,142
Help me out, okay?

569
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:18,061
Come on. Help me get close to her.

570
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:19,187
Okay?

571
00:38:19,855 --> 00:38:21,189
He's serious.

572
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,025
Well, okay. I'll ask her.

573
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:23,942
Nice.

574
00:38:24,026 --> 00:38:26,653
But she might refuse.
She doesn't enjoy drinking.

575
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:29,364
I know. I'm pretty sure she won't come.

576
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,033
Okay.

577
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:34,328
-Let's go.
-You're coming? Really?

578
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,454
Why?

579
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,249
What do you mean? Didn't you want to go?

580
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,709
What?

581
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,587
Oh, right. You're right.

582
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,005
Okay, let's go together.

583
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:47,007
What's that reaction?

584
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,930
By the way,
what do you think of Yu Se-hun?

585
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:56,391
What about him?

586
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:59,269
You're not that interested in him, right?

587
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,690
He seemed pretty funny.

588
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,817
He's funny?

589
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,611
Yes.

590
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,534
Why?

591
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,827
I don't want this.

592
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,374
Se-hun, you look really stylish today.

593
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,711
Hey. This jacket's worth 20 million won.

594
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,963
-Really?
-He's loaded!

595
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:30,884
-Then buy us a big bowl of stew!
-He could just buy us this place!

596
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,888
-Se-hun!
-Keep it coming!

597
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:35,972
Hey, Na-bi's here.

598
00:39:36,056 --> 00:39:37,557
-Hi, Na-bi.
-Hi, Na-bi.

599
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,642
-Any empty…
-Let's see.

600
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:40,143
Go over there.

601
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:43,188
Na-bi. Come sit over here. Come here.

602
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:44,606
Go sit there.

603
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,483
Come on.

604
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:48,402
It's been a while.

605
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:51,196
You're attending gatherings
since you broke up?

606
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,532
You're finally free of that old dude?

607
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:55,659
She's free!

608
00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:57,202
What's with you?

609
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:59,246
Did you break up?

610
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,247
You broke up?

611
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,749
Why are you asking that?

612
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:06,753
Everyone's here except Jae-eon, right?

613
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,172
He's not reading my message.

614
00:40:09,256 --> 00:40:10,715
He always replies late.

615
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,718
Right. He's always
holding his phone, though.

616
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:17,722
He just reads the alerts and ignores them.

617
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:20,183
No, he's not that type.

618
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,520
-Where should he sit?
-We can get a chair here.

619
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:27,941
<i>"Not the dating type"?
It's like he's dating all the girls.</i>

620
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:29,443
Jae-eon's really popular.

621
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:35,949
We should add more chairs.

622
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:37,451
Sol and Ji-wan are coming, too.

623
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,743
Really?

624
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:41,288
No way. Sol is coming?

625
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,249
Didn't you hear
that Ji-wan's coming as well?

626
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:46,710
Hang on. Let me get a chair.

627
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:49,254
It's nice that you never change.

628
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:51,756
-Why are you putting that next to you?
-Because I want to.

629
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,968
Aren't you taking it off?

630
00:40:56,761 --> 00:40:57,971
What?

631
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,809
Your jacket. Why are you so startled?

632
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:04,895
What were you thinking?

633
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,980
You take it off too.

634
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:09,483
I wasn't thinking of anything.

635
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,152
Take off your jackets, guys. It's hot.

636
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:14,029
-You take it off.
-Oh, that's my water.

637
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:16,907
Oh, sorry.

638
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,367
-Is there a new cup anywhere?
-It's fine.

639
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,163
You're my senior, right?

640
00:41:24,122 --> 00:41:27,167
It's nice to meet you.
I'm a freshman. Kim Eun-han.

641
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:32,255
We ordered some food already.
Have you tried the seafood stew here?

642
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,007
No, I never tried it.

643
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,592
Do you like seafood?

644
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:37,719
Yes, I do.

645
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:39,346
That's a relief.

646
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:43,391
-Hey, go check the order.
-We're selling food at the flea market.

647
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:45,018
You should come visit our booth.

648
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:46,978
<i>We killed time with useless conversations,</i>

649
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:48,522
-<i>but the food wasn't served.</i>
-Please.

650
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,398
Yes, of course.

651
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:51,733
-<i>When things started to get boring…</i>
-Really?

652
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:52,651
Yes.

653
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:54,194
-Did he reply?
-No.

654
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:55,403
<i>…the main character appeared.</i>

655
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:56,696
It's Jae-eon!

656
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,323
-Hey!
-Why are you so late?

657
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:00,116
-Jae-eon!
-Hey! What took you so long?

658
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,035
-Look at the time!
-Don't you see what time it is?

659
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:04,913
-Your pretty face won't cut it.
-Sit over here.

660
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:08,083
<i>The sexual tension
rises dramatically at his arrival.</i>

661
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,918
-He should drink for being late!
-Why are you late?

662
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:11,545
Sorry, there was a bit of traffic.

663
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:15,590
Na-bi, you're here too.

664
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:17,217
Yes.

665
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:19,469
He's here, so let's all drink!

666
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:20,720
-Let's drink!
-Here we go!

667
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,349
-Let's clink and drink!
-Let's clink and drink!

668
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:26,476
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

669
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,686
Air clink.

670
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:31,398
This tastes so sweet.

671
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,900
I'm going to drink so much today.

672
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,485
This is spicier than I thought.

673
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,112
-Just eat.
-Here, have some water.

674
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:39,281
-Where are they going?
-Hey, stop it.

675
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:40,198
Drink some water.

676
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:42,325
Thanks.

677
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,411
He's so popular.

678
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,453
It's pretty spicy.

679
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:48,498
It's so surprising that she came here.

680
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:50,208
I asked her to join us.

681
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,460
It was that easy?

682
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,046
Gosh, stop it.

683
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,548
-Is it spicy?
-Is it?

684
00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:01,720
Look at you, you're all red.

685
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,349
Aren't girls better at eating spicy food
than guys?

686
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:08,059
Is that so?

687
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:10,020
I read somewhere

688
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:14,065
that women naturally endure pain better
since they have to give birth.

689
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:17,277
And you know, when it's their first time--

690
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,486
What did you say?

691
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:21,906
Damn it, I'm losing my appetite.

692
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,659
I should report you.

693
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:25,660
Stop the nonsense.

694
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:27,162
Hey.

695
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:29,247
Why do you always cross the line?

696
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:31,041
What?

697
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:33,668
Tasting spiciness
is feeling a sense of pain.

698
00:43:33,752 --> 00:43:35,587
Stop treating me like a pervert.

699
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:38,673
Just wipe your dirty mouth.

700
00:43:39,674 --> 00:43:42,427
Wow. Sol, you're so cool.

701
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,887
Stop it.

702
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,481
Hey!

703
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:58,068
Here. Have a drink.

704
00:43:58,151 --> 00:43:59,194
You ruined the vibe!

705
00:43:59,277 --> 00:44:00,654
-What have you done?
-Stop talking!

706
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:01,863
You want to drink something?

707
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:03,406
-Exactly!
-Do something.

708
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,532
-Yes!
-Let's bring back the vibe.

709
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:05,950
-Let's go!
-Should we keep it going?

710
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,869
-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!

711
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:10,205
-This one.
-Zero, zero, seven!

712
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:14,000
Lime? Is this good?

713
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,336
I don't know. I think you'll like it.

714
00:44:17,629 --> 00:44:18,755
Me?

715
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,382
You said so at the club.

716
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:22,425
Here.

717
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,804
Is this lime?

718
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:26,971
I like lime.

719
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,065
You remember that?

720
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:49,160
It's strange.

721
00:44:50,245 --> 00:44:52,163
Don't people try smoking out of curiosity?

722
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:53,581
You tried mine before.

723
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,917
What? When?

724
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,337
You always refused when I offered.

725
00:44:59,421 --> 00:45:01,047
I was just curious.

726
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,341
Forget it. I feel so hurt now.

727
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:05,552
Na-bi,

728
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:08,054
you look like you're in a good mood.

729
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:14,227
What do you mean?

730
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,105
You looked a bit upset
so I thought you weren't feeling well.

731
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,066
I was uncomfortable with too many people.

732
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,111
Right. You're shy with strangers.

733
00:45:23,194 --> 00:45:24,529
Even with me?

734
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:29,075
You weren't like that before.
You smiled all the time.

735
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,660
I thought you were angry.

736
00:45:30,743 --> 00:45:34,247
Gosh. Why are you showing
so much interest in her today?

737
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:36,875
What?

738
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:40,378
Is there something going on
between you two?

739
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:41,963
It seems like it.

740
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,757
I did think it was strange.

741
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:45,717
It's…

742
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,177
It's nothing like that.

743
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,096
Don't lie to me.

744
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,973
I can tell by your expressions.
Aren't I right?

745
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:54,851
What's with you? There's nothing going on.

746
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:57,187
Right?

747
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:02,859
Yes.

748
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:04,777
Right.

749
00:46:05,403 --> 00:46:06,279
No?

750
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,906
That's strange.

751
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,283
Didn't you keep looking at him, Na-bi?

752
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:12,744
You kept looking at him.

753
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:14,621
I'm going to the bathroom.

754
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:17,582
I'll come with you. Damn it.

755
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:23,087
He doesn't know how you feel,

756
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:25,215
so he said that in case
it would get awkward.

757
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,050
Forget it.

758
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:29,052
If that was really the case,

759
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:33,223
he would've just changed the subject
or said something vague.

760
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:37,310
Right?

761
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:40,813
<i>I'm sure he didn't say that just for me.</i>

762
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:43,608
He just drew the line.

763
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:45,777
Hey, don't say it like that.

764
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,780
-You're overreacting.
-Didn't you know this would happen?

765
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:50,073
What's with the pep talk?

766
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:53,034
Well, I thought maybe
I was being too harsh.

767
00:46:53,117 --> 00:46:55,537
It's not like I can read his mind.

768
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,081
Plus, he kept looking at you.

769
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,335
No way. He was busy chatting with Yun-ji.

770
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:06,130
No! He kept glancing at you
whenever you spoke.

771
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:08,299
And most importantly,

772
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:13,513
he doesn't do stuff like this.

773
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:21,145
Bit-na, this is just a 3,000 won drink.

774
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,523
Anyway, this is different.

775
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:27,026
Honestly, I wasn't sure
when I heard your side of the story,

776
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,821
but seeing it in person,
I can sense something.

777
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:36,911
Are you going to stay?

778
00:47:36,995 --> 00:47:38,580
No. I want to go home.

779
00:47:39,664 --> 00:47:41,332
Let's go to your place with Jae-eon.

780
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,793
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

781
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:45,295
I'll come with you!

782
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:47,297
We can't waste an opportunity like this.

783
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:50,133
But still…

784
00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:54,345
Forget it. I'm going to go home.

785
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:55,597
I don't feel like it.

786
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:58,141
Let's at least ask him.

787
00:47:58,224 --> 00:47:59,309
Goodness.

788
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:02,186
There's really nothing going on
between you two?

789
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,856
I know. You said you don't date.

790
00:48:05,523 --> 00:48:08,276
It seems like she's hitting on you
without knowing that.

791
00:48:08,943 --> 00:48:12,071
She was acting like she's all that
because she's a bit pretty.

792
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,781
Serves her right.

793
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:17,535
Min-sang, don't say stuff about people
you can't say to their faces.

794
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:19,078
-What?
-You're badmouthing her

795
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,663
just because you can't have her.

796
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,373
It's pathetic.

797
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:23,833
What did you just say?

798
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,585
I'm telling you to watch your mouth.

799
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:32,425
You asshole. You just said there was
nothing going on between you and Na-bi.

800
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,553
-Hey, where were you?
-<i>Pajeon</i> must be out.

801
00:48:35,637 --> 00:48:37,472
Come on, or I'll eat everything.

802
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:38,973
Yes, I'm coming.

803
00:48:41,434 --> 00:48:42,977
Let's go eat.

804
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:49,442
<i>Jae-eon seems totally unbothered.</i>

805
00:48:53,488 --> 00:48:54,572
Don't worry about him.

806
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,618
-What?
-He goes around talking about me, too.

807
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:01,621
Like what?

808
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:03,915
That you don't date?

809
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:09,295
Do people have to date?

810
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,632
Not necessarily.

811
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:14,467
Right?

812
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,222
I have a friend who doesn't date either.

813
00:49:19,305 --> 00:49:22,850
But unlike you, he's a bit cold.

814
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:23,851
Especially to girls.

815
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,896
Why can't two people

816
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,482
just be close?

817
00:49:30,775 --> 00:49:32,527
Can't they look at each other

818
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:35,071
or stand near each other?

819
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,872
Do they have to pretend not to notice

820
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:47,542
if there's something in their hair?

821
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:53,381
That's not what I mean.

822
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,425
Right?

823
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:57,760
It's nice to get along well.

824
00:50:01,055 --> 00:50:02,640
<i>"Is that really all?"</i>

825
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:05,351
<i>But I didn't ask him that.</i>

826
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,145
Who wants to go for another round?

827
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:09,689
Me!

828
00:50:09,772 --> 00:50:11,190
-Just go home.
-You go!

829
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,483
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

830
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:14,569
Are you going?

831
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:16,446
-Well…
-Jae-eon, are you going?

832
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,157
Well, if everyone's going…

833
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,950
I have other plans.

834
00:50:21,033 --> 00:50:23,119
What? Is it important?

835
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,412
It's just a friend.

836
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:29,250
<i>Today seems like a perfect day
to get rid of my feelings.</i>

837
00:50:36,215 --> 00:50:37,258
What is it?

838
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:41,053
I'm wondering if I should
see my friend or join the others.

839
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:42,346
What about you?

840
00:50:45,558 --> 00:50:46,559
<i>But I…</i>

841
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,979
Well…

842
00:50:51,105 --> 00:50:53,107
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house.

843
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:54,192
Do you want to come?

844
00:50:58,654 --> 00:51:00,031
<i>I give up that chance</i>

845
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:02,533
<i>and decide to become a fun girl.</i>

846
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:04,727
<i>National!</i>

847
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,812
-Singing Contest!
-Singing Contest!

848
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:12,777
All right. "Love."

849
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,153
-"Love"?
-"Love."

850
00:51:14,236 --> 00:51:15,488
<i>I've fallen in love</i>

851
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:18,449
<i>-I've fallen in love
-I've fallen in love</i>

852
00:51:18,532 --> 00:51:21,285
<i>Love, love, love, my love</i>

853
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,745
You don't know?

854
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:25,623
<i>Come here, my love</i>

855
00:51:25,706 --> 00:51:28,125
-You don't know this?
-Keep going. What's wrong?

856
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,794
We won't accept that. Drink up.

857
00:51:29,877 --> 00:51:31,712
-Drink.
-But I…

858
00:51:31,796 --> 00:51:35,257
-Drink up.
-I'll drink it for you.

859
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,218
What was that?

860
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:38,177
All right.

861
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,096
<i>Keep it going</i>

862
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:41,555
<i>-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!</i>

863
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,265
Let's do the Alphabet Game.

864
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,476
-"L"!
-"L"?

865
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:47,812
Lion.

866
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:49,355
Leaf.

867
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:50,439
I got it. Lie!

868
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:51,857
Love.

869
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:55,194
Oh, me! Left!

870
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,696
Life.

871
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:58,114
Long.

872
00:51:58,197 --> 00:51:59,240
Gosh, what do I do?

873
00:51:59,323 --> 00:52:00,700
-Only the two of you left.
-Wait. Let me think.

874
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:01,867
What do I do?

875
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:05,246
I know! Lust!

876
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:09,083
-Oh, come on!
-What? It starts with "L"!

877
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,418
Yes, you're right. Fine.

878
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:11,377
Gosh.

879
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,381
All right. Then Na-bi is the loser!

880
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,550
You have to drink the whole glass

881
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,885
-in one go. Here.
-In one go.

882
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,887
<i>Who's going to drink?</i>

883
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:24,598
<i>-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!
-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!</i>

884
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:28,644
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

885
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:31,230
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

886
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:34,817
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

887
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,445
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

888
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,492
-Oh, my gosh!
-What the hell?

889
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,911
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

890
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:47,621
All right. Be quiet.

891
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:49,832
-What? You're going to do it?
-Are you?

892
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:51,500
Okay, move over.

893
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,463
What? Really?

894
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,844
Let me do it properly.

895
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:07,099
Wait. I think I'm bleeding.

896
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,726
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm bleeding. But it's okay.

897
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:10,060
Your braces?

898
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,396
This is crazy!

899
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,397
No way!

900
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:17,693
-That's crazy!
-That's crazy!

901
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,820
Guys, be quiet.

902
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:22,364
The neighbors will complain.

903
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:25,201
Hey, keep it down.

904
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,662
What?

905
00:53:28,746 --> 00:53:30,080
I told you to be quiet.

906
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:31,332
Sorry.

907
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:32,249
Yes?

908
00:53:35,628 --> 00:53:36,587
Excuse me.

909
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:42,134
Don't you know how late it is?
Please be quiet.

910
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,136
You're being way too loud.

911
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:46,013
I'm sorry.

912
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:48,015
You have neighbors, you know.

913
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:52,645
I have some friends over, so…

914
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,106
We'll be careful.

915
00:53:57,858 --> 00:54:00,069
We're taking an exam tomorrow.

916
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:01,445
Oh, really?

917
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,824
Then we'll silently pray for you
to get a good score.

918
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,408
Thank you.

919
00:54:06,992 --> 00:54:09,578
We'll trust that you'll be quiet.
Bye, then.

920
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:12,289
-Bye.
-I'm sorry.

921
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:32,476
You were like a couple.

922
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,644
Be quiet.

923
00:54:34,353 --> 00:54:36,230
-Stop playing drinking games.
-We can't stop!

924
00:54:36,313 --> 00:54:38,357
-Come on.
-Come on!

925
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,693
Let's not stop!
Let's spin it one more time!

926
00:54:40,776 --> 00:54:41,986
Spin it!

927
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:43,487
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

928
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,698
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

929
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,449
Just a little more.

930
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:49,577
-It's me!
-Yes!

931
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,829
-It's me!
-What are you talking about?

932
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:53,122
It's me.

933
00:54:53,205 --> 00:54:55,124
-Sol. Come here.
-What?

934
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:56,917
-You're going to do it?
-She must be drunk.

935
00:54:57,501 --> 00:54:58,794
You're really going to kiss her?

936
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:01,338
-Hey.
-Sit back down.

937
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:02,882
Sit down.

938
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:03,966
Come on!

939
00:55:04,049 --> 00:55:05,467
Gosh.

940
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,469
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

941
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:08,762
I'm going out for a smoke.

942
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:11,849
-What about me?
-She left because of you.

943
00:55:11,932 --> 00:55:13,434
Be quiet.

944
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,103
JUNG JU-HYEOK

945
00:55:16,186 --> 00:55:17,187
This is Sol's.

946
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:19,148
Hey, Sol!

947
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:20,399
Hey.

948
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:23,444
Jung Ju-hyeok? Who is this guy?

949
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:24,445
Jung Ju-hyeok?

950
00:55:24,528 --> 00:55:25,571
Yes.

951
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:27,656
That's not important right now. Spin!

952
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,824
Spin!

953
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,369
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

954
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,722
Did you plan this in advance?

955
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,434
What does this make us look like?

956
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:57,728
You kissed by choice, that's all.

957
00:55:58,228 --> 00:55:59,855
Forget it. Let's go for a smoke.

958
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,898
Let's go.

959
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:02,274
I'm exhausted.

960
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,317
My legs hurt.

961
00:56:04,151 --> 00:56:06,362
-My gosh.
-Gosh, my legs.

962
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:07,738
Hey, I'm wearing your shoes!

963
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:09,281
Oh, my back.

964
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,574
My shoes.

965
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,576
-I'll be back later, Na-bi.
-Okay.

966
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:14,703
Sol!

967
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,331
You're smoking too?

968
00:56:17,414 --> 00:56:19,291
Yes. But who's Jung Ju-hyeok?

969
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,251
He just called you.

970
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:23,629
What? Oh.

971
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:24,964
Just someone I know.

972
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:26,298
Someone you know?

973
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,425
I thought I knew everyone you knew.

974
00:56:28,509 --> 00:56:29,677
You don't.

975
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,641
It's cold outside.

976
00:56:37,142 --> 00:56:38,560
Thank you.

977
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,441
What were you doing?

978
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,485
Just taking a walk.

979
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:48,278
Your place is so nice.

980
00:56:48,362 --> 00:56:49,697
My aunt used to live here.

981
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:55,160
Why did you make things
so hard for yourself?

982
00:56:58,163 --> 00:56:59,581
I know, right?

983
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,674
Hey…

984
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:12,553
Sol is so beautiful up close.

985
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:15,097
She's a goddess.

986
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,724
We get it, so just tell her!

987
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,851
Please stop torturing us!

988
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:21,812
Ji-wan.

989
00:57:22,354 --> 00:57:24,481
What type of guy does Sol like?

990
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:26,317
He's driving me crazy.

991
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,028
I don't want to tell you.

992
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:30,279
You don't want to tell me?

993
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:31,947
What?

994
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:35,242
Why? You said you'd help me.

995
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,994
She doesn't seem to know, either.

996
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:39,079
There's no way.

997
00:57:39,163 --> 00:57:40,914
Who else would know, then?

998
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,501
Sol…

999
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:46,962
Yes?

1000
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,215
She hates boring guys like you.

1001
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:53,635
Come on. I'm nothing but fun.

1002
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,429
If you took the fun part out of me,

1003
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,307
I'd be a zombie. Right?

1004
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,850
Don't smoke so much.

1005
00:57:59,933 --> 00:58:01,352
But where's Jae-eon?

1006
00:58:01,435 --> 00:58:02,936
I don't know. Is he inside?

1007
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,147
You're totally ignoring me.

1008
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:08,400
He must be on his phone.
He's always calling someone.

1009
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:10,861
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Yun-ji, either.

1010
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,532
Did those two leave together?

1011
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:19,244
Call them. Come on.

1012
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:21,705
Let's go find them.

1013
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,755
Where did he go?

1014
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:32,966
What?

1015
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:35,302
What? It's nothing.

1016
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:37,888
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

1017
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:39,932
Sure. I'll get them.

1018
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:41,725
Thank you. Let me use the bathroom.

1019
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,111
That tickles!

1020
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:05,958
Stop it.

1021
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:10,963
It tickles!

1022
00:59:20,722 --> 00:59:22,641
Gosh, that startled me.

1023
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,813
This is so embarrassing.

1024
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:32,276
Listen.

1025
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:36,905
I know this is shameless of me,
but can you keep this a secret?

1026
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:38,449
Please don't tell the others.

1027
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:45,080
All right. I won't.

1028
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,290
Thank you so much.

1029
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:47,249
Thank you.

1030
00:59:47,332 --> 00:59:49,460
All right. I get it.

1031
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:53,380
-Now go on.
-I won't let go of this hand.

1032
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,007
Okay, don't. Just go.

1033
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,633
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

1034
00:59:56,717 --> 00:59:57,593
I'm sorry.

1035
00:59:57,676 --> 00:59:59,344
-When did you…
-I'll tell you later.

1036
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:01,013
Let's go.

1037
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:12,691
I must've been crazy.
How could I have thought he was Jae-eon?

1038
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,417
What? That's it?

1039
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:40,260
Just tell me if you're not up for it.

1040
01:00:41,386 --> 01:00:42,638
It's not like that.

1041
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:45,432
Go inside first. I need to make a call.

1042
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,091
It was just a game.

1043
01:01:21,385 --> 01:01:22,886
I guess she wanted to try it.

1044
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,600
You don't need to explain.

1045
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:30,686
What about you?

1046
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,940
Didn't you want to try it?

1047
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:38,652
Why would I?

1048
01:01:40,612 --> 01:01:41,613
Not at all.

1049
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,080
I wanted to do it with you.

1050
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,504
What?

1051
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:14,146
I thought…

1052
01:02:15,355 --> 01:02:17,149
you felt the same way.

1053
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:51,475
I won't do it if you don't want to.

1054
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:22,589
Sorry.

1055
