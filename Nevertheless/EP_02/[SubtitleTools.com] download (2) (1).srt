1
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,233
<i>I'm sure…</i>

2
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:25,111
<i>that we feel the same way.</i>

3
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:27,780
KWON YEO-JU

4
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,500
I don't think I can go today.

5
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,501
How about tomorrow?

6
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:41,753
Okay. That's fine.

7
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,214
Sorry.

8
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:06,361
PARK JAE-EON

9
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:14,410
Jae-eon isn't the dating type.

10
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:16,871
What do you mean?

11
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,665
He may flirt but never commits.

12
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,041
He just draws the line.

13
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,380
Did he say so himself?
That he never commits?

14
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:28,424
Na-bi, you know what?

15
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,302
Flowers don't bloom
just for one butterfly.

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,263
What are you saying?

17
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:35,765
Jae-eon is like that flower.

18
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,267
Full of vanity,

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,603
a symbol of seductive beauty
that withers once it's plucked.

20
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:42,146
That's what Jae-eon is.

21
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,065
What's with you?

22
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:45,942
I know we're an art major, but still.

23
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,485
You may not know it,

24
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:50,071
but his every move is calculated.

25
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:51,239
Well…

26
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,075
I sometimes felt that something was off,

27
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,578
but it's not like that.

28
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:59,747
That's how everyone
falls for his tricks or not.

29
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,458
Actually, everyone knows.

30
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,085
They say they won't get fooled,

31
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:06,588
but they do when he shows
an ounce of sincerity.

32
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:09,132
Because they want to believe it.

33
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,302
I'm telling you.

34
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:14,637
Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.

35
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,891
He just likes to play with girls
who are drawn to him.

36
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:19,642
So forget him.

37
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,853
You don't know how to keep things casual.

38
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:25,607
What are you on about? We're just friends.

39
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,025
Stop lying to yourself.

40
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:29,068
Men and women can't be just friends.

41
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,070
Says the one with tons of guy friends.

42
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,781
I keep them close
since there's a possibility.

43
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:36,743
Hanging out with guys
heightens sexual tension.

44
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,286
Even Jae-eon?

45
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,830
He's not bad to hang out with.

46
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,416
And he's totally handsome.

47
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,251
Is it good?

48
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,211
You're actually eating cafeteria food?

49
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,671
I suggested eating here.

50
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:49,589
Right.

51
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,007
I'll get some water.

52
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,175
Okay.

53
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:56,179
What is it? Are you sick?

54
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,391
Well, I…

55
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,727
I just bit my tongue.

56
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,104
Are you all right?

57
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:07,732
Yes. I'm okay.

58
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,611
I'll be off first. Enjoy your food.

59
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,071
Where are you going?

60
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,536
You didn't forget, right?

61
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,040
-What?
-I'm using my wish.

62
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,626
You already used your wish.

63
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,586
Aren't you granting me another one?

64
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,589
Fine, but nothing weird.

65
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:50,817
EPISODE 2: IT'S NOT ONLY ME.
NEVERTHELESS,

66
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:31,482
Dance.

67
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:32,942
No.

68
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:33,943
That's my wish.

69
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:36,654
Can't we just leave?

70
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:37,989
Let's hang out here.

71
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,659
I can't hear anything. It's too loud.

72
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,081
What are you doing?

73
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:58,551
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.</i>

74
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:24,535
<i>All I see is Jae-eon.</i>

75
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,945
<i>Are you feeling the same way?</i>

76
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:23,845
Sorry.

77
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,099
Let's go.

78
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:37,859
What?

79
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:39,735
Why am I so red?

80
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:15,938
<i>I'm smoking outside.</i>

81
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,691
Can I see your ID?

82
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:19,734
Thank you.

83
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:23,404
Jae-eon.

84
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:33,247
You weren't reading my messages.
Were you hanging out here?

85
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,041
Are you alone?

86
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,877
Se-mi and Mi-so are inside.
Want to join us?

87
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:49,972
I'm with her.

88
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,725
You can hang out without me.

89
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,899
Come on, we can all hang out together.

90
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,068
We can call other guys, too.

91
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:02,985
<i>Jae-eon…</i>

92
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,113
<i>makes me feel anxious.</i>

93
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:07,990
Well…

94
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:08,991
I'm fine.

95
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,828
You can go hang out with her.
I'll head home first.

96
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,081
Why would you leave?

97
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,877
Why don't you just go?

98
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:20,836
All right, then.

99
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,005
Bye.

100
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:37,561
Why did you try to ditch me?

101
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,563
You made me feel awkward.

102
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:41,941
You two seemed close.

103
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,986
I thought you should hang out with her.

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,280
We're not close.

105
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,866
We went to the same academy, is all.

106
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,285
<i>We can all hang out together.</i>

107
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:53,911
We can call other guys, too.

108
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:58,582
Is that all?

109
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,670
She looked pissed when you told her to go.

110
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:04,922
Did she?

111
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,759
<i>Right. Maybe it's not a big deal for you.</i>

112
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,594
She had a butterfly

113
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,264
on her wrist, too.

114
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:17,601
I'm not sure
if it was a drawing or a tattoo.

115
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,064
She just got it by herself.

116
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:23,232
By herself?

117
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:25,776
Why?

118
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,654
Maybe she wanted to see my reaction.

119
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,450
You know how friends from academies
sometimes hang out together.

120
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,078
But she kind of obsessed over me.

121
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,372
She was delusional.

122
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,962
Why are you suddenly so serious?

123
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,048
It has nothing to do with you,

124
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,383
so don't worry about it.

125
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,639
I'm taking the bus over there.

126
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:57,558
You're really going?

127
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:58,476
Yes.

128
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:00,394
I'm a bit tired.

129
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,650
I'll take you home. It's late.

130
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:09,111
No, there's no need.

131
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:10,738
Bye.

132
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,976
Is he just keeping me on the hook?

133
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,777
What's with him?

134
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:08,838
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

135
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,048
Hey, you're…

136
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,133
Stay still, will you?

137
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,260
-Put your hands like this.
-How did you enter this department?

138
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:15,719
So I can see all your fingers.

139
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:16,887
Like this?

140
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:18,430
No, cross them like this.

141
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:19,557
Like this?

142
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,684
Yes. That's it.

143
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:23,978
Where should I look?

144
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:24,937
Just look at me.

145
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,355
-Seriously?
-Hey, what are you doing?

146
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,398
What?

147
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:28,899
Focus here.

148
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,359
You sure don't know
how to compliment others.

149
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:31,485
Put your arms down.

150
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:32,570
You should work out. Look at that.

151
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:33,654
Lose some weight.

152
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:34,905
But Sol.

153
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:38,534
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
are all so pretty.

154
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:40,452
Even the shape of your face.

155
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:42,288
And your eyebrows are pretty.

156
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:43,956
I'm so jealous.

157
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,791
What should we eat for lunch?

158
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,002
How did you hurt yourself again?

159
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:49,461
Did you tell me earlier?

160
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:52,840
Gosh, why are you always randomly
jumping from topic to topic?

161
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:54,300
No, I'm not.

162
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,719
To me, there's always a flow.

163
00:11:57,553 --> 00:11:59,180
Make that posture again.

164
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:00,181
Oh, what was it?

165
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:02,725
Just like before. Hurry up.

166
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,436
How was the blind date yesterday?

167
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,937
It was fine.

168
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:08,689
I think I'll meet him again.

169
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:10,858
We have a similar taste in films.

170
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:14,028
So we decided to watch one together
next time.

171
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,070
That's great.

172
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:16,197
Hey, be careful.

173
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,157
-Just do it.
-So what happened to your forehead?

174
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,241
Oh, my forehead?

175
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:20,576
Yes, that's nice.

176
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:21,911
Like this?

177
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,162
Yes, just a little more.

178
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:24,371
-More?
-Yes.

179
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,456
Gosh.

180
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:28,542
-Like this?
-Yes, that's it.

181
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,002
Like this?

182
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,420
Yes.

183
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,755
Hurry up, then.

184
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,632
It's looking great.

185
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:38,427
Hey, Bit-na. This is my limit. Hurry up.

186
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:40,846
Just a few more shots.

187
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,973
What are you trying to make?

188
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:44,600
-Raise your legs more.
-I'm falling.

189
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:47,561
-Just a bit more.
-I'm falling, okay? I'm falling.

190
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:48,938
Just a bit… Hey!

191
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,022
Na-bi.

192
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:54,443
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

193
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:59,156
<i>Right. I'm going to draw the line.</i>

194
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:00,616
Yes, I'm fine.

195
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,744
What's up? I'm busy right now.

196
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:07,539
I just came to see you.

197
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:09,124
<i>I don't want to be a fool again.</i>

198
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,418
You didn't read my messages.

199
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:14,672
Did you send me messages?

200
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,881
I didn't see them.

201
00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:18,300
Are you busy?

202
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,011
Don't you have time to eat?

203
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:26,725
I guess I should eat.

204
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,443
<i>But…</i>

205
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:37,695
Then let's eat together.

206
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,282
Sure, whatever.

207
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,284
Let's go.

208
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:49,915
WHERE ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO EAT LUNCH?

209
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,917
<i>What are you doing? Are you sleeping?</i>

210
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:56,922
<i>I'm sure he does this to everyone.</i>

211
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:58,966
<i>He's so frivolous.</i>

212
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,051
<i>Where are you?</i>

213
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:12,813
<i>Home.</i>

214
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:16,775
PARK JAE-EON

215
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,500
Hello?

216
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:35,711
What are you doing?

217
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,046
<i>Nothing much.</i>

218
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,505
Why did you call?

219
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,342
I just wanted

220
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:42,635
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

221
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:44,303
You're ridiculous.

222
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,679
You always say that.

223
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,931
You always say I'm funny, too.

224
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:51,101
I really mean it, though.

225
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,479
Jeez.

226
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:57,358
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:14:58,317 --> 00:14:59,902
<i>I know everything.</i>

228
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,467
Jae-eon.

229
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,260
Thank you so much.

230
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,096
It's nothing.

231
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:30,015
Jae-eon.

232
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,309
Would you like to work with me?

233
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:34,395
Oh, thank you.

234
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:40,693
We need new part-timers
at our department office.

235
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,194
Just for this semester.

236
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,153
Well, I…

237
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,614
Come on. Just think about it.

238
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:49,118
We need two people.
Min-yeong's luring Na-bi in,

239
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,538
and I want to lure you.

240
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:54,665
I'll think about it.

241
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,086
Just a little more work. Thanks.

242
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,046
Right. I'll finish up here.

243
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,715
-I'll throw that away.
-Thanks.

244
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:03,716
Good luck.

245
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,967
Okay.

246
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,727
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

247
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,229
Hey, Jae-eon! Did you have lunch?

248
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:20,107
We're going out to eat. Want to join us?

249
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,485
No, I have plans. Enjoy your lunch.

250
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,613
He always says he has plans.

251
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:27,656
Let's go.

252
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:50,554
Who is it?

253
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,144
Jae-eon?

254
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,647
What are you doing?

255
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:56,805
PARK JAE-EON

256
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,821
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

257
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,115
<i>I had a racy dream.</i>

258
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,119
MISSED CALL
PARK JAE-EON

259
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:20,662
What?

260
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:23,832
Darn it. I'm late.

261
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,792
Darn it…

262
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:44,227
Darn it.

263
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:46,063
<i>Why did it have to be Jae-eon?</i>

264
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:47,606
<i>And in my house?</i>

265
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:48,899
Seriously…

266
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:04,790
-Hello, sir.
-Yes?

267
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,917
I'm Yu Na-bi from Sculpture.

268
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,669
-Oh, the morning class.
-Yes.

269
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:10,379
-You had a presentation to do.
-Yes.

270
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,089
Well, I…

271
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:14,508
I kind of overslept today.

272
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:17,803
Could I do the presentation
for this class instead?

273
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,557
Since you seemed to have rushed here.

274
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,726
You'll get some points off, though.

275
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,979
All right. Thank you.

276
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:27,896
Okay.

277
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,873
Darn it.

278
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:50,711
<i>Where are you?</i>

279
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:54,047
I'm sure Bit-na is taking this class.

280
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,394
He called me,
but he didn't read my messages?

281
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,271
Whatever.

282
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,529
Na-bi.

283
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:20,615
Do you take this class too?
Why have I never seen you?

284
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,701
Oh, well…

285
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:25,162
I usually take the morning class.

286
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,705
I'm only taking this today.

287
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:28,582
I overslept.

288
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,680
Are you with someone?

289
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:52,189
I asked Jae-eon to think about
taking the part-time job.

290
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:55,400
What about Na-bi? Is she in?

291
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:56,902
I don't know yet.

292
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:59,696
She said she probably can't do it, though.

293
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:02,157
Really?

294
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:05,577
Then I told Jae-eon something
I shouldn't have.

295
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,829
I'll just keep quiet for now.

296
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,125
Hello, it's Seong-yun.

297
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:13,251
Hey.

298
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,713
Mr. An.

299
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:20,133
I came for my package.

300
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:21,176
Oh, okay.

301
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:24,763
My goodness. Thank you.

302
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:28,683
Mr. An. I brought you a dessert.

303
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,435
Hey, you shouldn't have.

304
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,728
It's fine.

305
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:33,480
Take it.

306
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:36,274
-I appreciate it.
-Are you kidding me?

307
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:37,984
Is this the post office or what?

308
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:42,280
The pudding was expensive,
so I could only get one.

309
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:43,490
I'm really sorry.

310
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:44,866
Bye, then.

311
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:48,078
Gyeong-jun.

312
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,873
Receiving packages for the kids
is going too far, don't you think?

313
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,959
It's nothing difficult.

314
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,294
You know what it's like.

315
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:59,798
It's tough trying to receive packages
without your parents finding out.

316
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:03,051
It's a huge mess!

317
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:04,803
Should I tell our professor?

318
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,433
Hello.

319
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:11,893
Hey, Sol.

320
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:15,772
Have you still not decided on your school?
The professor always asks me that.

321
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,275
No, I haven't yet.

322
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:25,365
Our professor would obviously
want you to go to an elite university,

323
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,494
but you should choose the one
you really want to go to.

324
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,622
All right. I will. Thanks.

325
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:33,999
No problem.

326
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,709
-You can talk to me anytime.
-Okay.

327
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:38,545
Is this a counseling room now?

328
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:47,512
Did you order a package?

329
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:48,972
It could be the delivery guy.

330
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:51,057
-Take the call.
-For God's sake.

331
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,851
All right.

332
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:56,313
Hello?

333
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,482
<i>Hello. This is Jung Ju-hyeok.</i>

334
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:01,026
What? Who?

335
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:05,071
<i>Oh, you asked me to call you.
We met at the cafe.</i>

336
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:10,285
I'm so sorry.

337
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:12,871
I'm okay. Are you all right?

338
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:18,335
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

339
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:21,713
If you tell me your bank account
and price, I'll send you the money.

340
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,174
Well…

341
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:27,594
If you're free, could we meet up?

342
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:30,555
What? In person?

343
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:35,685
Hang on.

344
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,563
-Bye.
-Bye.

345
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,736
He's obviously trying to hit on her.

346
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:47,530
Stop being so nosy.

347
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:49,449
Gosh.

348
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,160
Romance is in the air now.

349
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:54,162
How adorable.

350
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:55,789
As you can see now,

351
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:01,670
sometimes a character looks directly
at the camera.

352
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:04,089
The audience watching the film

353
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:07,342
would feel like they've locked eyes
with the actor

354
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:09,010
-and be startled.
-Wake up.

355
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,973
We call this
the "Tension to Camera" method.

356
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,892
-The character points a gun
-What's wrong?

357
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:17,727
-at the camera
-Are you sick?

358
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,437
or throws a punch…

359
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,607
<i>Why are bad hunches never wrong?</i>

360
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:26,194
Then the camera shakes.
This is another example of that.

361
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,445
I'll get it.

362
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:30,824
-No, let me…
-No, I'm the one who dropped it.

363
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:31,992
I'll get it.

364
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:36,997
Director François Truffaut.

365
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,416
I'm sure you would've
heard his name before.

366
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:43,753
In the last scene
of the film <i>The 400 Blows</i>,

367
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:47,465
the boy escapes from the juvenile center
and runs toward the ocean.

368
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,509
<i>I have rotten luck,</i>

369
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,262
-<i>and a zit pops up on my chin.</i>
-And he looks directly…

370
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,765
-<i>It's that day of the month.</i>
-Back then, it was taboo for actors…

371
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,393
ARE YOU COMING?
CAN YOU GET ME A PAD ON YOUR WAY?

372
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:00,145
Come on, go easy on me.

373
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:01,104
All right.

374
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:02,188
Gosh, seriously!

375
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,232
Darn it.

376
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:13,658
My stomach still hurts.

377
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:16,870
Drink that.

378
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:26,421
I feel a little better now.

379
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,591
Hey!

380
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:32,761
Gosh, you're going backward.

381
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,096
Let's take a short break.

382
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:43,354
-Jae-eon! Aren't you going for a smoke?
-Go ahead first.

383
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,023
Do you want to come?

384
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:49,819
I have to prepare for my presentation.

385
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:51,404
Oh, you're presenting today?

386
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:53,114
I should really focus

387
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,408
and clap really loudly.

388
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,203
Go ahead.

389
00:26:58,286 --> 00:26:59,621
What?

390
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:02,957
Well, your friends are leaving.

391
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,709
Go catch up with them.

392
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:06,711
Okay.

393
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:10,924
You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.

394
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,896
I didn't…

395
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:27,649
Let's go.

396
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:34,280
What a relief.

397
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,082
Gosh, what is this?

398
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,836
I got totally fooled by this.

399
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:52,674
<i>You sometimes</i>

400
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:54,926
suddenly act cold to me.

401
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,011
Gosh, it's really bothering me.

402
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:02,600
Hello, I'm Sculpture major, Yu Na-bi.

403
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:11,609
Well…

404
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:17,782
The film I'm presenting today

405
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,494
is known
as the first science fiction film…

406
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,374
<i>Code red alert.</i>

407
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,710
<i>It's for real this time.</i>

408
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:30,753
It's…

409
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,137
<i>A Trip to the Moon.</i>

410
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:42,307
Director Georges Méliès
was also a magician.

411
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,350
<i>"Everyone, having your period</i>

412
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:47,645
-<i>is nothing to be ashamed of."</i>
-He was praised for his filming methods.

413
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:50,815
-<i>Yes. That's right.</i>
-Most of all…

414
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,527
At the time, films were not much different
from theater stages.

415
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:56,905
The director made a unique mise-en-scène

416
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:59,282
that was different
from reality or theater stages

417
00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:01,326
by applying perspective,
space, distortion--

418
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:02,702
Wait.

419
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,872
You're talking too fast.

420
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:08,041
Slow down and speak clearly.

421
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:11,794
Okay. Well…

422
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:13,588
<i>But periods are…</i>

423
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:15,882
<i>disasters.</i>

424
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:20,053
Hello, I'm Fashion Design major,
Kim Yeong-min.

425
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:25,308
<i>Disaster victims must evacuate</i>

426
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,228
-<i>to a safe zone.</i>
-It is about Nosferatu.

427
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:30,605
This film is actually an adaptation

428
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,358
of the novel <i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker.

429
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,361
He changed the character's names
and some details

430
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:40,198
to avoid copyright issues
when he made the film.

431
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,494
Yu Na-bi!

432
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:51,000
Did I do something…

433
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,981
What are you doing?
You said you have a night class.

434
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:14,440
You'll get cold later.

435
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,318
Should I take it back?

436
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,323
But still, it could get on your--

437
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:23,533
It's fine.

438
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,078
<i>I feel like crying.</i>

439
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,538
<i>Why did it have to be Jae-eon?</i>

440
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:29,872
Will you tell…

441
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:34,586
other people?

442
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,799
Is that what you think of me?

443
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,303
Then if you saw me

444
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:46,472
suddenly getting a boner during class,

445
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,850
would you tell the others?

446
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,227
That's different, though.

447
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:52,645
It's not the same,

448
00:30:54,063 --> 00:30:55,189
but would you?

449
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,776
Of course not.

450
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:02,447
Really?

451
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:05,158
Of course.

452
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:08,494
Then I won't, either.

453
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,333
<i>Would someone like him</i>

454
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,586
<i>really be considered frivolous?</i>

455
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:44,530
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.
I WILL GET YOUR CLOTHES…

456
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:57,877
<i>Did you get home okay?</i>

457
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:03,174
<i>Do people act like this
to keep someone on the hook?</i>

458
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,135
<i>You read my message right away.
What are you doing?</i>

459
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,147
LAUNDROMAT

460
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,401
We're going to play basketball
and go out for drinks.

461
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,152
You should join us.

462
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:24,862
Next time. I have plans.

463
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,657
But weren't you wearing a shirt over that?

464
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:29,492
Where did you put it?

465
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:31,160
I lent it to my friend.

466
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:32,203
Friend?

467
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,205
Who was that pretty girl a while ago?

468
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:35,790
Are you two close?

469
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:37,500
Did we seem close?

470
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,426
<i>I'm buying art supplies.</i>

471
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:48,261
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

472
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,182
You said you're just friends.

473
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,729
Gosh. We are just friends.

474
00:32:58,563 --> 00:33:01,065
We did get a bit close, though.

475
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:04,444
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

476
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:05,820
Don't change the subject.

477
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,531
Is there something going on?

478
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:11,367
It's not like that.

479
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,120
I'm just…

480
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,664
not pushing away someone

481
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:19,667
who's being nice to me.

482
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,337
You're really getting your hopes up.

483
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:27,967
So you're saying he's treating you
like someone special.

484
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,051
Well…

485
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:31,637
Maybe.

486
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,849
From what I've seen so far,

487
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:38,144
the things that made you feel special

488
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,937
might be meaningless to him.

489
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:43,149
I told you, he's nice to everyone

490
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:44,817
without any exception.

491
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:48,821
I don't know.

492
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,699
Maybe.

493
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:57,246
She has to realize it herself.

494
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,791
Don't blame me later for not warning you!

495
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,173
Are you free tomorrow?

496
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:09,926
-Don't you have a gathering?
-Jae-eon told you?

497
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,053
I guess you two did grow close.

498
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,680
Did you hear who's coming?

499
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:16,390
No.

500
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,769
You should come.
All persons of interest are coming.

501
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:23,272
"Persons of interest?"

502
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,441
It's going to be fun.

503
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,444
And shouldn't you check for yourself?

504
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:30,988
What?

505
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:33,783
Whether you're really special
to Jae-eon or not.

506
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:51,759
"Navi bobo"?

507
00:34:51,843 --> 00:34:53,094
NAVI_BOBO: I LIKE YOUR NEW HAIR

508
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,643
2,432 FOLLOWERS

509
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,734
All of them are girls.

510
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:11,529
2,432 FOLLOWERS

511
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:20,872
<i>I want my heart to keep fluttering,</i>

512
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,250
<i>but I keep feeling anxious.</i>

513
00:35:35,094 --> 00:35:37,471
<i>What do I want from Jae-eon?</i>

514
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,338
<i>Right.</i>

515
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:13,049
<i>I should just check for myself
and forget about him.</i>

516
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:20,973
<i>Bit-na, I'll join you tomorrow.</i>

517
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,021
Hey, isn't Sol coming today?

518
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:28,814
She's close to you.

519
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,316
Not really.

520
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,109
She's only close to Ji-wan.

521
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:35,947
And our department ace would never
eat at the same table as us.

522
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,074
You have lunch with her often.

523
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:39,617
You're so dramatic.

524
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,953
Don't you know what a metaphor is?

525
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:44,705
What are you, a kid?

526
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:45,748
Can't you stay still?

527
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,833
He's always been like that.

528
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,836
You're excited thinking
about Sol, aren't you?

529
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,588
Do you have a crush on her?

530
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,633
She's so quick-witted.

531
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,385
Help me out, then.

532
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,679
Take charge of your own love life.

533
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:01,180
Yun Sol?

534
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,183
She's pretty.

535
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:07,353
She's also sassy and extremely skilled.

536
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,438
She's totally my style.

537
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:13,109
-But does she even like guys?
-What are you on about?

538
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,568
I mean,

539
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:17,029
I've never seen her hang out with guys.

540
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:18,906
Have you?

541
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,951
I've never seen Gyu-hyun
hang out with girls, either.

542
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,077
Then is he…

543
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,080
Are you?

544
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,208
-What about me? Am I a guy, then?
-Yes.

545
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,002
-You jerk.
-Wait.

546
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,837
-Let me give you a punch.
-Hey, stop.

547
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:36,298
What are you guys up to?

548
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:37,675
You haven't quit yet?

549
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:39,844
I knew it.

550
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,638
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

551
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,932
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

552
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:47,685
Ji-wan.

553
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,895
What's he up to now?

554
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:53,441
Can I ask you a favor?

555
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,359
A favor? What is it?

556
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,821
We're going out for drinks today.

557
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,531
Come join us with Sol.

558
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,324
Sol? Why?

559
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,118
Please bring her over.

560
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,078
Let him get rejected so he can shut up.

561
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:08,164
You have a crush on her?

562
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,166
I think I do.

563
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:14,378
Help me out, okay?

564
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:17,298
Come on. Help me get close to her.

565
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,424
Okay?

566
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,426
He's serious.

567
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,261
Well, okay. I'll ask her.

568
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:23,179
Nice.

569
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,890
But she might refuse.
She doesn't enjoy drinking.

570
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:28,601
I know. I'm pretty sure she won't come.

571
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,269
Okay.

572
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,564
-Let's go.
-You're coming? Really?

573
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:34,690
Why?

574
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,486
What do you mean? Didn't you want to go?

575
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:39,945
What?

576
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,823
Oh, right. You're right.

577
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:44,241
Okay, let's go together.

578
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:46,243
What's that reaction?

579
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,167
By the way,
what do you think of Yu Se-hun?

580
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:55,628
What about him?

581
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,506
You're not that interested in him, right?

582
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,927
He seemed pretty funny.

583
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,054
He's funny?

584
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:06,847
Yes.

585
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,771
Why?

586
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,064
I don't want this.

587
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,610
Se-hun, you look really stylish today.

588
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,948
Hey. This jacket's worth 20 million won.

589
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,200
-Really?
-He's loaded!

590
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:30,121
-Then buy us a big bowl of stew!
-He could just buy us this place!

591
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:34,125
-Se-hun!
-Keep it coming!

592
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,209
Hey, Na-bi's here.

593
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,794
-Hi, Na-bi.
-Hi, Na-bi.

594
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:37,878
-Any empty…
-Let's see.

595
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,380
Go over there.

596
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:42,424
Na-bi. Come sit over here. Come here.

597
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:43,843
Go sit there.

598
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:45,719
Come on.

599
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:47,638
It's been a while.

600
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,432
You're attending gatherings
since you broke up?

601
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,768
You're finally free of that old dude?

602
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:54,895
She's free!

603
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:56,438
What's with you?

604
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,482
Did you break up?

605
00:39:58,566 --> 00:39:59,483
You broke up?

606
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,986
Why are you asking that?

607
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:05,990
Everyone's here except Jae-eon, right?

608
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,409
He's not reading my message.

609
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:09,952
He always replies late.

610
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,955
Right. He's always
holding his phone, though.

611
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,959
He just reads the alerts and ignores them.

612
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,420
No, he's not that type.

613
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,756
-Where should he sit?
-We can get a chair here.

614
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,178
<i>"Not the dating type"?
It's like he's dating all the girls.</i>

615
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,679
Jae-eon's really popular.

616
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:35,186
We should add more chairs.

617
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,687
Sol and Ji-wan are coming, too.

618
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,980
Really?

619
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,524
No way. Sol is coming?

620
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:43,485
Didn't you hear
that Ji-wan's coming as well?

621
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,946
Hang on. Let me get a chair.

622
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,490
It's nice that you never change.

623
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:50,993
-Why are you putting that next to you?
-Because I want to.

624
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,205
Aren't you taking it off?

625
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,208
What?

626
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:02,046
Your jacket. Why are you so startled?

627
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,131
What were you thinking?

628
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,217
You take it off too.

629
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:08,719
I wasn't thinking of anything.

630
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,388
Take off your jackets, guys. It's hot.

631
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,265
-You take it off.
-Oh, that's my water.

632
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,143
Oh, sorry.

633
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,604
-Is there a new cup anywhere?
-It's fine.

634
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:22,399
You're my senior, right?

635
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,403
It's nice to meet you.
I'm a freshman. Kim Eun-han.

636
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:31,492
We ordered some food already.
Have you tried the seafood stew here?

637
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,244
No, I never tried it.

638
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,828
Do you like seafood?

639
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,956
Yes, I do.

640
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,582
That's a relief.

641
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:42,628
-Hey, go check the order.
-We're selling food at the flea market.

642
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,255
You should come visit our booth.

643
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,215
<i>We killed time with useless conversations,</i>

644
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:47,758
-<i>but the food wasn't served.</i>
-Please.

645
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,635
Yes, of course.

646
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:50,970
-<i>When things started to get boring…</i>
-Really?

647
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:51,887
Yes.

648
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,430
-Did he reply?
-No.

649
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:54,640
<i>…the main character appeared.</i>

650
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:55,933
It's Jae-eon!

651
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,559
-Hey!
-Why are you so late?

652
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,353
-Jae-eon!
-Hey! What took you so long?

653
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,272
-Look at the time!
-Don't you see what time it is?

654
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:04,149
-Your pretty face won't cut it.
-Sit over here.

655
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:07,319
<i>The sexual tension
rises dramatically at his arrival.</i>

656
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:09,154
-He should drink for being late!
-Why are you late?

657
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,781
Sorry, there was a bit of traffic.

658
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:14,827
Na-bi, you're here too.

659
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:16,453
Yes.

660
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:18,706
He's here, so let's all drink!

661
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:19,957
-Let's drink!
-Here we go!

662
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,585
-Let's clink and drink!
-Let's clink and drink!

663
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,713
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

664
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:26,922
Air clink.

665
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:30,634
This tastes so sweet.

666
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,137
I'm going to drink so much today.

667
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,722
This is spicier than I thought.

668
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,348
-Just eat.
-Here, have some water.

669
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,517
-Where are they going?
-Hey, stop it.

670
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,435
Drink some water.

671
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:41,562
Thanks.

672
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:43,647
He's so popular.

673
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:44,690
It's pretty spicy.

674
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,735
It's so surprising that she came here.

675
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:49,445
I asked her to join us.

676
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:51,697
It was that easy?

677
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,283
Gosh, stop it.

678
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,784
-Is it spicy?
-Is it?

679
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:00,956
Look at you, you're all red.

680
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:05,586
Aren't girls better at eating spicy food
than guys?

681
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,296
Is that so?

682
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,256
I read somewhere

683
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,302
that women naturally endure pain better
since they have to give birth.

684
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:16,513
And you know, when it's their first time--

685
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:17,723
What did you say?

686
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:21,143
Damn it, I'm losing my appetite.

687
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:23,896
I should report you.

688
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:24,897
Stop the nonsense.

689
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,398
Hey.

690
00:43:26,482 --> 00:43:28,484
Why do you always cross the line?

691
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,277
What?

692
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,905
Tasting spiciness
is feeling a sense of pain.

693
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:34,823
Stop treating me like a pervert.

694
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,910
Just wipe your dirty mouth.

695
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:41,663
Wow. Sol, you're so cool.

696
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,123
Stop it.

697
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:53,717
Hey!

698
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,304
Here. Have a drink.

699
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:58,430
You ruined the vibe!

700
00:43:58,514 --> 00:43:59,890
-What have you done?
-Stop talking!

701
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,100
You want to drink something?

702
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:02,643
-Exactly!
-Do something.

703
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:03,769
-Yes!
-Let's bring back the vibe.

704
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:05,187
-Let's go!
-Should we keep it going?

705
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,106
-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!

706
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,441
-This one.
-Zero, zero, seven!

707
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,237
Lime? Is this good?

708
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,572
I don't know. I think you'll like it.

709
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:17,991
Me?

710
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,618
You said so at the club.

711
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,662
Here.

712
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,040
Is this lime?

713
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:26,208
I like lime.

714
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,301
You remember that?

715
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,397
It's strange.

716
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:51,400
Don't people try smoking out of curiosity?

717
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:52,818
You tried mine before.

718
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:55,154
What? When?

719
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:58,574
You always refused when I offered.

720
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:00,284
I was just curious.

721
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,578
Forget it. I feel so hurt now.

722
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:04,788
Na-bi,

723
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:07,291
you look like you're in a good mood.

724
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:13,463
What do you mean?

725
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:16,341
You looked a bit upset
so I thought you weren't feeling well.

726
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,303
I was uncomfortable with too many people.

727
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:22,347
Right. You're shy with strangers.

728
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:23,765
Even with me?

729
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:28,312
You weren't like that before.
You smiled all the time.

730
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,897
I thought you were angry.

731
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,483
Gosh. Why are you showing
so much interest in her today?

732
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,111
What?

733
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,615
Is there something going on
between you two?

734
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,200
It seems like it.

735
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,994
I did think it was strange.

736
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:44,953
It's…

737
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,413
It's nothing like that.

738
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,333
Don't lie to me.

739
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,210
I can tell by your expressions.
Aren't I right?

740
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:54,087
What's with you? There's nothing going on.

741
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,423
Right?

742
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,095
Yes.

743
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,014
Right.

744
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,515
No?

745
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,142
That's strange.

746
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,519
Didn't you keep looking at him, Na-bi?

747
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:11,980
You kept looking at him.

748
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,857
I'm going to the bathroom.

749
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,818
I'll come with you. Damn it.

750
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:22,324
He doesn't know how you feel,

751
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,451
so he said that in case
it would get awkward.

752
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:26,286
Forget it.

753
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,288
If that was really the case,

754
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:32,459
he would've just changed the subject
or said something vague.

755
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,546
Right?

756
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,050
<i>I'm sure he didn't say that just for me.</i>

757
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:42,844
He just drew the line.

758
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:45,013
Hey, don't say it like that.

759
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:48,016
-You're overreacting.
-Didn't you know this would happen?

760
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,309
What's with the pep talk?

761
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:52,271
Well, I thought maybe
I was being too harsh.

762
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:54,773
It's not like I can read his mind.

763
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:57,317
Plus, he kept looking at you.

764
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,571
No way. He was busy chatting with Yun-ji.

765
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:05,367
No! He kept glancing at you
whenever you spoke.

766
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:07,536
And most importantly,

767
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,749
he doesn't do stuff like this.

768
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,382
Bit-na, this is just a 3,000 won drink.

769
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,759
Anyway, this is different.

770
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:26,263
Honestly, I wasn't sure
when I heard your side of the story,

771
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:29,057
but seeing it in person,
I can sense something.

772
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,148
Are you going to stay?

773
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,816
No. I want to go home.

774
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,569
Let's go to your place with Jae-eon.

775
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:43,030
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

776
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,531
I'll come with you!

777
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:46,533
We can't waste an opportunity like this.

778
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,369
But still…

779
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:53,582
Forget it. I'm going to go home.

780
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:54,833
I don't feel like it.

781
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,377
Let's at least ask him.

782
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,545
Goodness.

783
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,423
There's really nothing going on
between you two?

784
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:04,092
I know. You said you don't date.

785
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,512
It seems like she's hitting on you
without knowing that.

786
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,308
She was acting like she's all that
because she's a bit pretty.

787
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,018
Serves her right.

788
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:16,772
Min-sang, don't say stuff about people
you can't say to their faces.

789
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,315
-What?
-You're badmouthing her

790
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,900
just because you can't have her.

791
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:21,610
It's pathetic.

792
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,070
What did you just say?

793
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:24,821
I'm telling you to watch your mouth.

794
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:31,661
You asshole. You just said there was
nothing going on between you and Na-bi.

795
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,790
-Hey, where were you?
-<i>Pajeon</i> must be out.

796
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,708
Come on, or I'll eat everything.

797
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,210
Yes, I'm coming.

798
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,214
Let's go eat.

799
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,678
<i>Jae-eon seems totally unbothered.</i>

800
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:53,809
Don't worry about him.

801
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:57,854
-What?
-He goes around talking about me, too.

802
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,857
Like what?

803
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,151
That you don't date?

804
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:08,532
Do people have to date?

805
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,868
Not necessarily.

806
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:13,703
Right?

807
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:18,458
I have a friend who doesn't date either.

808
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:22,087
But unlike you, he's a bit cold.

809
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,088
Especially to girls.

810
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:26,133
Why can't two people

811
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,718
just be close?

812
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:31,763
Can't they look at each other

813
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:34,307
or stand near each other?

814
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,109
Do they have to pretend not to notice

815
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,778
if there's something in their hair?

816
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,617
That's not what I mean.

817
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:54,661
Right?

818
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:56,997
It's nice to get along well.

819
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,877
<i>"Is that really all?"</i>

820
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:04,588
<i>But I didn't ask him that.</i>

821
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,381
Who wants to go for another round?

822
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:08,925
Me!

823
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,427
-Just go home.
-You go!

824
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,720
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

825
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,805
Are you going?

826
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,682
-Well…
-Jae-eon, are you going?

827
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,393
Well, if everyone's going…

828
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,187
I have other plans.

829
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,355
What? Is it important?

830
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:23,648
It's just a friend.

831
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,487
<i>Today seems like a perfect day
to get rid of my feelings.</i>

832
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:36,495
What is it?

833
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:40,290
I'm wondering if I should
see my friend or join the others.

834
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:41,583
What about you?

835
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:45,795
<i>But I…</i>

836
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:49,216
Well…

837
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,344
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house.

838
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:53,428
Do you want to come?

839
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,267
<i>I give up that chance</i>

840
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:01,770
<i>and decide to become a fun girl.</i>

841
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,105
<i>National!</i>

842
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:06,191
-Singing Contest!
-Singing Contest!

843
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,155
All right. "Love."

844
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,532
-"Love"?
-"Love."

845
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:14,866
<i>I've fallen in love</i>

846
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,827
<i>-I've fallen in love
-I've fallen in love</i>

847
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,664
<i>Love, love, love, my love</i>

848
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,123
You don't know?

849
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,001
<i>Come here, my love</i>

850
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:27,504
-You don't know this?
-Keep going. What's wrong?

851
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:29,172
We won't accept that. Drink up.

852
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:31,091
-Drink.
-But I…

853
00:51:31,174 --> 00:51:34,636
-Drink up.
-I'll drink it for you.

854
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:36,596
What was that?

855
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,556
All right.

856
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,474
<i>Keep it going</i>

857
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:40,934
<i>-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!</i>

858
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:42,644
Let's do the Alphabet Game.

859
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:44,854
-"L"!
-"L"?

860
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,190
Lion.

861
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:48,733
Leaf.

862
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:49,818
I got it. Lie!

863
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:51,236
Love.

864
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:54,573
Oh, me! Left!

865
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,074
Life.

866
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:57,492
Long.

867
00:51:57,576 --> 00:51:58,618
Gosh, what do I do?

868
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,078
-Only the two of you left.
-Wait. Let me think.

869
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,246
What do I do?

870
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:04,624
I know! Lust!

871
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:08,461
-Oh, come on!
-What? It starts with "L"!

872
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:09,796
Yes, you're right. Fine.

873
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:10,755
Gosh.

874
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:14,759
All right. Then Na-bi is the loser!

875
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:16,928
You have to drink the whole glass

876
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,264
-in one go. Here.
-In one go.

877
00:52:19,347 --> 00:52:21,266
<i>Who's going to drink?</i>

878
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,977
<i>-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!
-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!</i>

879
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:28,023
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

880
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,609
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

881
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:34,195
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

882
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,823
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

883
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:42,871
-Oh, my gosh!
-What the hell?

884
00:52:42,954 --> 00:52:45,290
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

885
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:47,000
All right. Be quiet.

886
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,210
-What? You're going to do it?
-Are you?

887
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:50,879
Okay, move over.

888
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,841
What? Really?

889
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,222
Let me do it properly.

890
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:06,478
Wait. I think I'm bleeding.

891
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:08,104
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm bleeding. But it's okay.

892
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,439
Your braces?

893
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:11,775
This is crazy!

894
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:12,776
No way!

895
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,072
-That's crazy!
-That's crazy!

896
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:19,199
Guys, be quiet.

897
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,743
The neighbors will complain.

898
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:24,579
Hey, keep it down.

899
00:53:26,998 --> 00:53:28,041
What?

900
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:29,459
I told you to be quiet.

901
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:30,710
Sorry.

902
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:31,628
Yes?

903
00:53:35,006 --> 00:53:35,965
Excuse me.

904
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:41,513
Don't you know how late it is?
Please be quiet.

905
00:53:41,596 --> 00:53:43,515
You're being way too loud.

906
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:45,392
I'm sorry.

907
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:47,394
You have neighbors, you know.

908
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:52,023
I have some friends over, so…

909
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,485
We'll be careful.

910
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,447
We're taking an exam tomorrow.

911
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:00,824
Oh, really?

912
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:04,202
Then we'll silently pray for you
to get a good score.

913
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:05,787
Thank you.

914
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:08,957
We'll trust that you'll be quiet.
Bye, then.

915
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,668
-Bye.
-I'm sorry.

916
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,855
You were like a couple.

917
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,022
Be quiet.

918
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,608
-Stop playing drinking games.
-We can't stop!

919
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,736
-Come on.
-Come on!

920
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:40,071
Let's not stop!
Let's spin it one more time!

921
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,364
Spin it!

922
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,866
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

923
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:45,076
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

924
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,828
Just a little more.

925
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:48,955
-It's me!
-Yes!

926
00:54:49,038 --> 00:54:51,207
-It's me!
-What are you talking about?

927
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,500
It's me.

928
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:54,502
-Sol. Come here.
-What?

929
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,296
-You're going to do it?
-She must be drunk.

930
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,173
You're really going to kiss her?

931
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:00,717
-Hey.
-Sit back down.

932
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,260
Sit down.

933
00:55:02,343 --> 00:55:03,344
Come on!

934
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:04,846
Gosh.

935
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,848
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

936
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:08,141
I'm going out for a smoke.

937
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:11,227
-What about me?
-She left because of you.

938
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:12,812
Be quiet.

939
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:15,482
JUNG JU-HYEOK

940
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:16,566
This is Sol's.

941
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:18,526
Hey, Sol!

942
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,778
Hey.

943
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:22,822
Jung Ju-hyeok? Who is this guy?

944
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:23,823
Jung Ju-hyeok?

945
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:24,949
Yes.

946
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,035
That's not important right now. Spin!

947
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:28,203
Spin!

948
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:31,748
<i>-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!</i>

949
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:51,100
Did you plan this in advance?

950
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,813
What does this make us look like?

951
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:57,106
You kissed by choice, that's all.

952
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:59,234
Forget it. Let's go for a smoke.

953
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:00,276
Let's go.

954
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,653
I'm exhausted.

955
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:02,695
My legs hurt.

956
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,740
-My gosh.
-Gosh, my legs.

957
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,116
Hey, I'm wearing your shoes!

958
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,660
Oh, my back.

959
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:09,953
My shoes.

960
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,955
-I'll be back later, Na-bi.
-Okay.

961
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,082
Sol!

962
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:16,709
You're smoking too?

963
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,670
Yes. But who's Jung Ju-hyeok?

964
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,630
He just called you.

965
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:23,007
What? Oh.

966
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:24,342
Just someone I know.

967
00:56:24,425 --> 00:56:25,677
Someone you know?

968
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,804
I thought I knew everyone you knew.

969
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:29,055
You don't.

970
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,019
It's cold outside.

971
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:43,820
What were you doing?

972
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:45,864
Just taking a walk.

973
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:47,657
Your place is so nice.

974
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,075
My aunt used to live here.

975
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:54,539
Why did you make things
so hard for yourself?

976
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:58,960
I know, right?

977
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:08,052
Hey…

978
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:11,931
Sol is so beautiful up close.

979
00:57:13,057 --> 00:57:14,475
She's a goddess.

980
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,102
We get it, so just tell her!

981
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,229
Please stop torturing us!

982
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:21,191
Ji-wan.

983
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,860
What type of guy does Sol like?

984
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,695
He's driving me crazy.

985
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:28,406
I don't want to tell you.

986
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:29,657
You don't want to tell me?

987
00:57:30,283 --> 00:57:31,326
What?

988
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:34,621
Why? You said you'd help me.

989
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:36,372
She doesn't seem to know, either.

990
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:38,458
There's no way.

991
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,293
Who else would know, then?

992
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:43,880
Sol…

993
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:46,341
Yes?

994
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:49,594
She hates boring guys like you.

995
00:57:49,677 --> 00:57:53,014
Come on. I'm nothing but fun.

996
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:54,807
If you took the fun part out of me,

997
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,685
I'd be a zombie. Right?

998
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,229
Don't smoke so much.

999
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:00,730
But where's Jae-eon?

1000
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:02,315
I don't know. Is he inside?

1001
00:58:02,899 --> 00:58:04,525
You're totally ignoring me.

1002
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:07,779
He must be on his phone.
He's always calling someone.

1003
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:10,240
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Yun-ji, either.

1004
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:14,911
Did those two leave together?

1005
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,623
Call them. Come on.

1006
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,084
Let's go find them.

1007
00:58:27,548 --> 00:58:29,133
Where did he go?

1008
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:32,345
What?

1009
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,681
What? It's nothing.

1010
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:37,267
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

1011
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,310
Sure. I'll get them.

1012
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:41,062
Let me use the bathroom.

1013
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:51,489
That tickles!

1014
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:05,336
Stop it.

1015
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:10,341
It tickles!

1016
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,020
Gosh, that startled me.

1017
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:27,191
This is so embarrassing.

1018
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:31,654
Listen.

1019
00:59:32,196 --> 00:59:36,284
I know this is shameless of me,
but can you keep this a secret?

1020
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:37,827
Please don't tell the others.

1021
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:44,459
All right. I won't.

1022
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:45,668
Thank you so much.

1023
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:46,627
Thank you.

1024
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:48,838
All right. I get it.

1025
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:52,759
-Now go on.
-I won't let go of this hand.

1026
00:59:52,842 --> 00:59:54,385
Okay, don't. Just go.

1027
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:56,012
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

1028
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:56,971
I'm sorry.

1029
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,723
-When did you…
-I'll tell you later.

1030
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:00,391
Let's go.

1031
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:12,070
I must've been crazy.
How could I have thought he was Jae-eon?

1032
01:00:27,418 --> 01:00:29,796
What? That's it?

1033
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:39,639
Just tell me if you're not up for it.

1034
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:42,016
It's not like that.

1035
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:44,811
Go inside first. I need to make a call.

1036
01:01:17,343 --> 01:01:18,469
It was just a game.

1037
01:01:20,763 --> 01:01:22,265
I guess she wanted to try it.

1038
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,979
You don't need to explain.

1039
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,064
What about you?

1040
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:34,318
Didn't you want to try it?

1041
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:38,030
Why would I?

1042
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:40,992
Not at all.

1043
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:49,459
I wanted to do it with you.

1044
01:01:55,673 --> 01:01:56,883
What?

1045
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:13,524
I thought…

1046
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,527
you felt the same way.

1047
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:50,853
I won't do it if you don't want to.

1048
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:21,968
Sorry.

1049
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:52,373
<i>Just like that,</i>

1050
01:03:55,668 --> 01:03:57,461
<i>the gates of hell have opened.</i>

1051
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:49,513
<i>Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.</i>

1052
01:04:50,181 --> 01:04:52,058
<i>How are your butterflies doing?</i>

1053
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:53,225
<i>I'm going to set them free.</i>

1054
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:57,104
<i>They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up because of me.</i>

1055
01:04:57,647 --> 01:05:01,942
<i>I hope it's just love.
Not childish jealousy.</i>

1056
01:05:02,026 --> 01:05:04,570
<i>You know that he only hurts other people.</i>

1057
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:05,696
<i>Were you two close?</i>

1058
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,823
<i>Yes. We're close.</i>

1059
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:09,200
<i>Closer than you and me, anyway.</i>

1060
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:12,078
<i>That kind of presence
only comes naturally.</i>

1061
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,288
<i>Some people are gifted like that.</i>

1062
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:16,832

01:05:20,586 --> 01:05:22,129
